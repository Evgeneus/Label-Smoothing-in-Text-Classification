"Consumer Sentiment Bounced Back This Month. WASHINGTON -- Consumer sentiment bounced back a bit this month as the nation began to adjust to both the aftereffects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the U.S. air strikes on Afghanistan.</br></br>The University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment index rose to 83.4 in mid-October from 81.8 at the end of September and well above the low of 72 recorded in one week late in September. The latest number was close to the 83.6 reading in mid-September.</br></br>The university's survey showed that consumers are feeling more optimistic about the future, with the index for consumer expectations rising to 77.9 in mid-October from 73.5 at the end of September and 77.2 in mid-September.</br></br>The latest economic numbers, meanwhile, seemed to tell less about where the country is headed than where it had been after the terrorist attacks. Wholesale prices rose 0.4% in September from August, according to the Labor Department. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said retail sales plunged 2.4% last month, which was largely expected because of the terrorist attacks. ""Everyone was home watching television the week of the 11th,"" said Bryan Jordan, an economist with Banc One Investment Advisors. ""If we're looking for a silver lining in these numbers, it's that pipeline pressures continue to be well-behaved, and I think that does signal lower inflation.""</br></br>The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee isn't likely to see September's producer prices as a significant factor when it meets next month, Mr. Jordan said. He predicted at least one more round of interest-rate cuts as policy makers continue to try to prod the economy toward recovery.",1,0.33620000000000005,0.6638
"The End of Advertising?. The trouble with advertising is, frankly, that there isn't enough of it. Just in case you hadn't noticed, it's in a tailspin. Hey, this could be a catastrophe. Magazines and newspapers pay my bills. Advertising is their lifeblood (magazines get 50 percent of their revenues from ads, newspapers 80 percent). Is this the end of advertising? What about my future?</br></br>Almost everyone connected with advertising is in a funk. ""Ad Biz May Never Be the Same,"" says a headline in Advertising Age. ""Some veteran publishers are not shy about calling it {the ad decline} a depression,"" reports the industry newsletter MIN.</br></br>Here's why. In the first six months of 1991, ad revenues were down 14.4 percent at Newsweek, 18.5 percent at Business Week and 11 percent at TV Guide, reports the Publishers Information Bureau. Last week poor advertising caused Family Media Inc. to shut down its seven magazines, including Discover and Health.</br></br>Elsewhere in medialand, things aren't much better. Local and network TV ad revenues are off about 7 percent in 1991. Newspaper advertising was down in 1990 and also slipped 7 percent in the first quarter of 1991. Media company profits are being blitzed. The latest quarterly results are down 28 percent at Dow Jones & Co. compared with 1989, 87 percent at the New York Times Co. and 42 percent at The Washington Post Co.</br></br>Richard Harwood, ombudsman at The Post, speculates that a little adversity won't do the news business any harm. Maybe he's right. But how about a lot of adversity? Anyway, Harwood is near retirement, and he might feel differently if he worked at Family Media or for Psychology Today, New England Monthly, the National or California. They've all folded. In 1990, at least 20 magazines went belly up; the unofficial total so far in 1991 is 16, according to the Magazine Publishers of America. Some magazines are so desperate they're willing to slant stories to please advertisers, reports The Wall Street Journal. One health magazine reportedly offered to do a favorable story on two diet products for $25,000.",0,1.0,0.0
"How To Play Rising Rates; The Bond Boom Has Left Many Investors Vulnerable to a Surprise Jump in Interest Rates. Here's How to Protect Yourself--and Profit. Author: Ben Levisohn</br></br>Bond yields hit record lows again this week. Is it time to start positioning your portfolio for rising rates?</br></br>At first blush such a move might seem like portfolio suicide. The main drivers of rising interest rates--economic growth and inflation--are nowhere in sight. In fact, Treasury yields could fall further if the Federal Reserve starts buying bonds again in a widely anticipated maneuver known as ""quantitative easing.""</br></br>But step back from day-to-day market gyrations and a different picture emerges. Bond yields have fallen for most of the past three decades. A $1,000 investment in the U.S. government debt in 1980 would be worth about $12,970 today, according to the Ryan Labs Treasury Composite Index. Treasury prices, which move in the opposite direction of yields, have surged 9.3% this year alone.</br></br>Now consider a different era: 1949 through 1979. Over that 30-year span, a $1,000 initial investment in Treasurys would have turned into a far humbler $2,950. That's because yields soared during the period; by 1980 the yield on the 10-year Treasury had reached a record high of nearly 16%.",1,0.3306,0.6694

WASHINGTON--A gauge of U.S. inflation ticked lower last month, a sign that price pressures remain tame amid subdued economic growth and one that could ease concern from central bankers.</br></br>The producer-price index for final demand, which measures changes in the prices firms receive for their goods and services, fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in May from a month earlier, the Labor Department said Friday.

"Greenspan Doesn't See Gas Prices Falling Soon. This year's jump in natural-gas prices looks likely to be protracted, and yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan raised the possibility that those prices could become an increasing drag on the U.S. economy.</br></br>Natural gas is used to generate electricity, heat homes and manufacture a variety of chemicals, plastics and fertilizers that in turn are used to make thousands of other products. Mr. Greenspan, appearing before the House energy and commerce committee, said higher natural-gas prices have knocked ""a couple tenths [of a percentage point] off profit margins"" for U.S. companies, which are a key determinant of business investment, currently the economy's weakest spot. At the same time, the costlier fuel is likely to mean higher bills for consumers, taking spending money out of their pockets.</br></br>Mr. Greenspan said there is little prospect for natural-gas prices to fall much in coming months. ""If we stay at these very elevated prices, we are going to see some erosion in a number of macroeconomic variables.""</br></br>The Fed is already worried about the sluggish pace of economic growth and the risk that low inflation, excluding energy prices, could turn into deflation.

"Solving the Credit Card Mystery. The behavior of credit card interest rates is mysterious. The rates seem high relative to other interest rates. And while other rates have declined significantly since the early 1980s, credit card rates have not moved down much, with the result that the spread between the Treasury bill rate and credit card rates has doubled over the past decade.</br></br>Credit card issuers have not offered a good explanation of the behavior of their interest rates. About half the states have therefore imposed usury limits on credit card rates. While credit card issuers have been able to avoid these restrictions in many cases by moving their activities to other states, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.) is now proposing a national rate cap.</br></br>In fact, however, high and unvarying-credit card rates are not necessarily evidence of a failure of competition in the credit card market. Credit cards are both payment and credit devices. Cardholders can use them in lieu of cash for a variety of retail transactions. At any given time, a bit fewer than half of all cardholders also use them to access a revolving credit line of a preset amount. The use of credit cards as a payments device is growing at the rate of about 10% per year; the amount of credit card debt outstanding is growing at about a 6% annual rate and represents about 30% of all consumer installment credit.</br></br>Providers of ""interchange"" services (such as MasterCard and Visa) transmit payment information between the cardholder's and the merchant's banks. However, the issuing institution sets the card's terms, including the interest rate, the grace period, annual fees, penalties, and most other card features. While there are relatively few suppliers of interchange services, according to the Nilson Report, the main industry report, there are at least 5,000 credit card issuers in the U.S. Entry into the business is relatively easy, with individual retailers and other commercial entities of even modest size offering credit card plans.</br></br>The existence of this many suppliers normally would be expected to lead to aggressive price competition. Yet credit card rates appear to be very sticky. In addition, the rate of return to banks on credit card assets appears to be high relative to the return observed for other bank assets.

"REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): Greenspan's Recovery. The White House says the recession is over, and the anecdotal evidence suggests a recovery has begun. The lackluster response in financial markets, however, suggests widespread doubts that policy makers in Washington have a clue about how to sustain a recovery.</br></br>Specifically, markets have to be wondering about the delay in reappointing Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Colin Powell's first term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff expires in the autumn, and President Bush announced his reappointment a month ago. Mr. Greenspan's four-year term expires in a month, but Mr. Bush has made no announcement. Meanwhile, various aides, deputies and kibitzers tell reporters that the delay is an attempt to ""leverage"" the Fed to ease interest rates further.</br></br>This sounds all too much like the same advisers who urged Mr. Bush to raise taxes three months into this recession. Having abandoned their own control over fiscal policy, these advisers have since taken to lecturing Mr. Greenspan and the Fed on monetary policy. This is graceless at the least, but also probably dangerous; financial markets can see when stones are being thrown from glass houses in Washington.</br></br>Especially since Mr. Greenspan is the one U.S. official who has built some credibility in world markets lately. Amid the capital's fiscal gridlock, the Fed has had to steer the economy with its single monetary oar, and with fair results. The Fed has brought down long-term interest rates, which are the decisive rates for investment. It's done this without reigniting inflation, which except during Paul Volcker's Fed tenure, has been the expectation before every presidential election cycle.</br></br>It's true that, at 8.5% or so, long-term interest rates remain stubbornly high. But this isn't something the Fed can easily control. The Fed in the short run can dictate the fed-funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans. And the Greenspan Fed has done this, dropping fed-funds to 5.75% April 30.",1,0.3390000000000001,0.6609999999999999

"The Fed's Inflated Expectations. With the sort of attention usually reserved for royal weddings, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve convenes today and tomorrow to determine whether or not to leave the current federal funds rate unchanged. In the course of their deliberations, which closely resemble an academic seminar, the Fed governors will take into account everything from the unexpectedly large increase in the April consumer price index to its benign follow-up in May to Japan's first-quarter growth. The probable result of all this activity: a rate hike of one-quarter of one percentage point.</br></br>Why so much attention to an event once known only to Fed watchers at investment banks? The reason has little to do with whether and by how much the Fed raises the rate, though this will of course have some bearing on the immediate direction of the markets. What really matters, however, is what the Fed's action suggests about its view of the future of inflation.</br></br>After decades in which mainstream economists held that the costs of inflation were negligible, and that an inflationary monetary policy could stimulate economic growth, it is now widely appreciated (thanks to the work of Milton Friedman, Robert Lucas, Martin Feldstein and others) that stable, low inflation is essential to longer expansions and stronger growth. Thus the intense speculation: Will tomorrow be the start of another ""long march,"" a 300 basis point increase such as began in 1988 and 1994 to ward off inflation? Is the Fed going to reverse the 75 basis point decrease in interest rates in response to the last year's global turmoil and the prospect of deflation?</br></br>The change in forecasts of what the Fed will and should do has been rapid.

Is it due to a string of one-time favorable ""shocks,"" such as low oil prices, a strong dollar, and a steeper than anticipated decline in computer prices? Has that string run out?",1,0.0,1.0

(Published 3/1/94)</br></br>No matter whose plan finally emerges from the congressional operating room, health care reform holds out the prospect of redistributing tens of billions of dollars each year throughout the economy, creating an array of winners and losers among American businesses and households.</br></br>Despite these huge shifts in income from some Americans to others, most economists have concluded that the gains and losses would largely cancel each other out. The nation's total employment, inflation, economic growth and balance of trade wouldn't be affected significantly.</br></br>So far, only President Clinton's plan has been subject to serious economic analysis.

"A Break From L.A.. One secessionist says succinctly: Name another city that has a mountain range running through it.

"Wage Stagnation May Be Ending. The presumed American birthright of rising living standards has been on hold for 15 years. Average hourly pay of blue-collar and clerical workers is slightly lower in purchasing power now than it was in 1973 and has made no progress even in the prosperous mid-1980s.

In other words, we are working harder for it, and this has its cost in leisure, child care, and home-cooked meals.

Young and other marginal workers, including swelling ranks of low-income single mothers, lost ground rapidly relative to others in the general retrenchment in the 1980s.</br></br>Intense foreign competition, due mainly to exchange-rate maladjustments, held down wages (as well as prices and profits) in the mid-1980s in all industries exposed to international competition. Some of the lag in average wages stemmed from erosion of union wage scales that were out of line with the rest of the economy. Union wages in manufacturing, construction and transportation have been undermined by spreading nonunion competition.

"Social Security Off-Budget: Expensive Idea. One of the more important deficit-reducing events of the 1980s was the Social Security reform of 1983. The Social Security system is now running sizable surpluses that are being used to help meet federal deficit targets under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. The Social Security surplus thus masks the seriousness of the deficit problem in the rest of government.</br></br>For this reason, many propose that deficit targeting be altered. They would target the rest of the government's deficit and move Social Security completely off-budget. While I am in strong agreement with the goals of the reformers, I worry that they are pursuing their goals with a highly risky mechanism.</br></br>Following such a change, increases in Social Security benefits would no longer count against the official budget deficit. Given the strong political support for Social Security, the removal of budget discipline from the system would create an enormous temptation for politicians to spend some of the accumulated surplus. There is a long list of claimants and many expensive proposals have been made to correct perceived inequities in the system.</br></br>Having allowed Social Security completely off-budget, it would be hard not to extend the same privilege to other trust funds. For example, the Medicare and civil-service pension trust funds would have a particularly strong claim to off-budget status. Both programs have contributed significantly to deficit reduction in the recent past. But if allowed off-budget, they are unlikely to do so in the future.</br></br>More important, the Social Security benefit structure itself should not be allowed to escape budget scrutiny forever. Formidable political forces are now arrayed against any restraint on benefit growth, and Social Security is far from the political bargaining table. But that has not always been true, and there are reasonable options that would save many billions of dollars in the long run.",0,0.6796,0.3204
"Washington Isn't Spending Too Much; It's normal for deficits to rise during a downturn.The real fiscal challenge is decades down the road..

Each candidate decried the rise of government spending and wants to cut taxes.</br></br>Again and again they noted that spending under President Obama rose to 25% of the economy in 2009, the highest in decades and well over the 20%-21% norm of the last 30 years.</br></br>To hear the GOP candidates tell it, this fact explains the deficit, explains America's long-run fiscal problem, and explains why new taxes cannot be tolerated. Congressional Republicans have the same outlook. The deficit is up thanks to government spending, so we must cut spending right now in every form.</br></br>Yet the long-run fiscal problem facing the country--which is real--has almost nothing to do with the reasons that the deficit is currently large or that spending is abnormally high.

"There Is No 'Structural' Unemployment Problem; A look at the skills-jobs mismatch finds no evidence that changes in the economy explain high joblessness. The problem is slow growth.. The unemployment rate has exceeded 8% for more than three years. This has lead some commentators and policy makers to speculate that there has been a fundamental change in the labor market. The view is that today's economy cannot support unemployment rates below 5%--like the levels that prevailed before the recession and in the late 1990s. Those in government may take some comfort in this view. It lowers expectations and provides a rationale for the dismal labor market.</br></br>Excuses aside, this issue is also important for central banks. The Federal Reserve and other central banks have some policy choices to make if the high rates of unemployment reflect cyclic phenomena. But if the problem is structural--perhaps reflecting a mismatch between skills needed by business and skills possessed by the unemployed--there is little the Fed can do.</br></br>Research I've done with James Spletzer of the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the problems in the labor market are not structural.

They do this by borrowing shares from a broker and selling them -- betting that the stock will fall in value and that they can replace the borrowed shares later at a lower price.</br></br>Because short-sellers thrive on corporate disasters and financial foul-ups, they are often reviled by companies whose shares they short and are accused of spreading lies to send stocks plunging.

"Prized Parts of Tax Plan May Get Ax --- `Everything's on the Table' As Republicans Seek Room For Bush Dividend Measure. WASHINGTON -- Some of the most popular provisions in President Bush's tax-cut package could get whittled down as Senate Republicans try to make room for the White House's top priority: repealing the tax that individuals pay on corporate dividends.</br></br>One benefit in Mr. Bush's proposal would boost the child tax credit to $1,000 from the current $600. The jump is expensive -- nearly $90 billion through 2013, official estimates show. By limiting the increase to one year, as some Senate tax writers are now considering, the price tag would shrivel to about $15 billion.</br></br>Another provision Republicans may target would triple the expensing limit for small businesses. The annual cap today is $25,000; under Mr. Bush's proposal, it would immediately rise to $75,000, carrying an estimated cost of about $29 billion over the next 10 years. Republicans are eyeing cheaper options, such as only doubling the cap and letting it to expire after a few years.</br></br>The changes are necessary if the Senate is to stay within its budget limit of a $350 billion, 10-year tax-cut package. If tax writers can find ways to offset extra costs, the final figure could grow to $400 billion.</br></br>Despite the $350 billion lid -- set by Republican moderates who worry about the ballooning federal deficit -- Mr. Bush wants Congress to approve the dividend-tax repeal that is the centerpiece of his economic-growth plan.

The Pentagon found that 25 programs had grown by at least 50% over original costs, while 11 programs were between 30% and 50% more expensive.</br></br>""It's not fair to say that this reflects on how we are doing in the past few years, given the broad time span"" under consideration, said Cheryl Irwin, a Pentagon spokeswoman.</br></br>For example, the prices of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s F-22 stealth fighter and Boeing Co.'s C-17 cargo jet rose more than 50%, but their original baseline costs were set years ago. The majority of affected programs date from the 1980s and 1990s, Pentagon officials said.</br></br>Legislators say the new law brings transparency to congressional oversight of the Pentagon. Defense contractors complain it fails to take into account inflation or technological and program changes that inevitably occur in long-term weapons development. Even younger programs, such as Boeing's $165-billion Future Combat Systems modernization project for the Army and Northrop Grumman Corp.'s Global Hawk unmanned spy plane, surpassed the law's 50% cost-growth threshold because of program restructurings and delays.",0,1.0,0.0

"Bashing Payday Lenders; Obama targets another industry that serves low-income Americans.. One irony of the Pelosi Congress's rush to punish banks and other financial institutions is that it has raised the price of credit for everyone, especially the poor. Now Democrats may hurt those same low-income earners again by limiting one of their few remaining sources of credit: payday lending.</br></br>Payday shops lend between $100 and $500 for short periods in advance of a customer's next paycheck, and President Obama added them to his list of financial villains in his State of His Re-Election address last week.</br></br>Lest you doubt this was a calculated hit, the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sent a note earlier this month to its email subscribers warning that payday lenders can lead consumers into ""a cycle of debt."" The bureau's new, recess-appointed chief Richard Cordray has since added race to the indictment, telling an audience in Birmingham, Alabama that ""surveys indicate that payday borrowers are disproportionately people of color."" All of this seems to be forecasting new punitive regulation.</br></br>Payday lenders charge around $15 for a two-week $100 loan to their typically high-risk borrowers, which equates to a 390% annual interest rate. Consumer groups like the liberal Center for Responsible Lending call this ""predatory,"" but the terms are reasonable compared to an average credit-card fee, which can exceed 900%, or a bounced check fee, which can top 1,500%.</br></br>Payday lenders have around 20,000 storefronts across the country and also operate on the Internet. The industry lent $40 billion in 2010, employing more than 50,000 people and serving 19 million households, according to Stephens Inc.

"Repeal Tax Cuts? There They Go Again. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle has now staked out his and his party's economic policies, and -- in tune with the styles of today -- they're retro. The Bush tax cuts, he says, could actually be making the recession worse.</br></br>To a veteran of the Reagan administration, all of this sounds pretty familiar. In 1981, shortly after the enactment of the Reagan tax cut, the economy slid into a serious recession. The tax cut, combined with the recession, resulted in a substantial deficit in 1982, and deficits ""as far as the eye could see"" thereafter.</br></br>Ronald Reagan's economic plan -- based on supply-side theory -- was a relatively new idea at the time, and the severe recession spread alarm through the political community. The deficits, it was thought, would bring back inflation, cause interest rates to rise, worsen the recession and slow or defer any recovery. The president was implored to back a tax increase, not just by the Democrats -- who wanted desperately to repeal or defer the tax cut -- but also by Republicans, who feared that the recession would decimate their ranks in the 1982 election.</br></br>Even members of the president's staff lost their nerve, with leaks from the White House complaining that Mr. Reagan would not listen to reason, and budget director David Stockman being quoted in a magazine article to the effect that Mr. Reagan didn't know what he was doing. Alone among the president's advisers, Treasury Secretary Donald Regan made the obvious point: It's absurd to raise taxes in the midst of a recession.

Despite the deficits, which did indeed continue at historic peacetime levels through Mr. Reagan's two terms in office, inflation and interest rates declined.

The spotlight in Europe's new-issue stock market is focused almost exclusively on telecommunications-industry offerings, as investors battle for the growing numbers of newly public enterprises.</br></br>Zurich-based Carrier1 International SA became the latest beneficiary of the fervor for telecommunications stocks yesterday, as investors in both Europe and the U.S. fought for a piece of the company's initial public offering. Even after both the size and the price range of the IPO were boosted by the underwriters -- led by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. and Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney -- the issue was still about 30 times oversubscribed.</br></br>The IPO of 9.375 million shares was priced at 87 euros a share ($87.27) raising $818.2 million and giving the company a stock-market value of roughly $3.5 billion. The shares priced above the range at which they had been marketed, which already had been boosted from the initial range of between $65 and $75 each. Underwriters have the option to sell an additional 1.4 million shares to help meet the excess demand.</br></br>The company, which is less than two years old, will begin trading today on both the Nasdaq Stock Market and Germany's Neuer Markt, the growth-stock division of the Deutsche Boerse.

"Some of Wall Street's Favorite Stock Theories Failed to Forsee Market's Slight Rise in 1984. It was a tough year on Wall Street. The Super Bowl theory got beat up pretty badly.</br></br>Ever since football's clash of the titans began in 1967, the Super Bowl theory has boasted a record for clairvoyance unmatched by any technical analyst, Ph.D. economist or money manager with a six-figure income. Every year the National Football Conference team won, the stock market -- as measured by the New York Stock Exchange composite index -- rose. Every year the American Football Conference team won, the market lost ground.</br></br>Last year, however, the AFC's Los Angeles Raiders won, and the New York composite unobligingly rose. The rise was only 1.26%, to be sure, but an indicator's an indicator, after all.</br></br>The Super Bowl theory wasn't the only harebrained indicator of market performance that had a tough year. The B.S. indicator didn't suggest much of anything would happen -- maybe it didn't do so badly after all -- while the hemline index wallowed in confusion. If you followed the index of men's tie widths, you probably got caught in a short squeeze.</br></br>The B.S. indicator, otherwise known as the Boston snow indicator, is the brainchild of David Upshaw, formerly of Drexel Burnham Lambert and now of Waddell & Reed, and Jody Simons, still with Drexel Burnham.

"Investing in Funds & ETFS: A Monthly Analysis --- Mixing It Up: Good Market for Actively Managed Funds? --- This adviser believes stock-picking managers are poised for improved performance vs. indexers.

"Economy's Rebound Threatens to Stir New Inflation Pressures, Higher Rates. NEW YORK -- The economy's vigorous rebound since March is threatening to spark renewed inflationary pressures and further increases in interest rates, according to economists and investment managers.</br></br>The frenzied rush of borrowing by businesses and consumers is likely to continue, setting the stage for another surge in the nation's money supply, many bankers and analysts warned. Some contended that the Federal Reserve System will tighten further its credit clamp in an effort to slow business activity to a noninflationary pace.</br></br>Intensifying the pressures on the credit markets are the federal government's massive financing needs to cover its budget deficits. This week, the Treasury will auction $16.5 billion of securities, consisting of three-year notes, 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.

"The Bad News Is The U.S. Economy Keeps Humming. As the free world's leaders meet for their annual summit, the world economy hangs on a precipice. The ""twin deficits"" are turning America into a banana republic. The weight of debt threatens turmoil in the Third World. Only urgent action will save the day: The dollar must fall and taxes must rise.</br></br>Sound familiar? It should, because such dread and dismay have been the conventional economic wisdom, at least among political and media elites, on the eve of every economic summit in the 1980s. Just a year or even six months ago, the apocalyptics were still in full cry. So as the decade's last economic summit unfolds in Paris after yet another year of growth, it's as good a time as any to examine how wrong the fear and loathing has been.</br></br>My favorite doomsayer is Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics, a frequently quoted outfit that has served as an inverse indicator during the 1980s; whatever it says will happen almost certainly won't. Last May, Mr. Marris told the Business Council that, ""If the next president of the United States . . . does not act immediately and decisively to cut the budget deficit, he is going to preside over the decline and fall of this great nation.""</br></br>Mr. Marris was building on his earlier insight, offered in 1984, that ""time is running out."" If $150 billion wasn't cut from the U.S. budget deficit by 1987, he wrote, ""the present recovery in both the United States and the rest of the world will come to an untimely end."" Alas the recovery, like the nation, keeps rolling along.</br></br>It's unfair to single out Mr. Marris, so let's widen the memory net. Fred Bergsten, his partner in prophecy at IIE, wrote last November that, ""there is still time to avert disaster,"" if only then President-elect Bush would raise taxes and devalue the dollar.

"Clinton aides see improving trend in productivity. WASHINGTON -- President Clinton's economic advisers say the trend in U.S. productivity growth may be improving, boosting the prospects for growth in living standards in coming years.</br></br>The Economic Report of the President, released yesterday, said the growth in U.S. productivity, which is a measure of the output per hour worked, has averaged about 2% a year since 1991 -- more than twice the 1978-87 average.

Such an increase could have positive implications for Americans' standards of living, which are ultimately determined by the productivity of American workers.</br></br>But the president's economic report also points out that it may be too soon to jump to conclusions about productivity growth.

"Arrests Prompt 2nd Suit; Activists Detained During Fall Protests.

"U.S. News: Hints of Stability Emerge in Fragile Financial System. Even as job losses mount and profits plunge, some glimmers of stabilization are emerging in global markets.</br></br>In the U.S., Europe and China, separate surveys of manufacturers' purchasing managers all inched upward in January, suggesting that the contraction in manufacturing activity could be slowing. The interest rates at which banks lend to one another are easing. And some credit markets are thawing.</br></br>Analysts say rock-bottom official interest rates, promises of massive fiscal-stimulus packages and central banks' other efforts to revive markets have helped ease some tensions in financial markets and may help put a floor under falling business confidence. As the government rescue efforts work their way through the markets, they could lay the groundwork for the global economy to begin escaping the worst of the storm.</br></br>But the current hints of stabilization come at very low levels, and with the financial system still fragile, suggesting the year ahead will be rocky at best. And the hopeful signs could still turn ugly, especially with employment falling and draining household incomes.</br></br>""Some of the numbers we had been seeing were just jaw-droppingly awful,"" said Ken Wattret, economist with BNP Paribas in London.

"No Tapering Soon if the Fed Looks at Labor; A 6.5% unemployment target isn't the only concern. The employment rate matters too, and it's still looking anemic.. The Federal Reserve's Sept. 18 decision to stay the course on its asset purchases surprised and confused many market participants, who felt the central bank had sent contradictory signals about its intentions. In fact, the Fed has behaved in a way completely consistent with Chairman Ben Bernanke's public comments, at least since July. A careful look at the labor market numbers suggests that if the Fed sticks to the chairman's words, there will be no significant tapering any time soon.</br></br>Before July, the Fed announced on a number of occasions that a 6.5% unemployment rate would indicate that it is time to start raising interest rates and winding down its easy-money policies. The unemployment rate has fallen significantly from its high of 10% in October 2009 to the mid-sevens. But the labor market is still sickly because, as I pointed out in these pages in June, the employment rate--the proportion of the working-age population that has jobs--has made little progress.</br></br>The employment rate is the best single indicator of labor-market health, and it is still hovering at around 58.5%, down significantly from its pre-recession levels of over 63%. The economy is adding jobs, but just barely staying ahead of population growth. Rather than making up for ground lost during the recession, the economy is still treading water.</br></br>Mr. Bernanke and other Fed governors are clearly aware of the distinction between the unemployment and employment rates. In his July 17 congressional testimony, Mr. Bernanke said that ""if a substantial part of the reductions in measured unemployment were judged to reflect cyclical declines in labor force participation rather than gains in employment (my emphasis), the [Federal Open Market] Committee would be unlikely to view a decline in unemployment to 6.5% as a sufficient reason to raise its target for the federal funds rate."" The jobs report for August showed the decline in labor-force participation and employment rates that the Fed feared.</br></br>On Sept. 18--following the FOMC's vote to continue its current pace of bond-buying--Mr. Bernanke reinforced the message. ""The unemployment rate is not necessarily a great measure in all circumstances of the state of the labor market overall,"" he said. ""We are looking for overall improvement in the labor market.""",1,0.0,1.0

"Why Gas Costs So Much in Md.. Maryland motorists who suffer from sticker shock every time they fill their tanks routinely look for the cheapest fuel they can find. But they don't find much difference in prices from one station to the next -- or at least not as much difference as they found a few years ago. The reason lies in a fascinating tale of Annapolis favoritism.</br></br>The story begins with the 2000 spike in oil prices, which caused gas prices to soar. Consumers responded by avoiding traditional service stations and buying lower-priced gas from chains such as Sheetz and Wawa. The two convenience chains were expanding into Maryland at the time, and several grocery stores and shoppers clubs also were opening gas stations to attract customers. The sight of motorists queuing up at these retailers worried the owners of traditional service stations, who appealed to state lawmakers for help. Annapolis has a history of restricting price competition to protect politically connected businessmen, so their call did not go unheeded.</br></br>The result was legislation to prohibit retailers from selling gas below state-established minimum prices derived from weekly wholesale prices. The legislation also empowered the state comptroller to investigate reports of illegally cheap gas and gave the comptroller the authority to suspend or revoke the license of any retailer caught offering low prices. The legislation's supporters said the new law was necessary to prevent ""predatory pricing"" in which one retailer undercuts competitors to drive them out of business and then raises its prices. But I've not heard of a single instance in which Sheetz or Wawa had engaged in predatory pricing, which economists generally considered to be unworkable.</br></br>Sheetz and Wawa fought the legislation, but in vain. It passed both houses of the legislature by overwhelming margins and was signed into law by Gov. Parris N. Glendening on May 18, 2001. The following September, Comptroller William Donald Schaefer sent letters to the editors of several Maryland newspapers proclaiming the legislation to be ""good for the consumer"" and assuring motorists that the new law would not cause gas price increases. When the law went into effect that October, Sheetz and Wawa promptly raised their prices.</br></br>What would Maryland gasoline prices be like if the minimum-price law were lifted? A loophole in the law gives an indication. A gas station can lower its price below the minimum ""in good faith to meet competition."" If Sheetz or Wawa tried to lower its prices to draw customers away from a nearby service station, that would not be legal competition, and the owner of a competing station could call the comptroller's office. But what if a Sheetz store were near a Wawa outlet and they wanted to compete against one another instead of calling the comptroller? In St. Mary's County, this is happening. As of April 18, one Wawa was selling regular unleaded for $1.99; the nearby Sheetz was selling it for $2. In response, the Texaco and Shell stations down the road were selling gas for $2 a gallon. In contrast, the statewide average gas price that day was $2.22 for regular unleaded.",0,0.6688,0.33120000000000005

"Katrina, Oil and the Fed. The economic damage from Hurricane Katrina will take months to sort out, but it's not too soon to sort the good from the bad among possible government responses. The first rule of policy in a disaster should be to do no more harm.</br></br>In the category of good is the Bush Administration's decision yesterday to release some oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help Gulf Coast refiners keep operating. With oil supplies reduced, the refiners need to borrow the SPR crude or they might have to shut down. The companies will return the borrowed oil to the Reserve when private supplies are back to normal.</br></br>The Administration is also right to resist the temptation to go further and flood the market with Reserve crude, even if that would look good politically. ""The President is willing to do what it takes to relieve an oil company, but not enough to relieve the crushing burden of oil speculation and price-fixing on American consumers and small businesses,"" declared Congressman Ed Markey, thus taking the prize as the first Member of Congress to exploit this natural disaster for partisan gain. His staff should tell the Massachusetts Democrat that releasing more crude won't affect prices at the pump by one penny if the oil can't be refined into gasoline.</br></br>Far more likely to reduce gas prices is yesterday's timely decision by the Environmental Protection Agency to suspend temporarily some pollution standards on gas and diesel fuel to ease shortages. One cause of generally higher gas prices that isn't well understood by the public is the proliferation of ""boutique"" fuels to meet anti-pollution rules passed by Congressmen like Mr. Markey. These require special refining capacity, and with the shutdown of at least eight refineries it makes sense to ease these rules given the more urgent need to rebuild fuel supplies.</br></br>Even better, the EPA waived the rules for all 50 states, not just those directly hit by the hurricane. This recognizes that Katrina will end up affecting gas prices nationwide because of shortages and delivery delays, so 50-state relief ought to reduce the number of local price spikes.

"An Old Idea on U.S. Aid to States Is Floated, but Isn't Likely to Swim. The latest idea to help cash-strapped state governments and resuscitate the U.S. economy: Revive former President Richard Nixon's plan for sharing federal revenues with the states.</br></br>Alice Rivlin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former Clinton administration budget director, floated the idea this week, with a twist. From 1972 to 1980, the federal government sent unrestricted cash to the states regardless of the economic climate. Ms. Rivlin proposes creating a trigger to automatically start the payments when the economy enters a recession. This way, the federal government could come to the aid of states, helping them avoid poorly timed tax increases and social-service spending cuts.</br></br>But Mr. Nixon's fellow Republicans long ago disowned his idea, and Congress is unlikely to embrace it. Indeed, for nearly a year, states have lobbied Congress for aid only to come away empty-handed. There was bipartisan support in the Senate for a plan to temporarily raise the federal share of funding for Medicaid, a health plan for low-income and disabled people jointly paid for by the states and federal government. The idea has slowly died in the Republican-controlled House. More recently, states have failed so far to get an agreement to increase funding for cash assistance and welfare-to-work programs.</br></br>Why can't the states get any help from Washington? A majority in Congress, mainly Republicans, don't want to approve new spending because of the growing federal deficit -- exactly what killed general revenue sharing 20 years ago. They would rather approve spending for which they can take credit.</br></br>Some argue that states helped to create their own crisis by unrealistically relying on uninterrupted tax revenue fattened by '90s personal income-tax and other gains while also enacting spending programs and reducing taxes.",0,1.0,0.0

"C6 SUNDAY, MAY 16,	1982  . ÐÊ M B ROF. PAUL HURD outlines a frightening na-. 'T7' tional trend on todayÛªs op-ed page. American precollege students are heading toward scientific and technological illiteracy in a world where se-Û¢curity and prosperity increasingly depend on sci---ence and technology. Dr. Hurd presented his warning to a convocation at the National Academy of Sciences last week.</br></br>At the meeting, educators told of steadily declining student achievement in mathematics and the V sciences and of less demanding and more out-of-J date curricula. School administrators confirmed an appalling shortage of science and mathematics teachers. The superintendent of HoustonÛªs public schools reported that thousands of students had graduated without ever having had a qualified math ;.or science teacher.</br></br>. Representatives of industry, both the new high-. technology companies and the traditional ÛÏsmokestackÛ industries, warned that they are already una-ble to find workers sufficiently trained and comfort-' able with mathematics and technology, and that . their need for such workers is going to grow steadily. The secretary of defense linked the problem directly to national security because of manpower ..needs in both the armed services and defense industries. Numerous speakers reminded the audience : 'that its literate work force has been a traditional ad-' vantage of the U.S. economy since the beginning of Tthe industrial age.</br></br>Specialists reported that while science and mathematics education been allowed to fall into decline in the United States, it is being accorded the highest priority elsewhere. Prof. Hurd illustrates some df the ominous differences between this and other countries. Yet even more than in. those other societies, democracy demands that citizens understand the choices they have to make. A very small number of American students are being vtell prepared'for careers in science and engineering, but nearly everyone elseÛÓabout 98 percent of high school graduatesÛÓis leaving school as a functional illiterate in these fields, in effect denied full citizenship.</br></br>Twenty-five years ago, Sputnik galvanized the United States into the realization that it had fallen way behind.

"Bookshelf: Beefing About America's Cattlemen. As a carnivore who reluctantly eats vegetables as a concession to health, and a rancher who carries a rifle in his pickup, I may be ill-suited to review Denzel and Nancy Ferguson's ""Sacred Cows at the Public Trough"" (Maverick Publications, Bend, Ore., 97708, 250 pages, $8.95), a vitriolic indictment of the Western livestock industry. The book catalogs the inefficiencies and ecological atrocities generated by stockmen and their bureaucratic lackeys responsible for managing 217.3 million acres of federal range lands -- an area 70 times greater than Connecticut. Unfortunately, it contains just enough truth to merit consideration.</br></br>From the authors' perspective, no industry has destroyed or altered more of nature than the Western livestock industry. ""Cowboys and cows are the center of a monstrous myth, a part of Americana that rests on concocted imagery and fabrication -- an enormous falsehood based on profound ignorance."" The book attempts to substantiate these charges and concludes with the following admonition: ""The American people have little choice other than to accept the challenge of a recalcitrant, uncompromising, and coddled minority -- the public should boot every last one of them off the public lands.""</br></br>West of the Mississippi, nearly half the land is federally owned. The U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management manage this land. There are about 38,000 private permitees grazing animals on federal range. The region is arid and productivity is low. The Fergusons claim that this small group of Western stockmen controls the federal grazing programs and that the federal agencies are used as political tools to extract wealth from the general public, using it to subsidize ecologically destructive and economically inefficient grazing.</br></br>Over-grazing produces massive erosion, while productive watersheds are replaced by deserts, and native prairies are invaded by tumbleweeds, cheat grass and sagebrush. Most important is the virtual destruction of wildlife habitat. Further, the public is supporting 700 government trappers in the Animal Damage Control Program. They kill bears, mountain lions, bobcats, lynxes, coyotes and wolves to reduce livestock predation.</br></br>Range improvement programs, mandated by law in the 1970s, are correctly viewed by the Fergusons as ""a bureaucratic euphemism, a sick disguise for deceit, bad ecology and corrupt economics.""

The June report showed a slight rise in the unemployment rate to 4.5% and a relatively small fall in payroll employment of 114,000 jobs.</br></br>The market took those statistics badly. The stock market sold off, as did the long Treasury bond. Stocks were looking for more cost-cutting measures from companies, in this case a bigger drop in payroll employment. Bonds were looking for a stronger signal that the economy was weak and that the Federal Reserve would continue cutting interest rates.</br></br>But there is a little secret in the employment report that you should know about. The Labor Department said that payroll employment fell 114,000 in June. What it did not tell you is that this reported change includes a ""bias adjustment factor"" that adds about 160,000 jobs a month. This bias factor is basically picked out of thin air, and is supposed to capture employment in newly started firms that Labor misses in its survey. In other words, Labor doesn't know how many new hires occurred at new companies, so it assume a number. In its June report, it continued to guess that it missed 155,000 new hires.</br></br>The problem is that when the economy slumps, so do new business start-ups. A good indicator of new business starts is the Conference Board's index of help-wanted advertising. This index has plummeted back to levels last seen at the end of the 1990 recession. Back then, the bias factor also fell to zero, instead of hanging at the same level as in the boom period of 1998.</br></br>Compare the published payroll survey with another measure of employment, the Labor Department's household survey, which measures employment by asking a survey of people, not businesses, if they have lost their job. The household survey is used to calculate the unemployment rate, but is otherwise ignored because it is very volatile from month to month. Over the past five months this survey shows a fall in employment of more than one million. Over the same five months the published payroll survey has fallen only 45,000. However, if you remove the monthly addition of 155,000 from the bias factor, payroll employment would be down 269,000 in June and 872,000 over the past five months. Now we're talking big numbers.",1,0.3478,0.6522

"Letters to the Editor: Incentive Pay and Joblessness. Inventing economic theories in an ivory tower is no substitute for living with the harsh reality of unemployment. Your Dec. 26 page-one article ""Jobless Puzzle"" described a trendy theory among academicians that the roots of unemployment lie in the ""efficiency-wage"" problem: unemployment persists because employers are paying artificially high wages in order to motivate workers to greater productivity. This prevents workers who are willing to work at a lower wage from finding jobs.</br></br>My experience indicates otherwise. I lived in a low-income ghetto and there had a string of housemates who were unemployed when they moved in, yet healthy, young and clearly in possession of employable skills. Without exception, these men failed to follow up on job leads I gave them, they walked past help-wanted signs every day, they even refused my offer to pay them generously for household chores. They chose instead to borrow from friends during the times that their government checks for unemployment and disability (it was a fraud) fell short of their needs.</br></br>This experience was a limited one yet I believe representative of a far broader problem. The men I lived with chose unemployment because it presented them with an economically desirable alternative to a life of work. Theirs was a low standard of living yet one they had grown accustomed to and complacent with.

Sales of fall and back-to-school goods were almost uniformly ""disappointing or below expectations,"" the Fed said.</br></br>Manufacturing picked up in some districts, however. The Philadelphia Fed, for example, found strong demand for electrical machinery, metals and glass products. ""It's not a boom, mind you,"" a steel production representative cautioned the Chicago Fed. Indeed, purchase orders mostly softened in the Dallas and Cleveland districts.</br></br>In keeping with what analysts call a slow but steadily growing economy, construction improved slightly, and there was a ""firming"" in commercial and industrial leasing activity. Also, inflation remains under control. Wage gains were moderate, despite mostly tight labor markets, and reports of rapidly rising materials costs fell off substantially, the report said.</br></br>But the reluctance of consumers to spend is keeping the slow-rolling economy from shedding its training wheels.

"Fanning and 2 Other Top Editors Quit Christian Science Monitor in a Dispute. BOSTON -- The Christian Science Monitor's editor, Katherine Fanning, resigned along with her two top assistants to protest a restructuring they say will weaken the paper.</br></br>The restructuring will include staff cuts and other cost-reducing measures. It is aimed at narrowing the newspaper's losses at a time when the Christian Science Church, which owns the paper, faces financial strains from heavy outlays for a new television news program and a reduction in working funds because of the stock-market crash. A new format being considered for the Monitor would reduce the paper to 16 pages from its 28-page average, a church official said. The Monitor may also eliminate advertising.</br></br>As part of the restructuring, Richard A. Nenneman, formerly general manager of print publishing for the Monitor, will become editor-in-chief in charge of all of the church's news operations, a new position. Richard J. Cattani, formerly the Monitor's editorial page editor, succeeds Ms. Fanning as editor.</br></br>The Monitor's managing editor, David Anable, and assistant managing editor, David Winder, also resigned. In a letter to church leaders criticizing the restructuring plan, Mr. Anable said the plan calls for a 50% staff reduction and a ""new desk-top, advertising-less version"" of the Monitor that was presented to church leaders before the paper's editors had a chance to review it.</br></br>Ms. Fanning, 61 years old, assumed her post at the Monitor in 1983 after serving as editor and publisher of the Anchorage (Alaska) Daily News, which she led to a Pulitzer Prize in 1976. While she was editor of the Monitor, its circulation rose to about 170,000 from about 150,000; it peaked at about 300,000 a few decades ago.

"Manager's journal: America's corporations should swear off pork. Earlier this month an ad appeared in this newspaper entitled ""Declaration of Independence: End Corporate Welfare."" It was signed by 61 top Silicon Valley executives, including me. In calling for government to end corporate pork-barrel politics, we were taking a moral stand.</br></br>The first Americans hated taxes; the Constitution limited government and, originally, banned levies on personal income. For the first two centuries of our nation, the common man became better off more quickly than any other time in history. Per capita U.S. gross domestic product grew to $28,540 in 1996 from just $919 (in 1996 dollars) in 1776. Mankind took 30,000 years to get to $919, but only 220 more years to reach $28,540. But today the American Dream is being eroded. Since 1976 annual GDP growth per capita (expressed as a 20-year rolling average) has steadily declined, to 1.5% from 2.5%. Why? In part because federal, state and local taxes now consume a whopping 35% of our national output. Current peacetime spending is higher than the 29% peak during World War I; the all-time record was 49% during World War II.</br></br>American companies should lead in the reduction of destructive government spending. Eliminating corporate welfare is a moral imperative: We should not be asking senior citizens and the poor to tighten their belts while our government is, actually subsidizes the sale of American chardonnay to the French.</br></br>Taxing and spending to support U.S. industry creates a vicious circle. With corporate taxes high, companies lobby for give-backs to remain competitive. Congress faces extreme pressure to ""bring home the pork"" to home-state corporations. That requires even higher taxes -- and the circle continues.</br></br>Corporate subsidies are often known by euphemisms such as ""government investments"" or ""government-industry partnerships."" Such Washington-speak notwithstanding, Americans are compelled to pay for silly programs like the proposal by the Commerce Department's Advanced Technology Program to genetically re-engineer cotton, making its fibers more like polyester. Technology subsidies to corporations are sold using technobabble to camouflage unjustifiable investments, which typically fall into four categories:",1,0.3309,0.6691

"Why a Strong Economy Sends Markets Reeling; Wall Street Investors Play By Different Rules, Experts Say. Once again yesterday Wall Street investors ran for cover on the news that things were looking up for American workers and consumers. Even with the stock markets closed and many traders off for the Easter weekend, bond prices fell sharply, setting the stage for stocks to follow suit when the markets reopen on Monday.</br></br>This disconnect between the markets and the economy is rooted in the perennial fear that strong economic growth will lead to inflation and higher interest rates, the things investors fear most.</br></br>""The fundamentals of the markets these days are not the inflation rate or the unemployment rate but the underlying architecture of speculation,"" said Jim Grant, editor of a widely read newsletter on interest rates.</br></br>The rising employment and brisk growth that the economy has generated since last summer already was reflected in the strong run-up in stock and bond prices through last year. What the markets may be doing now is reflecting a widely held view that inflation and interest rates will be higher, and economic growth will be slower, in 1995.</br></br>Pessimists see an economy that has nearly reached full employment, where auto plants are running at full capacity and whose prices for raw commodities are beginning to rise. By traditional standards, these are indications that wages and prices soon will begin to climb, pulling with them interest rates.

"Time Off for Urgent Family Matters; More Companies Are Offering Extended Leave to Boost Morale and Loyalty. Todd Buchwald took a week off after each of his two sons was born. But when he and his wife were about to have their third child, in September 2001, Buchwald decided he wanted more time to spend with the boys and the new baby.</br></br>So the high-level lawyer with the State Department finally asked the decision-makers at his job if he could take off six months, using a combination of unpaid leave, vacation time and sick time permitted under the Family and Medical Leave Act. His bosses' answer was a simple yes. ""I work very hard, and I think the fact that I asked for it, people must have perceived it was very important to me,"" he said.</br></br>Many companies and organizations are beginning to take extended leaves, both paid and unpaid, seriously. Giving a valued employee such as Buchwald a long leave promotes worker retention, morale and loyalty. And in today's economy, employees may have a better chance than in previous years to get that leave because companies providing a career break can cut back on costs. Granted, leaves can mean more work for the other employees, as we've discussed recently in this space. But those who fill in will often get a turn, too. Sometimes, the decision to give grant leave comes down to whether someone can be found to cover the work.</br></br>As a lawyer in the legal adviser's office in political military affairs at the State Department, Buchwald delayed his leave when his daughter, Elizabeth, was born just days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ""Beyond how horrible [Sept. 11] was, it was also an incredibly intense time at the State Department. If 9/11 hadn't happened, I would have gone on leave earlier,"" he said.</br></br>Instead, he waited until January to take his six months off to bond with his infant daughter between escorting his sons to school and coaching Little League. His colleagues filled in for him and made him feel fine about taking a break. ""People in the office were incredibly supportive,"" he said.

"Apple Rolls the Dice With Intel Chips. No, there aren't ""Intel Inside"" stickers on Apple's new Intel- powered iMac desktops and MacBook Pro laptops, introduced this week at the Macworld Conference & Expo here. The distinctive Intel chime that ends almost every PC manufacturer's ad does not emanate from the speakers of these new machines, either.</br></br>Even from up close, it can be difficult to tell Apple's new Intel- based iMac and MacBook Pro from their PowerPC predecessors -- the iMac, in particular. With it powered off, the only easy way to distinguish it from the iMac G5 is a DVI digital-video port that takes the place of an analog VGA connector on the old model.</br></br>But with the MacBook Pro (go ahead and keep calling it a PowerBook; we probably will, too), Apple is trying out several new ideas in laptop design and taking one big gamble. It has the same built-in iSight webcam, remote control and Front Row media-viewing software as the iMac and trades in the old PowerBook's PC Card slot for a newfangled ""Express Card"" slot -- but it doesn't include a modem. You can buy a $49 external modem, or at some point, you may be able to pop a modem into that Express Card slot.</br></br>I haven't used a modem much in the past few years, but when I've needed to, it's always been on my laptop -- shocking as it is in a country that calls itself part of the First World, there are some places in the United States without Wi-Fi broadband. Apple is taking a risk here, and for minimal gain -- it's not like there isn't room on the laptop's flanks for a modem port.</br></br>Next to where you might expect to find such a thing, Apple has stashed one other new trick, a MagSafe power connector. Instead of requiring you to insert a plug into a socket, this flat, recessed surface uses a magnet to hold the power cable firmly in place while still allowing it to break away cleanly if the power cord gets jerked unexpectedly -- say, when I trip over it for the fifth time in a day.",0,0.6403,0.3597

WASHINGTON -- Economic growth was slightly stronger during the third quarter than previously estimated, the Commerce Department reported.</br></br>But the upward revision of 0.1 percentage point in gross domestic product -- to a 4.0% annual rate -- was largely brushed aside by economists, who said it was too insignificant to prompt a rethinking of their predictions for growth.</br></br>Many are forecasting continued strong growth through the beginning of next year, followed by a slowing in the economy as the effects of higher interest rates start to kick in.</br></br>Additional evidence of recent economic momentum came from a separate Commerce Department report yesterday on the growth in third-quarter corporate profits: Although the figure was revised downward 0.3 percentage point to show a 2.5% increase, the updated figure was still strong enough to suggest healthy business activity.</br></br>The slight upward revision in GDP, which measures all goods and services produced in the U.S., primarily reflected more spending by foreign travelers in this country.

"An Economy of Liars; When government and business collude, it's called crony capitalism. Expect more of this from the financial reforms contemplated in Washington.. Free markets depend on truth telling. Prices must reflect the valuations of consumers; interest rates must be reliable guides to entrepreneurs allocating capital across time; and a firm's accounts must reflect the true value of the business. Rather than truth telling, we are becoming an economy of liars. The cause is straightforward: crony capitalism.</br></br>Thomas Carlyle, the 19th century Victorian essayist, unflatteringly described classical liberalism as ""anarchy plus a constable."" As a romanticist, Carlyle hated the system--but described it accurately.</br></br>Classical liberals, whose modern counterparts are libertarians and small-government conservatives, believed that the state's duties should be limited (1) to provide for the national defense; (2) to protect persons and property against force and fraud; and (3) to provide public goods that markets cannot. That conception of government and its duties was articulated by the Declaration of Independence and embodied in the U.S. Constitution.</br></br>Modern liberals have greatly expanded the list of government functions, but, aside from totalitarian regimes, I know of no modern political movement that has shortened it. While protecting citizens against force, both at home and abroad, is the government's most basic function, protecting them against fraud is closely allied. By the use of force, a thief takes by arms what is not rightfully his; he who commits fraud takes secretly what is not rightfully his. It is the difference between a robber stealing brazenly on the street and a burglar stealing by stealth at night. The result is the same: the loss of property by its owner and the disordering of civil society. And government has failed miserably to perform this basic function.</br></br>Why has this happened? Financial services regulators failed to enforce laws and regulations against fraud. Bernie Madoff is the paradigmatic case and the Securities and Exchange Commission the paradigmatic failed regulator. Fraud is famously difficult to uncover, but as we now know, not Madoff's. The SEC chose to ignore the evidence brought to its attention. Banking regulators allowed a kind of mortgage dubbed ""liar loans"" to flourish. And so on.",0,1.0,0.0

"Why Borrowers May Not Benefit From Rate Cut; Many Loans Are Now Tied To Benchmark That Remains High Despite Fed's Moves. Not all borrowers are benefiting from the Fed's moves to cut interest rates. The problem: Loans that are tied to a variety of interest-rate benchmarks -- some of which aren't necessarily moving in lockstep with Fed action.</br></br>Yesterday, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25% -- the central bank's third rate cut since mid-September -- to help ease the credit crunch and reduce the economy's chances of falling into a recession. The moves have helped some borrowers who have seen interest rates on their credit cards and home-equity lines of credit fall. Interest rates on many fixed-rate mortgages also have dropped amid a decline in Treasury yields as investors sought out safe investments.</br></br>But rates remain stubbornly high on other loans, including student debt and many adjustable-rate loans made to the same type of subprime borrowers whose troubles are now reverberating throughout the global financial system. These rates remain high because many of these loans are tied to the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and not to more conventional interest-rate benchmarks such as Treasurys or banks' prime rate.</br></br>Libor, which is an interest rate banks charge on loans to each other, normally tracks the federal-funds rate closely. But continuing worries over the credit crisis have kept Libor unusually high -- partly because banks are reluctant to lend to one another -- even as other short-term interest rates have fallen in recent months. The U.S. dollar three-month Libor yesterday was 5.11%, down from 5.36% in late June. Over the same period, three-month Treasury bill yields have fallen much more steeply, to 2.95% from 4.8%. ""The Libor spread is screaming that there is a big, big stress point in the banking system,"" says James Bianco, president of Bianco Research LLC, a market-research firm in Chicago.</br></br>Borrowers may need to read the fine print of their loan agreement or contact their lender to know what benchmark their loan is tied to. The biggest impact is likely to be felt among borrowers with ARMs that are about to reset. ""If you have a Libor-indexed ARM and you're facing a reset, that's going to be very disadvantageous because of the divergence between the Libor and Treasury yields,"" says Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com.",1,0.32230000000000003,0.6777
"Why Japan Could Take a Fall; Like Us, They're Mortgaging Their Future With Reckless Spending. Japan is America's number-one student. Unfortunately the lesson that it has been learning in recent years is a bad one: how to grow rich through greed.</br></br>As a result, the current Japanese prosperity, which pushed the Tokyo stock market to new highs last week, is, like the current United States prosperity, built upon a rickety foundation. In Japan that foundation is propped up by a superheated real estate market. In the United States the prop is a set of government policies that have made the dollar cheap and interest rates high. These supports could easily collapse with a thud heard from Bangkok to Bangor.</br></br>Despite the odds and the economists' predictions, the eight years of the Reagan administration have seen unprecedented economic growth in the free world. That prosperity, however, led by Japan and the United States, has been brought about largely by borrowing from the future. Greed, based on unrealistic expectations of the durability of short-term results, has acquired a momentum far beyond our ability to control it rationally. Government, corporations and individuals in both countries have collateralized their future, and borrowed against it, to generate cash to enjoy now.</br></br>The borrowing phenomenon is not, of course, new to the western world, but the extent and level of the credit society are unprecedented. Both the United States and Japan now spend approximately one-quarter of their government revenue just to pay the interest on their deficit-financing securities.</br></br>America's prodigality has been the subject of much learned as well as popular discussion. Less well understood, however, is the degree to which Japan has become similarly infected.

It is preposterous to suggest that legalizing drugs will in any way mitigate the havoc wreaked by the crime, decreased productivity, failed education, impaired national defense, addiction and death associated with drug abuse.</br></br>Most Americans are law abiding. Laws are a society's way of codifying what the majority considers correct and incorrect behavior. Millions of us were brought up to believe that certain activities, enticing though they may seem, should not be engaged in because our society considers them unacceptable.

"Gearing Down for a Computer Comeback --- Modest Upturn Is Seen On Cost-Cutting Drive. The computer industry, considerably leaner a year after its worst slump, appears poised for a modest comeback.</br></br>But unlike past rebounds in the highly volatile business, this one promises to be uneven and prompted mostly by cost cutting instead of rejuvenated sales. Gone, for now at least, are the huge annual sales increases that led many companies to overbuild capacity amid expectations of continued heavy growth. And while some major players -- including Digital Equipment Corp., NCR Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. -- are reporting improved earnings and others are predicting them for later this year, the salad days are over.</br></br>Last year's blood bath led to fundamental changes that will be reflected in some balance sheets. Thousands of workers were fired, plants were closed and inventories were slashed.

"Deals & Deal Makers: J.P. Morgan Chase Unit Seeks Investors For a $13 Billion Private-Equity Fund. J.P.

Chase's prospective contribution is believed to be the biggest sum ever contributed to a single private-equity fund by any individual organization.</br></br>If the bank is successful in raising the money, the new fund, dubbed the Chase Capital Global 2001 Fund LP, would dwarf not only the growing multitude of venture-capital funds with $1 billion to $2 billion ready to invest but even Thomas Lee's just-raised $6.1 billion buyout fund, now the largest private-equity fund.

"Deflation Is Nothing to Fear. The spread of the Asian contagion to Russia and possibly Latin America is raising the specter of deflation, which to many conjures up images of the bread lines and apple sellers of the 1930s. Back then, U.S. wholesale prices dropped 32% as demand nose-dived in the face of bankruptcies, widespread unemployment and massive pay cuts.</br></br>Today we have financial crises aplenty in Asia, but they are unlikely to spread to the West. In the U.S., the long series of sectoral financial problems -- ranging from the farm-belt collapse in the early 1980s to difficulties related to the defense cutbacks of the early 1990s -- are behind us. Demand will probably not collapse in the West, even though there are some demand-reducing deflationary forces at work in the world. The Cold War is over, and the history of U.S. inflation is the history of wars. Since 1749, prices have risen at double-digit annual rates in wartime, but have fallen by more than 1% a year on average in peacetime. This isn't surprising, since the government is the only economic sector with enough financial credibility to outspend its revenues vastly and create excess demand for any length of time.</br></br>Wars on poverty are similarly inflationary, but the passage of welfare reform suggests that Washington is serious about cutting nondefense spending. Government spending in Europe is hemmed in by the Maastricht requirements for deficits and debts. And despite eight years of a deflationary depression, Japan remains unwilling to enact major tax cuts for fear of the budgetary consequences.</br></br>These are not the only deflationary forces at work. The Federal Reserve and other central banks continue to fight yesterday's war against inflation. Productivity-enhancing and cost-cutting restructuring prevails in this country and is spreading to Europe and Japan. Deregulation is bringing prices down. The continuing strength of the U.S. dollar encourages imports at lower costs, thereby forcing domestic competitors to reduce their selling prices.</br></br>Even more significant are deflationary forces that increase supply. Global sourcing is mushrooming low-cost supplies, and not just of goods. Software engineers in India are working for U.S. firms at 20% of what Americans cost. The shift in both Russia and especially China from the command economy model to unbridled, buccaneer capitalism is also creating huge new sources of supply. The collapsed Asian economies, including Japan, desperately want to increase exports to employ their citizens and earn hard currency to service their huge foreign debts. Include booming high-tech industries, and global supplies of almost everything will surge while prices will necessarily fall.",0,1.0,0.0
"Fannie Mae Narrows Duration Gap --- Mortgage Concern Achieves Better Match of Assets And Liabilities It Owns. NEW YORK -- To the relief of some bond investors, Fannie Mae's exposure to interest-rate volatility fell significantly last month, suggesting it has made more progress in correcting a big mismatch between its assets and liabilities.</br></br>Fannie Mae, a publicly traded government-sponsored enterprise, said its duration gap -- a measure of how well cash flows from assets and liabilities match up -- narrowed during October to negative six months from negative 10 months for September and negative 14 months for August. Duration measures how sensitive bonds are to moves in interest rates. A negative duration gap suggests cash flow from Fannie Mae's assets will drop more quickly than the stream of payments it owes its debtholders.</br></br>August's figure of negative 14 months was the largest gap ever and prompted concerns among investors about Fannie Mae's ability to meet its obligations. It also sparked a rally in the Treasury market, as investors anticipated Fannie Mae would need to buy a large amount of Treasurys to cover its gap.</br></br>Although Fannie Mae still had a gap for October, the figure fell just within its target range. Spokeswoman Janis Smith declined to say specifically how Fannie Mae narrowed the gap, citing a policy of not commenting on specific market activity. But, she said, ""our mortgage commitments, mortgage purchases, hedging with swaps and swaptions [options on swaps], and callable securities are all vehicles we used to manage the duration gap.""</br></br>People in the market said Fannie Mae aggressively bought mortgage securities to adjust its portfolio duration. By buying mortgages, Fannie Mae took cash flows of faster prepaying mortgages and reinvested it in newer, lower coupon mortgages. The newer mortgages, which carry lower rates, aren't likely to be refinanced soon, and that helped narrow the duration gap.",0,1.0,0.0
"Consumer Prices Didn't Increase At All in January --- Situation Hasn't Occurred In Over Four Years; Inflation Is Seen Tamed. WASHINGTON -- Overall consumer prices didn't increase at all in January, according to the Labor Department, some thing that hasn't happened in more than four years.</br></br>Analysts said the figures show, yet again, that inflation is well under control despite a noticeably improving economy.</br></br>Last month's steady prices followed a moderate increase in December, when prices were 0.2% above November's. The bitterly cold weather didn't damage crops enough to force up prices, as the cost of food declined last month. Clothing, trans portation and energy prices declined as well, while housing prices moderated. Medical-care and entertainment prices both rose 0.3%, the same as they did in December. The so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, was up only 0.1%, com pared with a 0.2% rise in December.</br></br>January's consumer price report marks the first in which the Labor Department has used new seasonal adjustments to help diminish the report's tendency to show larger price increases at the beginning of the year and smaller ones at the end.</br></br>For that reason, analysts were unsure how much credence to put into the January price figures.

"Higher Taxes Unlikely to Hurt Recovery --- Economists See Minor Impact on Consumer Spending. Just how much will the Clinton tax increase on the most well-off Americans hurt the economic recovery?</br></br>Although the tax rise will take some zest out of consumer spending, mainstream economists say it poses no serious threat to the recovery. They say that unlike former President Bush's tax increases, which hit a slowing economy, President Clinton's tax rise comes during an expansion. The added taxes on the wealthy, they say, will damp things, but at a time when the economy can absorb the setback.</br></br>A dissenting view comes from supply-side economists, who argue the tax on the rich will lead to lower investment and productivity, trends that, over time, would make the U.S. less competitive.</br></br>The tax rise didn't pass Congress until August, but the income-tax increases are retroactive to Jan. 1, 1993; the increases apply to couples with taxable income over $140,000, after deductions, and individuals with income over $115,000. Taking account of all the income and other tax increases, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that families making more than $200,000 annually will be socked with an average of 17.4% more in taxes, or $24,000. The fear is that when wealthy people sit down to do their taxes next year, they will be shocked to find out how much they owe and suddenly stop spending -- hurting a recovery that's finally gaining momentum.</br></br>""The April tax payment date may have a shock effect,"" warns Kurt Karl, chief economist for WEFA Group in suburban Philadelphia.

"Stock Market Quarterly Review -- Essay: Feel-Good Factor Might Float Away; Renewed Doubts Include the Dollar, Recovery's Strength, Interest Rates and Stock Valuations.

There are always tradeoffs and harm from price controls, and quantitative easing has been the most ambitious and far-reaching price-control policy ever attempted. QE's massive bond purchases and money creation eroded market confidence and sidelined capital for many who attributed a phony recovery and an artificial economy to QE. Mohammed El Erian, the CEO of Pimco, the world's largest bond fund manager, points out that Fed creation of money in $4 trillion of QE bond purchases added a mere quarter of 1% (0.25%) to GDP growth -- a lousy tradeoff considering the heightened risks of inflation from QE money expansion and the risks of Fed insolvency from the attendant precipitous fall in bond prices.</br></br>In spite of the rise in asset prices of stocks and real estate from QE policies, it may turn out that far less new wealth was actually created if those prices deflate when QE liquidity is withdrawn.</br></br>QE has been accompanied by the worst post-recession recovery on record since the Great Depression in terms of GDP growth and a 40-year low in the labor-force participation rate.

The stock market sidestepped into the new year and promptly fell about 250 points as of Friday's close.

"The Great Pretender. The passage of President Clinton's budget plan inspires one overriding emotion: relief. The biggest casualty of this dreary debate, conducted with hype on both sides, has been public understanding. The whole process has perpetuated the myth that the budget serves mainly as a tool to manage the economy. Our debates are backward. They focus on the budget's immediate economic effects and ignore the broader issue: defining the scope of government - and finding the best ways of paying for it.</br></br>The budget package is better than nothing, because it makes a small start at controlling the government's mushrooming debt. But you should be skeptical of all claims, pro and con, concerning the instant economic impact. Ours is a $6 trillion economy. Modest changes in government spending or taxes - and these changes are modest - don't mechanically determine its behavior. Too many other things matter. Remember that the deficit reduction of $496 billion occurs over five years, when the economy's estimated output will total slightly more than $36 trillion.</br></br>The point is not that the budget has no economic consequences; it is that the important consequences tend to be gradual and cumulative, as opposed to sudden jolts that make (or break) the business cycle. Yet, the politics of the budget are just the opposite. It will be judged on whether the recovery continues and how strong it becomes. Clinton and the congressional Republicans have each staked their political futures on something over which they have little, if any, control.</br></br>Clinton calls the budget ""my plan for economic recovery"" and says that it has already reduced interest rates on mortgages and bonds. Well, maybe there's been a small effect. But the main reason rates have dropped is the decline of inflation that began long before Clinton's election. Investors accept lower interest rates, because the value of their money isn't eroding so rapidly. It's the Republicans, though, who really ought to worry. Recoveries, once begun, gather momentum. If this one does, gradually creating new jobs with low inflation, Clinton will boast, ""My plan worked - and not one Republican voted for it.""</br></br>What will they say then? Republicans seem to expect that the recovery will stumble on what Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole calls ""the largest tax increase in world history."" Dole must have amnesia. In 1982, when he was majority leader, Congress passed legislation raising taxes $214 billion over five years. Adjusted for inflation, that's larger than the five-year tax increase in Clinton's budget ($240 billion). Guess what? The economy didn't collapse. By 1987 it had created nearly 13 million new jobs.",0,0.7107,0.2893
"Targeted Ways To Beat Inflation. NEW YORK -- With inflation fears on the rise, investors may want to make sure their target-date funds' inflation-fighting strategies match their own.</br></br>Managers of these funds, typically funds of funds that are a popular tool for retirement planning, adopt varying strategies for protecting investors from inflation and differ on just how much protection is required.</br></br>""A lot of these firms are still sort of struggling with how to do it,"" says Josh Charlson, a senior mutual-fund analyst at Morningstar Inc.

"The Biggest Boom Ever. We are about to rewrite history. Unless a recession begins in the next few days, this boom will soon become the longest in the American experience. In February, it will have lasted 107 months. The current record is 106 months between February 1961 and December 1969, according to the dating of business cycles by the National Bureau of Economic Research. By and large, Americans are behaving as if recessions are a relic of the past, even though everyone must realize that the boom will end someday--and might end badly.</br></br>As with all records, people will celebrate and assert bragging rights. President Clinton always claims credit and will almost certainly repeat the claims in tomorrow's State of the Union. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is idolized for his presumed role. The murkier truth is that the boom's causes remain obscure and, to the extent they can be identified, reflect a protracted and largely nonpolitical process.</br></br>Low inflation has been the critical catalyst. In the past, rising inflation has doomed expansions through higher interest rates, increased labor costs and squeezed profits. Consumer spending, housing construction and business investment all suffered. Yet, inflation now remains tame. By various measures, it's running between 1 percent and slightly more than 2 percent a year. This is lower than in 1990 (between 4 percent and 6 percent by the same measures) and defies the conventional tendency of inflation to worsen as the economy ""heats up."" * The Fed: Paul Volcker, chairman of the Fed between 1979 and 1987, crushed inflationary expectations. In the 1960s and 1970s, these had become ingrained. Companies raised prices because they expected customers would pay. Workers expected pay raises to compensate for higher prices--and then some. The Fed blessed the process by creating more money. Its permissive policies rested on the prevailing--but faulty--theory that a bit of inflation aided economic growth. By 1980 inflation had reached double digits. Volcker tightened money, increased interest rates and caused a savage recession. In 1982 unemployment neared 11 percent. Though brutal, the downturn stifled wage and price increases. By 1983 inflation was 4 percent. President Reagan sanctioned Volcker's policy by muting criticism. Since then, Greenspan's Fed has pursued ""price stability"" and has raised interest rates (as in 1994) to prevent inflation's upward creep. Presidents Bush and Clinton have emulated Reagan's self- restraint.</br></br>* Better Management: Through the 1970s, corporate managers were rarely fired. Their job tenure rivaled university professors'. In the 1980s, things changed. Managers became vulnerable to job loss for many reasons: the recession; foreign competition; deregulation in the airline, trucking and communications industries; ""hostile"" corporate takeovers; the growth of new discounters (Wal-Mart, Home Depot). Self- preservation made managers more ruthless. They cut costs to raise profits. Old plants were shut. Layoffs and ""downsizings"" became common. Again, the immediate consequences were often cruel and (as with Volcker's recession) widely deplored. But the lasting effect was less inflationary behavior.</br></br>* New Technology: As everyone knows, business investment in computers and communications has exploded. The presumption is that these investments enable companies to do things faster and cheaper-- they raise ""productivity."" Firms can minimize unneeded inventories or speed the processing of customer orders. Higher productivity can be magical. If a company improves productivity 3 percent, it can raise wages 3 percent without increasing prices or sacrificing profits. And productivity has improved. In recent years, it's approached 3 percent a year, up from 1.6 percent in the 1980s.",1,0.3407,0.6593

"`Reflation' Comes Into Focus as U.S. Struggles to Battle Deflation. INFLATION. DEFLATION. Disinflation. The economic lexicon is garbled with so many 'flations these days, it's getting a little hard to make sense of them all. During the 1970s, '80s and '90s, Washington policy makers waged a persistent battle against inflation, broadly defined as rising consumer prices. But for most of this year, as the inflation rate has fallen closer to zero, economists began to worry about the opposite trend -- the possibility that the U.S. could face Japan-style deflation, or falling consumer prices.</br></br>As we enter 2003, here comes a new watchword: reflation. The term refers to government efforts to pump up -- or reflate -- an economy that is stuck in a slump by flooding that economy with money. Essentially, reflation is the intentional effort by governments to ward off deflation by boosting demand and underpinning prices. Though it isn't quite the same as inflation, reflation can spark inflation problems if policy makers go too far.</br></br>The term is popping up often. In a recent report titled ""The Reflation Trade,"" Morgan Stanley Co. chief economist Stephen Roach argued that policy makers are now in a ""full-scale frontal assault on the perils of deflation."" That has made him more bullish on the stock market in the months ahead. James Grant, in his twice-monthly newsletter, Grant's Interest Rate Observer, writes about a ""global reflation program"" being led by the U.S. and spreading world-wide. That, he said, explains why prices for gold -- a hedge against inflation and his favorite investment -- are on the rise.</br></br>SOME ECONOMISTS who have been beating deflation drums are doing an about-face. ""There has been an important shift. The financial community is talking more about reflation . . . it is the thing to watch in 2003,"" says Paul McCulley, chief economist at Pacific Investment Management Co., the California bond-fund manager that recently advised clients that government-bond yields will rise as result of today's reflation tilt.</br></br>Behind the reflation focus is blunt talk by Federal Reserve officials. Earlier this month, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told economists in New York that while deflation is only a remote possibility, the central bank is ""extraordinarily sensitive"" to the potential perils associated with it and is prepared to forestall it if the economy moves further in that direction. In November, Fed governor Ben Bernanke laid out a series of unusual steps the Fed could take to get out of Japan-style deflation if it did happen -- such as lending more aggressively to banks to drive down private borrowing costs or buying foreign government bonds, which could weaken the dollar and boost exports.",1,0.0,1.0

"$30 Billion Question. For Democrats, $30 billion seems to be the magic number.</br></br>It's the amount Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both say is needed to stimulate the economy out of its doldrums. (Coincidently, it was the financial backing that the Federal Reserve originally offered for the Bear Stearns deal, before trimming it by $1 billion.) Sen. Obama laid out his economic plan today, and it helped sharpen policy differences between the two Democratic rivals, as well as Republican candidate John McCain. The stimulus prescription, it seems, is the political divider. Of course, both parties have already voted through a much larger $152 billion stimulus plan. That measure was designed to get people spending and businesses investing, however. The monies the two Democrats suggest adding to the pot would go toward battling the fallout from the housing crunch. Sen. Clinton's $30 billion would mostly go to help states and cities buy foreclosed properties. Mr. Obama has the same idea, but he would dedicate $10 billion of his stimulus to helping states head off cuts in services as tax revenues decline and to expanding unemployment insurance.</br></br>On the Republican side, Sen. McCain has sworn off using government money for bailouts, although he backed the Bear Stearns deal as a fix to ""systemic financial problems."" He also doesn't approve lowering the down-payment requirements for Federal Housing Authority-backed loans as a way to help low-income homeowners. On the contrary, he wants to raise them. Sens. Obama and Clinton can agree on very little these days, but they have united in dismissing Sen. McCain's policy as fiddling while Rome burns. Sen. Clinton revived her ""3a.m. phone call"" image that she had used in an attack ad on Sen. Obama, and applied it to Sen. McCain: ""The phone is ringing, and he would just let it ring and ring."" In his speech, Mr. Obama said Sen. McCain's plan ""amounts to little more than watching this crisis happen."" Sen. McCain struck back in a statement before Sen. Obama's speech had even ended. ""There is a tendency for liberals to seek big government programs that sock it to American taxpayers while failing to solve the very real problems we face,"" he said. Sen. McCain agrees with his opponents in some areas. Like them, he thinks mortgage companies should do more to help cash-strapped but creditworthy borrowers with their loans.</br></br>---</br></br>Oil Pipeline Struck in Iraq",0,0.6583,0.3417

"Democrats And the Politics Of Recession. It is now common to hear the current economic downturn described as the worst since the Great Depression. Yet as we approach the second election since this downturn began, it is clear that the politics of the two could not be more dissimilar. Three generations ago, Democrats rode the Depression to congressional gains in four straight elections. They more than doubled their House and Senate totals between 1929 and 1937. If current polls are accurate, today's Democrats are about to see their winning streak end at two elections. Why?</br></br>Today's Democrats face economic variables far less daunting than those of their 1930s predecessors. Unemployment had been 3.2% in 1929. By 1933, when FDR took office, it was 24.9%. It fell, but not far. Over FDR's first term, unemployment averaged 18.6%. Even by 1940, as FDR sought his third term -- and despite direct intervention through programs like the Work Projects Administration (WPA) and the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) -- it was still 14.6%. Today's 9.6% rate is about half of FDR's first-term average.</br></br>The same comparative advantage holds true for economic growth. During the Depression, the economy shrank for four straight years following the 1929 stock market crash. This included FDR's first year in office. In real terms, the economy did not regain its 1929 level until 1936, and the Depression did not end until World War II's massive mobilization. Within those dozen years, FDR also endured his own ""double dip,"" dubbed the ""Roosevelt recession,"" in 1938. This reality hardly reflects the simplified conventional wisdom that the New Deal quickly ended the Depression.</br></br>If today's experts are correct and the recession has already ended, President Obama's economic record compares very favorably to FDR's. Since the third quarter of 2009, his first year in office, the economy has grown -- hardly robustly, but progress nonetheless.</br></br>On taxes too, Mr. Obama holds an advantage over FDR. Between 1932 and 1936, revenue collected by the government doubled, rising to $3.9 billion from $1.9 billion. At their 1938 peak, federal receipts were $6.8 billion -- three-and-a-half times 1932's level. These increases were no accident. FDR sought, and got, significantly higher taxes.",0,0.6822,0.3178
"Leading the News: Movie Industry Saw Ticket Sales Climb 11% in Year. Movie-ticket sales in the U.S. totaled about $9.3 billion last year, up at least 11% from 2001, thanks to hits such as ""Spider-Man,"" ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" and 20 other movies that each generated more than $100 million at the box office.</br></br>While Hollywood is crowing it had another ""record"" year, admissions rose a more modest 8% when adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Moreover, the higher ticket sales and attendance figures were due to the proliferation of expensively promoted ""franchise"" movies and sequels, masking what otherwise would have been a bleak year for most studios.</br></br>The estimated 11% increase in ticket sales comes from Exhibitor Relations Co., a closely held firm that analyzes and distributes box-office data it receives from the studios.</br></br>The explosion in sales of digital videodiscs during 2002 will help mitigate any miscalculations the studios made in coming up with more original movies. DVD sales increased 50% to $8.1 billion in 2002, according to Adams Media Research, as consumers showed a willingness to buy low-price discs at mass retailers rather than rent movies. With the new format gaining favor, sales of VHS format videos, which peaked in 1996 at $6 billion, fell to $4.3 billion.</br></br>The rise in ticket sales and attendance also was helped by theater operators increasingly packing 15-plus-screen cinemas with multiple showings of the same movie on opening weekend.

"CPI at 7%? Bet Your Reserve Dollar. The ""surprise"" jump in producer and consumer price inflation is not a surprise when you understand the political and economic logic of using one nation's domestic currency -- the U.S. dollar -- as international money. Domestically oriented analysts have been fooled because U.S. inflation responds to the world-wide supply of dollars, not just those in the U.S.</br></br>The Bush administration fervently hopes the latest figures are just an aberration. Such arguments must be used with caution. (The Carter administration used to tell us that if you took away food, energy and housing, the underlying rate of inflation was only 9%.) True, the price of crude oil jumped more than $5 a barrel from November to January. But analysts knew what oil prices were, and they were still surprised. Moreover, oil prices fell sharply for most of 1988 without a fall in the inflation rate. Everything points to a broader acceleration of inflation.</br></br>While some point to rising wages or energy costs, the main cause of the current inflation is the past expansion of what my forecasting firm calls the ""world dollar base"" -- the stock of high-powered money (currency plus bank reserves) in the U.S., plus the dollars held by foreign central banks. The world dollar base is key because the world operates on a kind of ""dollar standard."" Other currencies are no longer pegged to the dollar. But most currencies, including the Japanese yen and West German mark, are backed with dollars, as currencies once were backed by gold reserves. The dollar shared this role with gold under the Bretton Woods monetary system of 1944-71. But since 1971, the dollar has been the unchallenged ""reserve currency,"" even with somewhat greater use of the yen and the mark by small countries.</br></br>This change had an important, but overlooked, consequence for the U.S. ""twin deficits"": budget and trade. Under the dollar standard -- as under a gold standard -- the rest of the world must consume and invest less than its income in order to acquire reserves (sought for reasons I shall note). In economic jargon, this is called running an overall ""balance-of-payments surplus."" It's analogous to the fact that to put more cash in your wallet, you must pay out less than you earn, beg or borrow.</br></br>But it's different for the reserve-currency country. If other countries increase their dollar reserves, the U.S. must pay out more than it receives -- run a chronic ""balance-of-payments deficit."" To get a rough idea of the difference, imagine that everyone carried your personal checks around in his wallet instead of money. You wouldn't need to carry any cash -- just your checkbook. And with so many of your checks floating around permanently uncashed, you would always have a fat checking-account balance at your disposal, far beyond what you had saved.",0,1.0,0.0

"Economy Posts Higher Growth Than Estimated --- Fourth-Quarter GNP Rose At 4.9% Rate; Revision In Trade Deficit Cited. WASHINGTON -- The economy grew at a strong 4.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year, the Commerce Department said, rather than the 3.9% rate estimated by the agency last month.</br></br>The large revision in the inflation-adjusted gross national product, the nation's total output of goods and services, was due principally to an unexpected reduction in December's trade deficit from the earlier estimate. For its earlier GNP report, the department had estimated that the December trade deficit would approach $10 billion, but in fact the deficit, as reported three weeks ago, was $8.2 billion. The deficit is a negative factor in calculating the GNP.</br></br>Most analysts believe the easing in the trade deficit is temporary, resulting from the economy's slowdown in the third quarter. They expect the rapid growth of the economy in the fourth quarter, combined with the continued strength of the dollar, to cause the deficit to get even larger next year.</br></br>The economy grew at a sluggish 1.6% rate in the third quarter.

"How Much Is Too Much?; Fed Looks for Its Comfort Zone in Debate Over Inflation. Behind the closed doors of the Federal Reserve's marble temple on Constitution Avenue, a fervent debate is underway this week. The subject might seem, at first glance, to reflect minor differences of opinion.</br></br>Should the Fed explicitly tell the public what level of inflation it wants to achieve? And if so, should that goal be in the 1 to 2 percent range, or ""comfort zone,"" expressed by many central bankers in recent years, or should the upper limit be raised to as high as 3 percent?</br></br>Close as those numbers may sound, the implications for every American family are substantial. If the Fed enforces a low- inflation goal vs. one that is slightly higher, consider what a pair of pants or a loaf of bread would cost a decade from now, assuming they track the overall inflation rate.</br></br>If inflation runs a modest 1.5 percent a year, typical of the level in the late 1990s, a $70 pair of pants would cost $81.24 in 10 years and a $2.79 loaf of bread would cost $3.24.

"Economy Surged 4.2% In Second Quarter; Clinton Takes Credit for Gains.

"As Food Prices Rise, Fed Keeps a Watchful Eye; Central Bank Officials Sometimes Look Past Food-Cost Increases. U.S. food prices are on the rise, raising a sensitive question: When the cost of a hamburger patty soars, does it count as inflation?</br></br>It does to everyone who eats and especially poorer Americans, whose food costs absorb a larger portion of their income. But central bankers take a more nuanced view. They sometimes look past food-price increases that appear temporary or isolated while trying to control broad and long-term inflation trends, not blips that might soon reverse.</br></br>The Federal Reserve faces an especially important challenge now as it mulls the long-standing dilemma of what to make of the price of a pork chop.</br></br>As Fed officials debate when to start raising short-term interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating and causing inflation, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen has signaled she wants to take her time.</br></br>Broad measures of inflation have been running below the Fed's 2% target for more than two years, but show signs of picking up.

"A Comeback for `Turnaround' Funds? --- Analysts Believe Recovery Is Near. NEW YORK -- Bull market? What bull market?</br></br>That is what investors in many of the ""turnaround"" mutual funds must be wondering. Although these funds don't always invest in companies mired in bankruptcy court, they make their money the same way the classic vulture funds do -- by dabbling in beaten-up securities that most other investors have left for dead.</br></br>The funds have performed miserably for some time. They trailed the market badly in 1989 and 1990. And with a few notable exceptions, 1991 has so far been another woeful year.</br></br>But with many investors now betting on the end of the recession, fund managers and fund analysts reckon better times may lie ahead for turnaround mutual funds.</br></br>""Nobody has focused on this area for the last year and half, with good reason,"" says Robert Martorelli, manager of the Merrill Lynch Phoenix Fund.

"Beefsteak and the Cost of Living. The cost of living figures for February are a severe blow to the administration and its political standing. More broadly, they are a severe blow to the country generally in its struggle with inflation. The upward creep of prices is proving less manageable than most Americans had expected. The increase, seasonally adjusted, was 0.2 per cent in November, the month when the freeze ended on wages and prices. It was 0.4 per cent in December, 0.3 per cent in January, and now we learn that it was 0.5 per cent last month. The explanation that we are experiencing merely a transient ÛÏbulgeÛ following The freeze has worn very thin.</br></br>About three-fourths of the February increase was generated by higher food prices, a particularly sensitive matter for politicians, and more than two-thirds of the increase in food prices was owed to the cost of meat. Mr. Grayson, the chairman of the Price Commission, has called hearings in April to inquire into meat prices. He is likely to discover that one explanation of the mystery lies no farther away than the White House, where President Nixon has been urging his Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Butz, to keep farm income up while he simultaneously urges Mr. Grayson to keep prices d6wn.</br></br>The Grayson hearings will doubtless also be told what agricultural economists have been saying very clearly, and what Congressman RosenthalÛªs hearings for the Democratic Study Group learned last week. Meat pricing is a classic example of the workings of supply and demand, with no very satisfactory solution in sight. The national system of controls is now moving from the broad, confident generalizations of last fall to the minute, skull-splitting particulars of administration and enforcement. The meat business is a splendid example of the difficulty.</br></br>Americans like red meat, and are eating more of it than ever. Consumption of beef in this country rose from 63 pounds per capita in 1950 to 113 pounds last year. The prices of meat on the hoof are now moving through the upswing of a fairly normal cycle. The causes go back to corn blight and dry weather in the Midwest two summers ago. The supply of grain fell, the price rose, and farmers cut back the number of animals that they, were feeding for the market. But there is also evidence that in the past several months a most unusual thing has happened: the retailers appear to have widened their margins in a time of rising prices. The explanation is that consumer demand is now so strong that the stores can sell their meat even at higher markups. As one economist puts it, people</br></br>Mr. Stein, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, offers the hopeful forecast that ÛÏmarket forcesÛ will pull down meat prices by encouraging fanners to produce more. As usual, there is not much reason to hope that Mr. Stein is right. A relatively small increase in beef Is now in the feed yards, enough to bring down the price several cents a pound this spring. But, at the same time, the supply of pork will decline because the breeding of pigs is seasonal. Any significant increase In the number of hogs on their way to the butcher will require about a full year. Since cattle grow and breed more slowly, it will take several years to increase the supply of beefsteak and roasts more than marginally. It would also take, of course, a sharp change of heart at the Agriculture Department, where Secretary Butz is still advising farmers to hold down supply to hold up prices.",0,0.6667,0.33330000000000004

"Low Inflation, Economy's Rapid Growth Seen Blocking Shift in Fed Credit Policy. NEW YORK -- The recent slowdown in the economic expansion, coupled with continued low inflation, will keep the Federal Reserve System from tightening its credit hold, according to bankers and economists.</br></br>But the economy still is growing too rapidly for the Fed to ease credit conditions, these analysts contend. The central bank's policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, is scheduled to meet tomorrow to review its monetary strategy.</br></br>Even if the Fed leaves policy unchanged, some analysts warn that short-term interest will continue to push higher, partly because they expect credit demands to remain strong.
