"ron shelton appears to understand two things better than any other contemporary film-maker : sports , and kevin costner . put a sports movie in the hands of almost any other director , and you get the feeling that they're just biding their time until the big climactic game/fight/match ; put kevin costner in the hands of almost any other director , and you find the thin-voiced actor placed in the uncomfortable position of playing commanding and heroic . when the two men joined forced previously , for 1988's bull durham , the result was one of the best and funniest sports films ever , and probably costner's best performance ever . that casually charming costner is re-born in tin cup , yet another superior shelton sports film overflowing with pleasures . there are a lot of kevin costner bashers out there -- i have been known to be one of them -- who have forgotten that he became a star in films like bull durham and field of dreams which allowed him to be warm , funny and approachable . that is too bad , but it happened because costner himself and plenty of other directors forgot , too . tin cup is a reminder of costner at his best , boyishly handsome and with an equally boyish temperament , and he has so much effortless fun playing roy that it is nearly impossible not to have fun with him . he is like a little league player who never out-grew little league , always swinging for the fences and always eager to please . costner manages to make immaturity incredibly endearing . shelton has given costner a great character to work with , and has fashioned a great story around that character . bull durham was so authentic in its detail about minor league baseball that it was easy to overlook the fact that shelton made a film that wasn't just about baseball . it was about playing a game because you loved it so much you couldn't imagine doing anything else , and the frustration of seeing a player with less love ( tim robbins' nuke laloosh ) have so much more talent . roy's problem is that he understands all too well that fans don't watch professional sports to see the steady hitter , the guy who runs the precise receiving route , or the guy who can make all his free throws ; they watch to see the home run hitter , the flashy runner , or the 360 degree dunk . that is what makes a ron shelton sports movie better than anyone else's sports movies : he has a better understanding of the way fans and players think . he also knows how to create scenes which sing with unexpected wit . shelton also gives his actors subtly eccentric characters to play , with tremendous results . only the leisurely , golf-like pace of tin cup proves troubling -- at 135 minutes , it has a few too many dead spots , and a rather unnecessary tangent involving roy's stripper ex-girlfriend . but by the time tin cup ends , those moments will have been forgotten . you'll be thinking about how smartly and cleverly ron shelton can write a sports film , how good kevin costner can be in them , and how many sports might be left on which they can collaborate .

"contact is likely to change a lot of perceptions -- not only about the role of humankind in the universe , but about what special effects can do for a movie when they're used in the service of a story , rather than the other way around . contact is that rare big-budget motion picture that places ideas , characters , and plot above everything else . the film takes the richness of astronomer carl sagan's bestselling 1985 novel and re-invents it for the screen , retaining all the power and fascination of the book while adding a visual aspect that will not disappoint devoted fans . contact is as close as recent hollywood productions have come to a perfect example of cinema . all the elements are not only in place , but effectively realized . this is the kind of motion picture that restores one's faith in what can be produced when a large budget is used wisely . the participation of a superlative cast and crew doesn't always guarantee success , but , in this case , the high expectations have been met . the film is directed and co-produced by robert zemeckis , whose last effort was 1994's box office smash , forrest gump . as an on-again/off-again amateur astronomer , one of the first things i noticed about the film was its technical accuracy . this is undoubtedly the result of sagan's influence . all the details are correct ( at least as far as i was able to determine ) ; there are none of the movie cop-outs that film makers occasionally resort to in order to lower the intelligence level of the script . contact is believable in part because it doesn't replace true science with vague terms and gobbledygook . in his novel , sagan was careful to make everything , even the most farfetched parts , theoretically feasible . although the movie changes and condenses significant aspects of the original material , it remains true to this vision . contact opens with an unforgettable sequence that takes the viewer on a tour of the universe . it starts out in a familiar corner of space , with earth filling the screen . it's an amazing trip that only takes several minutes , but presages the wonders that contact's final half-hour holds for the viewer . although contact is rightfully being billed as the story of humanity's first encounter with an extraterrestrial life form , at its heart , it's really more about ellie and her quest for meaning in life . in her own words : "" for as long as i can remember , i've been searching for some reason why we're here -- what we're doing here , who are we ? "" ellie's trajectory places her on a collision course with answers to those questions , and it's the development of her character , and the resolution of this particular aspect of the story , that makes for a satisfying conclusion . in the end , the science fiction elements become subordinate to the personal ones . in its own unique way , contact offers a little bit of almost everything : drama , romance , suspense , and science fiction . it touches the emotions and the intellect . there are glorious special effects , wonderful acting , and a couple of impressive pyrotechnic displays . the plot contains the most believable approach to this subject matter ever presented in a movie . as he did in forrest gump , robert zemeckis makes excellent use of special effects . the standout sequences are those that take place in deep space and give us an awe-inspiring perception of how incredibly vast the universe is . but digital trickery , both subtle and obvious , is used on other occasions , as well . by carefully editing clips of clinton speeches and using a little creative dubbing , zemeckis makes it seem like the president is directly addressing the specific situations that arise during the course of contact . the cast is strong . tom skerritt and james woods take what could have been one-dimensional characters and develop them into something more . we don't exactly sympathize with them , but we understand their viewpoints . but the star of the film is jodie foster , who brings all of her considerable ability to the part of ellie , and infuses the character with passion , intelligence , and courage . foster deserves another oscar nomination for her work here . instead , in different ways , this movie recalls some of the best science fiction films . in fact , contact can stand on the same level as these and many other classics , and that is one definition of a great movie . if contact falls short in any area , it's an inability to fully develop all of its many subplots , but , given the time limitations of the medium ( the running length is already 2 : 30 ) , that's understandable . this is one of 1997's finest motion pictures , and is a forceful reminder that hollywood is still capable of making magic .

"there are two types of satire : high concept and low concept . both lampoon specific targets , but while the latter does so with more concern for belly-laughs than subtle , thought-provoking amusement , the former is often characterized by wit and intelligence . grosse fatigue , a quirky , unique product of french writer/director/actor michel blanc , is a high concept farce . during most showings of this film , smiles and chuckles - - not uncontrollable laughter -- will be in abundance . in grosse fatigue , names are precisely what have not been altered . in grosse fatigue as in life , blanc is a famous french movie maker/actor . bouquet is a glamorous actress and noiret is the suave , cultured man who graced international screens in cinema paradiso and the postman . only a special sort of director would dare take such obvious jabs at his own celebrity status , and part of grosse fatigue's appeal is that this film plays off egos rather than pandering to them . as has been expected of satires since the player , the movie features several cameos . actresses mathilda may and charlotte gainsbourg , and director roman polanski all make appearances . and , while they never show up in the flesh , icons gerard depardieu and emanuelle beart are the targets of several verbal ripostes . yet , even though many of the in-jokes refer to french cinema , familiarity with france and its movies is not mandatory to enjoy grosse fatigue . the premise , which demands a fair ( but not unreasonable ) level of suspended disbelief , postulates what might happen if a famous person had a double , and that double chose to masquerade as the star . by the time blanc figures out what's going on and decides to take action , it may already be too late . blanc has been referred to as france's woody allen , and the script for grosse fatigue is sprinkled with the kind of comedy and insight the new york based film maker is famous for . although the movie is occasionally hamstrung by technical limitations ( a poor score being the most obvious example ) , superb writing and solid acting make up for the few faults . thematically , the picture delves into such diverse ( and weighty ) topics as the nature of fame and personal identity , and the decline of the french film industry in the face of an all-out onslaught from hollywood . in the way it toys with reality and fantasy , grosse fatigue is a fascinating exploration of life as seen through the eyes of a perceptive and humorous director . blanc never allows his film to degenerate into a series of pointless jokes , but the serious side is also kept at bay . grosse fatigue is smart in both script and approach , and this makes for a lighthearted ninety minutes where turning off the thinking portions of the brain is not a prerequisite to enjoyment .

"don roos ( "" the opposite of sex "" ) , the director-screenwriter , has come up with a smart script and lets his adult stars act like real adults do and is not ashamed of the glossy film becoming a tearjerker , and when the romance story tugs shamelessly at my heart it feels good because there is a heartfelt rhythm in this film that allowed me to clearly see what the troubled couple is feeling without it seeming to be contrived , even though it is contrived . in fact , the film is thoroughly engrossing and well-crafted until the closing scenes , where some speeches are made to clear the air , which seemed totally unnecessary . what helped carry the film through such contrived spots , was the real-life romantic couple who star in the film , ben affleck and gwyneth paltrow , playing two hurt souls who don't expect to fall in love but do . they had great chemistry onscreen , and paltrow in particular , seemed to make the story appealing and credible . in the hollywood tradition of such love stories , it seemed easy for the audience to root for them to get together and make the romance work . the only thing is , that the film is a little tougher than how most mainstream films do romances but is not edgy enough to be an art film , so it falls into the category of being not one or the other type of film , which might cause it to be ignored by both audiences . sex is not presented as the prize here , as much as a serious and meaningful relationship is . it has probably been ages since that theme was tried as seriously as it was in this mainstream film , and that just might be the most refreshing thing about the film . since paltrow is the better actor , she mops up the screen in these scenes of anguish and is convincing as someone who has been damaged and is afraid of getting hurt again . affleck is good as an actor conveying someone who is arrogant and shallow and full of false bravado , but is not convincing as someone who has been down for the count and is bouncing back as a changed man . it left me wondering , how sensitive of a person could he really have become , if he could only help her materially and not understand that his drinking masked deeper problems he had in his character , such as lying ! but the film had enough of a realistic romance under its belt to not be buried for dead with its contrivances . in additition it had some pretty good players in supporting roles . joe morton always gives a fine performance , and here as the sturdy , no-nonsense businessman he grounds the film in some needed reality . this modest production scored with me . and if it didn't have that phony civil court scene at the end , with affleck forced to act in such a disingenuously apologetic manner , the film would have been much better . but i was glad to be taken in by what i was seeing onscreen , that is an adult romantic film , with the adults interested in having a real relationship . i'm so conditioned by now , that i think only foreign films or art house films operate that way .

"screenplay : clark gregg . director : robert zemeckis . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 130 minutes . a word of sympathy , first , for what lies beneath's director robert zemeckis : it's probably not his fault that dreamworks has been marketing the film with one of the most appallingly wrong-headed trailer and advertising campaigns i've ever seen . my critic colleagues and i often respond to certain overly-expository trailers with the comment , "" well , i don't have to see the movie now . "" never has that been more true than in the case of what lies beneath . if you've seen the theatrical trailer for the film -- or virtually any of the commercials or plot summary blurbs , for that matter -- you've been cheated . what lies beneath is one half creepy , effective suspense thriller and one half predictable , over-wrought suspense thriller . . . and the creepy , effective half is utterly destroyed by too much foreknowledge . you will find no reference herein to a later turn of plot that dominates advertising for the film . there may be someone out there who could be thoroughly caught up in zemeckis' knowing homage to hitchcock ( most specifically rear window ) , with its instantly loaded atmosphere of menace and a notable absence of underscore that makes many scenes even more unsettling . unlike that hypothetical someone , however , i knew what was coming . i knew the developments that would dominate the second half of the film , and their relationship to the events in the first half of the film . i realized that my time was being wasted on a set-up that had been blasted into irrelevance by some marketing wizard with an itchy trigger finger , the sort of cinematic thickhead who would have looked at psycho in 1960 and said , "" hey , let's put that girl getting stabbed in the shower in the trailer -- that's good stuff .

"sometimes you are fortunate to see something so special and unusual that you have trouble writing about it . kenneth branagh's new hamlet affected me that way . every time i picked up my notes to finish writing about it , i would switch to some other review instead . ( during the christmas season , there are so many films opening that i stay behind . sometimes i even have three press screenings at once . you can see why the new york times needs three film critics to cover all the movies . ) so why is there all this buzz about yet another adaptation of william shakespeare's "" hamlet "" ? afterall , there have been twenty-eight hamlet movies already . surely there is no longer anything new to say . four hours plus a twenty minute intermission to be precise . granted , that for those who hate shakespeare , the idea of sticking around this long will sound like masochism . yet , even people not enamored with the bard may be as blown away by this film as was i . let me explain . branagh chose the film's length for two reasons . first , he wanted to break with tradition and do a full text version of the play . this means that viewers would get to enjoy the many minor scenes that directors eliminate because of time considerations . second , he wanted to allow enough time for the play to breathe . this is the groundbreaking idea that makes the play so uniquely accessible . hamlet has more lines worth pondering than ten other plays , but usually the listener can not pause to reflect on them because the actors are flying through their lines so they can get the movie completed within a traditional length . never i have i understood or appreciated hamlet so completely , and i predict that others fortunate enough to see the movie in its full four hour length will feel the same way . there is much history behind the running time . let me summarize what i heard about it . branagh wanted a four hour version , but the distributors and the theater owners thought it would be a financial disaster for them . normally they could fill the theater twice during that period . moreover , the shorter version will be a 35mm print , whereas the longer will be the original 70mm . we were supposed to see the 70mm four hour version , but the print was "" stuck in london , "" so we saw a 35mm print of the four hour version instead . like sergio leone's once upon a time in america ( 1984 ) , which has both a truncated and a full length version , the longer one is the one is see . i would drive hours to see the four hour version of hamlet . given there was a massive storm the day i saw it , that is exactly what i did and was it ever worth it . this adaptation of the play is set in the nineteenth century . the exterior scenes were shot at blenheim palace where they used more artificial snow than any movie in history . yes , even more than doctor zhivago . ( the press kit assures us that it is "" environmentally friendly "" fake snow so you needn't be troubled by that while watching the picture . ) the music by patrick doyle ( sense and sensibility and henry v ) has a haunting and lovely theme as well as dramatic parts full of kettle drums , horns , and wailing choirs . beautifully sad and majestic music so memorable that you may want to buy the cd , the cinematography by alex thomson makes you feel the warmth of the interior and the cold of the exterior . branagh said he did not want "" gloomy castles and dour costumes , "" and his crew delivered . the sets are as inviting as the text is compelling . branagh is my favorite shakespearean actor and director . anyone doubting his abilities should see his brilliant henry v , which remains his best acting ever . branagh brings an intensity and a focused approach that illuminates every word he speaks . nay it is ; i know not 'seems . ' "" his thin lips quiver as he delivers the lines , and he appears as if he may explode at any moment . every actor puts his stamp on shakespeare's most famous lines , "" to be , or not to be . "" he delivers the speech in a mirror with the camera focused on the mirrored imaged rather than directly on him . as is appropriate , branagh is the star about which the other performers revolve . appropriate both because of his position in the play and because of his talent . nevertheless , the other luminaries in this star studded sky are worth mention and perhaps some oscar consideration . branagh says he purposely cast the film with a host of big names to ensure the audience can "" look and see and hear with greater clarity "" even the minor roles . i want to get the one exception to this rule out of the way quickly since it is my only criticism of the film . luckily , lemmon has only a few minutes of screen time . the rest of the actors range from quite good to exceptional . besides those already mentioned , derek jacobi gives a controlled and effective reading of the malevolent claudius . interesting choice since jacobi's signature role was as emperor claudius in "" i , claudius . "" that performance left an indelible mark on his memory of how the play was so "" exciting , sexy , dangerous , and violent . "" kate winslet ( heavenly creatures , sense and sensibility , and jude ) delivers the best performance of her short but talented career as the fragile and vulnerable ophelia . when ophelia goes mad , you believe it . charlton heston and rosemary harris are perfectly cast as the player king and queen . robin williams is quite funny in the small part of osric , but billy crystal underplays the comic role of the first gravedigger . an incredible motion picture experience . movies this good remind us of the power of the medium . see the four hour version . and try to see the 70mm version that i missed . 70mm gives images a three dimensional realism that the smaller 35mm format can never bring out . i have trouble imagining a more striking visual that the 35mm print i saw . you could see something even better . it is rated pg-13 . there is brief sex , some nudity , and violence . the film would fine for kids say nine or ten and up . i recommend this film to you in the strongest terms whether you like shakespeare or hate him , and i give it my top rating of * * * * . do not miss this film . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"there was no visible difference between the characterization of a sleek photography magazine , frame , that is the subject of the film , and the film itself , with all its glib characters provoking an air of chic fashion , all in the pretense of art . it is a performance that makes the film seem greater than how it really is . the complications that arise out of this new relationship is the springboard for the plot . the two of them seem to have a chemistry together and their kissing scenes did give us a needed look into their passions , with the more controlling lucy being in charge of things and instigating the relationship to be more sexual . she has most of the lines in the film that pack a wallop . the combo of the three women with different intentions and personalities , plays well , as the acting here is really fine . all the actors were properly ensconced in their roles and supported each other very well . eventually the film , after being carried along by sheedy's intense performance , dies an ungraceful death from too much of its slickness ; it ran out of things to resolve other than by means of contrivance , and it was highly questionable that the "" art "" seen was really worthy of being deemed as something special . we just lost interest in the characters , the film began to look like a commercial for a magazine that wouldn't stop and get to the main article . so what could have been cutting edge dramatics , if the lesbian romance was followed through further , turns out to be a film not about art , but more of a soap opera story , about how three women , at different stages of their life , get together and separate . all the pain that is there , is finally settled in the usual way sitcoms settle problems they don't want to handle any more . which left the film only somewhat satisfying ; it did create a proper atmosphere for us to view these lost characters , and it did have something to say about how their lives are being emotionally torn apart . but we only get a voyeurs look at them , and that is not enough of a look for us to say that we penetrated into their world of mind-games and drug induced delusions and need for each other . the film just looked too much like the slick magazine it presented in the film ; that it wanted to say something more about syd's sudden sexual reversal and about the despair in lucy's life , but it just couldn't get it out what it wanted to say , which is why the film became a let down . its style was , perhaps , too beautiful for its own good . it would have been wiser to develop more depth for the main characters and show them to be more than the superficial beings they seemed to be on screen . being a talented photographer is not necessarily being a fully developed person , as evidenced by lucy's dissolute lifestyle and poor decision making .

"oscar wilde -- satirist , playwright , and novelist -- was one of the great figures of the late 19th century . like many artistic figures throughout history , wilde's reputation has waxed and waned with the mutation of the social climate . today , he is regarded as a literary giant , and perhaps the best playwright of the second half of the 19th century . despite an uneven script and a rather mundane , occasionally-plodding narrative , the movie is compelling , largely because wilde's life was fascinating . throw in a number of top- notch performances and , even without any flourishes , the film offers a solid two hours of entertainment , and , for anyone unfamiliar with wilde or his work , perhaps education . as is often the case with a movie that crams 15 years of history into 120 minutes ( for the non-mathematical , that's only 8 minutes per year ) , there's a lack of consistency in the tone . certain characters and subplots are sadly neglected . in particular , i was disappointed with the handling of wilde's home life and marriage , which , for a man of his nature , was surely a point of great personal conflict and uncertainty . the few brief scenes of wilde with his wife and children didn't satisfy my curiosity , and the resolution of this story aspect felt sadly incomplete . there are times throughout the entire film when subplots drag on a little too long -- the relationship between wilde and bosie is a prime example . ironically , despite the languid pace of much of the film , the last 20 to 30 minutes have a rushed feel , almost as if the director realized he was running out of time and wanted to compress as much into the proceedings as he could . through it all , however , wilde stands tall as the magnetic central figure . for fry , this is a dream role -- in a recent conversation over dinner , he spoke eloquently and at length about his passion for wilde and his work . considering the sprawling nature of the narrative , fry is given a daunting task -- keep the audience involved in the story and anchored to the character -- that he carries off without seeming difficulty . volatile , passionate , occasionally spiteful , and often impatient , bosie has the kind of multifaceted personality that captures and holds our attention . law's careful performance makes it impossible to love or hate the man -- at times , he's a monster ; at other times , he's an angel . despite limited screen time , ehle manages to fashion connie wilde into a heartbreakingly sympathetic character , which makes the truncation of that subplot all the more frustrating . one of the many things wilde does right is to convey a sense of the man apart from his work . during the course of the film , wilde is often compared to some sort of literary prophet ( he has "" disciples "" ) , and it's easy to see how young men would be attracted to this charming , erudite man who uses his "" wit as a foil .

( how many of the roger moore/timothy dalton bad guys fit this type ? ) as is usually the case in a 007 flick , the bad guy is a megalomaniac . and that's where bond comes in . equipped with a brand new bmw that can almost drive itself , 007 goes undercover into carver's empire , pretending to be a banker . brosnan and yeoh click , and if there was ever a bond girl worth considering for an encore , wai lin is it . i can't be as positive regarding teri hatcher , who turns the supposedly-exotic paris into a bland , unalluring figure . her shared past with 007 is supposed to bring out his vulnerable side ( last seen at the end of on her majesty's secret service ) , but it's hard to believe that such an uninteresting person could inspire any kind of emotion . hatcher is the film's most obvious weak link -- fortunately , her screen time is limited . the action sequences are suitably entertaining . it's impossible to count the number of bullets fired , and there are pyrotechnics aplenty , including exploding missiles , a fireworks show on the ground , and a fairly spectacular climactic conflagration . for those who crave flashes , bangs , narrow escapes , and other action film staples , tomorrow never dies delivers . while the script isn't as openly jokey as some of the roger moore screenplays , it contains a fair number of one-liners . while some of these are predictable , several of them are unforgettably witty . brown's judi dench ) makes an acid comment about the roles of men and women in the politics of war , and moneypenney ( samantha bond ) offers a pun about bond's canny knowledge of different languages ( surely the best line of the film ) . there's also some playful repartee between 007 and his chinese counterpart . bond fans will likely love this movie . detractors will yawn it away as "" more of the same .

"screenplay : darrell roodt and greg latter . director : darrell james roodt . least nominally . i believe that is part of the point roodt is trying to make -- that post-apartheid south africa has become a dangerous ground of a different kind , much like the american inner cities -- but he has chosen a singularly monotonous and pedantic way of doing it . just beyond the nods to african culture and the wall of homilies you will find a dreary guns-and-drugs picture that feels like the least inspired of a hundred guns-and-drugs pictures you might have seen before . only the accents have been changed to distinguish the guilty . once you acknowledge the sociological curiosity , you are left with a film lacking anything new or interesting to say as a story . it doesn't help matters that ice cube is woefully miscast in the lead role . ice cube has proven that he can act , and he has a powerful screen presence , but the character he is playing is supposed to be a doctoral student in literature who has lost touch with "" the struggle "" while ensconced in the ivory tower . it is also a terribly one-dimensional performance ; it often seems that if he didn't have something to scowl at , there wouldn't be any reason for him to have a face . to be fair to ice cube , i don't think there's much that anyone could have done with such a ridiculous character . if i were asked to deliver lines like "" that's how you fight a war . . . with education , "" or , "" guns are for cowards , not warriors , "" i'd probably spend the entire film scowling , too . the main problem with dangerous ground even as visceral entertainment is that roodt doesn't know how to do it . he has written himself into a corner by setting up a story like american urban crime stories , but he seems wildly uncomfortable filming traditional action scenes . the result is perhaps the least interesting car chase in recent cinematic history , as two cars chase each other around the spiraling levels of a parking garage , and a climactic gunfight which is edited more with an interest in getting it over with than making it interesting to watch . if this same story had been set in an american city , it would be hooted off the screen for its derivative narrative , stupid characters and limp action . all-too-common ground , as well .

"a gorgeously filmed fable taking place in the steppes of southeastern iran , about the nomadic ghashghai tribe noted for the handicraft of their beautiful carpets . she appears like an attractive apparition sitting by the stream , where sometimes she is seen smiling sweetly and other times sadly reflecting the pains she feels in her tender heart , clad in a traditional dress , which is an ornate blue color that matches the carpet . to fully appreciate the tale , which is told in the same fanciful manner these simple nomads weave their carpets , one must suspend one's reality and enter into a fairy tale land of richly decorative colors and visions , and take heed as gabbeh sings her heartfelt song that "" love is color "" and that "" love is pain . "" we see the carpet as if were a magical one as it is spread out on the water . for those who value persian rugs , they realize this is so because of the all stories and detail that go into the carpet , making it an inspired work of art that gives it its intrinsic value ; it is a work of art that is unrivaled precisely because it is made without set patterns . the film was originally sponsored by the persian carpet industry hoping to have it made as a documentary . but if you can ignore that , you will see a film that turns out to be so endearing , that you will be taken in by the power of its raw beauty . this seems to be too much for the young girl to endure . i quite frankly don't understand all the cultural ramifications of the tale and what the exact meaning of its conclusion amounts to , but that didn't hinder me from being amazed by the stunningly lush landscapes seen and from enjoying the film as is . iranian films of this nature require a different way of looking at them , something that american audiences might take a lot of getting used to . this artistic ( not poetic ) film , is one that is not necessarily better than american films , as much as it is different from them . don't look for the usual hollywood formula contrivances to drive the film to its conclusion . this fairy tale film is a feast for hungry eyes ( i can't get over how the wheat fields depicted looked so much like van gogh's ) . but , with that being said , i would be remiss if i did not mention that this simple tale , is one that has almost no insight into modern iran ; it is a popular film , aimed at upsetting no one-- foreigner and iranian alike . if i had to compare it with an american type of film it most closely resembles , i would have to say a "" disney "" film . in other words , this is not a personal film , one in which the director's poetical vision is inspirational . instead , it is a safe non-political , though , beautifully shot romantic fantasy , that is more pleasing to the eye than to the mind . it is one to be admired , as one does a beautiful woman , but it is not one that invites further introspection .

"lynn hershman leeson is the director/writer of an intriguing cyber-fantasy film . it is a film that is strong on ideas about artificial life , memory , and immortality ; and , in the innovative technology it uses to convey its virtual reality story by using the latest in cutting edge technology , such as digital software photoshop programs . the film was structured around the idea of a double helix to be visualized in every scene and shot by using a dna image as a model for the actors' placement and camera movement . the actors appeared before nothing but a bluescreen and were photographed with a digital betacam and this was then transferred to computer images depicting the same victorian bed-and-breakfast rooms where ada byron king actually resided , the actors and the authentic rooms were then seen together in the live video . the film is much weaker on its drama than on its technology , as its characters seem to pale a bit besides the computerized images of artificial life that it created . nevertheless , for computer geeks , this is a definite must see ; for others , it should be of considerable interest to the more intellectual-minded who like to see something different for a change in a film , in a film that also has the ability to challenge the usual concepts of what reality is thought to be . as envisioned by ada , this information can lead to composing music and creating a poetic language . one of his pearls of wisdom goes something like this , "" information is like a mist that you have to breathe in . "" the concept offered in this film , of the possibility to retreat to the past for communication with historical figures and to gather information from stored memory , is an alluring idea and is certainly one that gives this intelligently made film a highbrow premise worth savoring . what weakness' there are to the story , come about from its complications in its storytelling and the didactic way it explains so much of its mathematical theory to an audience that needs this vital information made clear in order to help them make sense out of what is taking place-- but this ruins the entertainment value of the film and curtails its natural flow . as a result , that very riveting performance of a first-class actress , one of the very best , the illuminated tilda swinton ( orlando ) , is overshadowed by the film's inability to be more energetically engaging , though some effort was made to bring more life and passion into the story by showing both emmy's and ada's sexual passions unfold . but the story couldn't completely connect with all the characters involved and bring out their side of the story . if the film remained more focused on ada's story and we understood her work a little bit more , and if we saw why babbage got credit for the invention not her , it would have been in all probability an even better film . swinton is that good of a performer to have carried this film further if given more camera time . the film's ingenuous structure and imaginative nature suffered some dents because it misplaced its focus , not staying with the part of the story that was truly unique and inspiring . yet for those on the lookout for a brainy non-hollywood film , one that has an original flare to it , this one should prove to be more than satisfactory .

"heavy on poorly-edited melodramatic sequences , they give little inkling of the level of emotional honesty attained . luis mandoki's film succeeds not because it tackles alcoholism , but because it faces up to the trauma that eats away at the lives of the non- alcoholics in the family . one failing of the script is that it assumes an unlikely level of ignorance from its audience . alcoholism is such a pervasive social problem that it's hard to accept that anyone likely to see when a man loves a woman wouldn't have a better understanding of the disease than the movie gives them credit for . but take a peek beneath the veneer , and there are problems . as potent as some of the scenes between michael and alice are , those featuring jess or casey invariably have greater impact . it helps that both young actresses are believable . meg ryan and andy garcia were probably given the lead roles more because of box office appeal than an ability to bring superior depth to their characters . surprisingly , while neither turns in an exceptional performance , they are both solid , and each has a few scenes in which they shine . the ending is too facile , and when a man loves a woman may take longer than necessary to arrive at its resolution . there are moments throughout when the script is apt to strike a raw nerve with some , as is often the case when a "" real "" issue is probed with any degree of sincerity . whatever else it may do , this film does not play it safe , and the risks it takes keep the audience engaged by the drama . this is not an original topic for a movie - especially one about alcoholism - but the script does a good enough job establishing the dynamics of the green family that we never doubt that the story deserves to be told . the film's poignancy is its strength , even as occasional didactic tendencies are its weakness . in balance , the former by far outweighs the latter , making this a worthwhile picture .

"" ) aren't too painful to sit through . coupled with finely-acted moments when it's possible to feel gail's grief , there are times when ms . kidman doesn't bring enough substance to her character . this may be as much ( or more ) the fault of the writing as that of the actress , though , since it's hard to be consistently sincere uttering the occasional dumb line . haing s . ngor is so good that the scenes featuring chinese mysticism seem less foolish than they might otherwise . it's difficult to predict how tear-jerkers will perform at the box office since this , more than any other class of motion picture , brings out the public's fickle nature . my life isn't a russian tragedy , so there's exhilaration amidst the heartbreak , and the gallows humor manages to avoid being tasteless . those who go to this film expecting to like it probably will , and those who don't , won't . my life is good schmaltz--decent entertainment that has no qualms about mucking around with the audience's emotions ( thus making it a prime "" date movie "" ) . in addition to being far too blatant about its motives and having a plot that offers almost no surprises , the movie suffers from an unfortunate case of "" cuteness "" . stone-hearted movie-goers beware--many of you will loathe this film , and those that don't will probably have a hard time justifying how you could actually like it .

"every time a film based on actual events or including real historical figures appears , it seems that there are scholars stepping over each other to decry its lack of faithfulness to historical fact . whether it's shoeless joe jackson batting right handed in field of dreams , or the condensed time line in the recent quiz show , or any of a hundred other possible examples , there seems to be a widespread refusal to allow film dramas to be exactly that : dramatizations of real events , no more documentary than the re-creations on "" america's most wanted . "" as a moviegoer , my only question is , "" does it succeed as drama ? "" the answer for immortal beloved is that while it is sometimes quite enjoyable , it is better experienced than analyzed . perhaps the best , if most precious , way to describe immortal beloved is as ludwig von-adeus . writer/director rose has mounted a sumptuous production , gloriously scored with the subject's compositions and intended to bring some humanity to a figure most often seen as a wildly coiffed bust on a marble pedestal . and he manages to deliver some marvelous sequences : the sea of mourners greeting beethoven's casket ; his deafness revealed to an audience as he attempts to conduct an orchestra ; the beautifully staged premiere of the 9th symphony , as the "" ode to joy "" accompanies flashbacks to beethoven's difficult childhood . rose manages to wed sound to image in that manner that is uniquely cinematic , evocative without ever lapsing into pretentiousness . as successful as immortal beloved is as a sensory experience , it is not nearly as successful at establishing character . for better or worse , amadeus managed to make mozart a character we could relate to ; immortal beloved does not quite manage that feat with beethoven . but the fragmented nature of the narrative allows us only unsatisfying glimpses of the man beethoven might have been , and even rose's tendency to film oldman in medium and long shots contributes to this distancing effect . rose's choice of the "" immortal beloved "" letter might have seemed perfect as a jumping off point for examining beethoven as a character , but too often it just doesn't work . when the film stops dead for schindler to talk to one woman or another about beethoven , we expect some insight , and there just isn't all that much . though i have focused on many of immortal beloved's failings , i should make it clear that on the whole , i enjoyed it , particularly in the moment i was watching it . music coordinator georg solti fills the theater with grand music , and those scenes which simply feature music accompanying rose's images are quite powerful . but afterwards , i realized what that made immortal beloved : a somewhat ineffectual plot connecting some exceedingly well-made music videos .

"i had an empty feeling seeing this film from its dripping blood onset , which was really the drippings from a raspberry sauce being poured over a fancy poultry dish , to its ambiguous ending ( where it is suggested that all the killings are in the psycho's head ) , and by the time the trick finale comes about , my empty feeling is just as prevalent as when i was bombarded by all the lists of toiletries the psycho prefers , his fancy squid ravioli with lemongrass sauce and arugula caesar salads in those upscale restaurants , and all the butchery that took place during the course of telling this president reagan era fable about yuppie greed , a slight variation on wall street's- "" greed is good message . "" i felt i was tricked once too often in this film , that with all its intended satire , it still ends up being a rather tasteless film that basically had not much of a point to it . this is , to say the very least , a disturbing film , even if it trimmed down on the novel's savagery and that the grisly killings take place mostly offscreen . it is a film about someone who is only human through his vices . while the film tries desperately to catch something about the psycho that an audience could sympathize with besides his good looks , but what results is that he can't be put together to look like a real person . and that is what becomes the main problem for the film , it is both creepy and sickly funny , but it offers no insights into a serial killer's mind-set that hasn't been said before . despite the film's glitzy photography , all the beautiful men in it , its various techniques used to make this a thought-provoking film , all fail to convince me that when all is said-and-done , this is not a sensationalized film , reveling in the subject's sickness and need for pornography and violence and consumerism . this is a superficial psychological comparison , and though it might sound good saying the two are alike , if you take the time to think about what is being said , it becomes easy to see that there are just as many similarities as differences between the two groups . the only other thing that i remember from the detective's role , is that dafoe has a deep , rich voice , as his part was miniscule and not very well thought out . the men in his life , all colleagues and look alikes , seem to be dressed-up as gentlemen but underneath that veneer , they are neanderthals . in one successful scene , that is an amusing satire on status among the corporate-types , his colleagues compare their business cards as to the texture of the paper and the quality of the printing . but the film's drawback , is that it is only about a general person and not about an individual , despite bale's tour-de-force performance and the aims of the director to get more out of the film than the book got . it still has an unpleasant subject matter to deal with and is only successful in making passing comments about a way of life that is easy to ridicule- the "" me "" generation . i might have liked the film better , if it had the balls to stick with its serial killer story , as difficult a task as that may have been , which is the heart of the story anyway , instead of yielding to so-called good-taste and accepting a lame hollywood cop-out ending ( which probably was a business decision more than an artistic one , since the film will now at least bring in some profit ) . the film left me with an empty feeling , by implying the psycho is still a psycho , even if the killings are not real . i certainly don't think music or books about serial killers makes them serial killers or do their repressed thoughts . i believe they are that way because they are driven by what's inside them that is uncontrollable and all that could be done in a film that is not made just for entertainment or exploitation , is to try and see if we can understand them a little better . i'm not sure if i can say that this film accomplished that and i'm not sure if i felt wholly entertained by the film , though the film was to its credit was not an exploitive one . yet , an empty feeling is what lingers , even long after i saw the film and try to recall it . other than the film looking good , being titillating in spots , being competently put together and well-acted , i don't think there is much else to say about it that is thought-provoking .

"it's lighter , brighter , funnier , faster-paced , and a whole lot more colorful than before . yet somehow , perhaps because of the costume , it still feels like the same batman we've gotten to know in two previous films . the same , yet different -- and much better . considering all the attendant hype and long box office lines for batman forever , a review is almost superfluous . regardless , i still have an opinion , and since this is my usual method of getting it into the open , i see no reason to change now . so , here goes . . . there's a lot going on in batman forever -- probably much more than in either batman or batman returns -- yet joel schumacher keeps things on an even keel , moving swiftly without creating such a strong undertow that the viewer loses his or her footing . the film is a blast and , ultimately , a very quick two hours . in a relatively short time , we get a solid action/adventure story , an odd romantic triangle ( chase is attracted to batman ; bruce wayne is attracted to chase -- it kind of recalls the old lois lane/clark kent/superman thing from the first two movies about that superhero ) , and the most detailed exploration of batman's character to date . all-in-all , this is a very full motion picture . the same bizarre , larger-than-life architecture is evident , but batman forever's city is bigger and brighter . this is a jaunty , multi-hued place that reflects a lightening in the movie's tone . burton's efforts were lugubrious and occasionally borderline demented ; schumacher acts like a grown-up having fun in a toy store . how else to explain calling his hero "" a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent "" or making sly references to superman and the old , campy batman tv series ? as the pop icon du jour , jim carrey gets the lion's share of screen time . schumacher lets him go pretty much unchecked , which leads to a great deal of over-the-top zaniness . carrey fans will lap it up . personally , however , i prefer the comedian diluted -- there are times when his riddler gets a bit unbearable . nicole kidman is smart and sassy -- perhaps not as appealing as the leather- clad michelle pfeiffer , but certainly an improvement over batman's kim basinger . as robin , chris o'donnell is a hip and charismatic choice . and for those who want an anchor to the previous films , we have michael gough's reliable alfred . admittedly , under the suit , there isn't a whole lot of difference between michael keaton's version of the caped crusader and the one brought to the screen by val kilmer . after all , it's just a matter of how well their lips act . keaton's wayne seemed stuffy , standoffish , and one-dimensional . kilmer's personae brings the billionaire down-to-earth and gives him elements of passion and insecurity . i certainly didn't spend more than thirty seconds mourning the change in lead actors . given hollywood's poor track record with second sequels -- take the third installments of superman , star wars , alien , lethal weapon , and die hard as examples -- it's understandable if a viewer approaches batman forever with a measure of skepticism . in this case , however , the trepidation can be put aside . the latest batman proves it's entirely possible for a big-budget , overcommercialized blockbuster sequel to offer even the most cynical viewer a wholly enjoyable time at the movies .

"it is a sad and melancholic film full of great dramatic music ( juergen knieper ) filled with violins that added immensely to the intensity of the emotions . refreshing to see religion as a force for good albeit her attempts were all total failures . lots of misty eyes in the audience . the director and the cinematographer ( franz rath ) knew just how to handle it in a simple and controlled fashion . the acting by the four actors playing the two leads is phenomenal as is the direction . i was very moved by this picture . it forms wonderful images in your subconscious that stay with you . this is a movie about love kept . although it has many a tragic scene , the ultimate message made me feel like i had just heard beethoven's ode to joy being sung - very uplifting . the fine script ( felice laudadio , peter schneider , margarethe von trotta ) develops what could have easily been a complex and long movie into an accessible and standard length film . the characters are all ones that the audience cares about , and by the end , dry eyes are to come by . and yet the script never manipulates the audience , rather it approaches the story in a remarkable low key fashion . the east is shown to be full of orwellian logic . so there too was a happy ending . the promise reminded me somewhat of the unbearable lightness of being which is certainly a compliment , but the promise is a unique show thanks to the script and the artful direction of margarethe von trotta . the casting is excellent . konrad was not quite as close , but very similar . in an american production , we would have spent a ton of money and had the actors spend hours every day getting made to look older through makeup . i liked von trotta's different actors approach . the promise runs just 1 : 59 but manages to cover thirty years with perfect pacing . you will never be bored nor will you feel cheated that they are trying to cram too much stuff in . the film is in german with easy to follow english subtitles , and it is rated r . although it does have brief nudity and a little sex , i can not remember any violence . it would be fine for absolutely any teenager . i strongly recommend this film to you . if you are at all interested in love or history , you must see this film . it will touch your heart as it did mine . finally , i award it * * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : january 31 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

""" and to all the critics who hated our last flick -- all is forgiven . "" -- chasing amy's closing credits well , i didn't exactly hate mallrats , but i thought it was a comedown for kevin smith , the talented writer/director who debuted strongly with 1994's clerks . chasing amy fits in nicely with the director's previous two films . as in clerks and mallrats , there are numerous references to pop culture ( the ubiquitous star wars films , comic books , the archie comic strip , tv shows alice and star trek , and even a few in-jokes related to clerks ) . smith's brand of bawdy humor is also very much in evidence , although it should be noted that chasing amy isn't as hilarious as clerks . in fact , it could be argued that this film isn't even as funny as mallrats . instead , chasing amy finds other ways to satisfy its audience , and the result is the most complete and mature film of smith's short career . with chasing amy , it's easy to anticipate a certain degree of inventive humor , but what's a bit unexpected is the solid drama , effective romance , and strong characters . clerks worked because the dialogue sparkled , but smith has honed his screenwriting and film making skills since then . while chasing amy boasts the same keen interplay , that quality , along with first-rate character development , acts as a supplement to the smart , surprisingly original plot . the movie starts out as light as a feather , but it doesn't take long for us to realize that chasing amy isn't just another lark for smith . this movie is about something , and the deeper we get into it , the more we realize how emotionally on-target the script is . alyssa's project is the less testosterone-oriented idiosyncratic routine . but , whether or not it's really love , holden is in for a big surprise because alyssa is a lesbian . his observations about comic books , video games , and other aspects of life in the '90s are as insightful as they often are scathing . but this is nothing new -- it was evident in both clerks and mallrats . what's different here is that smith has crafted a touching , nuanced romance which may be the most memorable screen love affair since before sunrise . there are real human feelings and problems involved in holden and alyssa's relationship , and , every time the storyline threatens to devolve into a cliche , it somehow avoids the trap . there's also a rich subtext pertaining to the difficulty that many individuals face in attaining a level of comfort with their sexual identity . the best scenes are those that explore the evolving relationship between holden and alyssa . ben affleck and joey lauren adams , both veterans of smith films , develop an effective chemistry . adams , who looks a little like cameron diaz and sounds a little like jennifer tilley , displays surprising dramatic range and ability . like clerks , chasing amy doesn't shy away from profane conversations . there's even an instance when oral sex is compared to ( of all things ) the weather channel and cnn ( you'll have to see the movie to understand why ) . in fact , i can't print any of chasing amy's best lines here -- they're all r-rated . chasing amy is entertainment of the best sort . for nearly two hours , it keeps the audience enraptured . there aren't many missteps , and , those few that exist are minor and easily forgiven . chasing amy is touching , funny , sweet , and most important of all , real -- a welcome breath of fresh air . you can't ask for more than that from any motion picture , and you'll be hard-pressed to find a movie in theaters these days that offers anything more appealing , revealing , or enjoyable than kevin smith's third feature .

"despite a reasonably original story line , familiar characters , first rate special effects , and the hallmark meeting between captains kirk ( william shatner ) and picard ( patrick stewart ) , there's something fundamentally dissatisfying about this , the seventh "" star trek "" feature film . the problem is that while star trek : generations is undeniably a major motion picture , too often it seems like little more than an over-budgeted , double-length episode of the "" next generation "" television series . if the spirit of the series is ever again to boldly go , it will have to rise , phoenix-like , from the ashes . it's difficult to say how the general public will react to this film . unlike the previous sequels , generations is largely inaccessible to non- "" trek "" aficionados . however , with its focus on character development over action , it should prove enjoyable for those well-acquainted with the voyages of any enterprise . one of generations' strengths is its willingness to take chances with the familiar "" star trek "" mythos . this movie spends as much time tearing down old bridges as building new ones . there are problems , however , several of which are too obvious to ignore . first time feature director david carson's inexperience is at times evident . his film is inconsistently paced , with a few space battle/action scenes sprinkled liberally throughout an otherwise talky , protracted story . a combat sequence between the uss enterprise "" d "" and a klingon ship lacks any semblance of tension . looking back at the ship-to-ship duels of movies 2 , 3 , and 6 , there was a flair and buildup that is noticeably absent here . the battles in generations are hurried , and the viewer appears to be watching rather than participating , with little opportunity to savor the moment . equally unimpressive is carson's handling of a certain highly-emotional moment that figures prominently in the climax . again , perhaps he's rushing things , but those of us in the audience recognize that the scene should be far more affecting than it actually is . by comparison , generations' last moments are flat . malcolm mcdowell plays the latest--and probably the weakest-- "" star trek "" film villain . this is precisely because mcdowell's soran is too restrained-- "" trek "" bad guys tend to be at their best when hamming it up . shatner wears kirk like a comfortable garment , and somehow the film seems more alive when he's on screen . stewart , the consummate professional , is undeniably the better actor , but his presence isn't as arresting . even brent spiner , despite a wonderful , often-comic performance as lt . commander data , can't fill the gap left when kirk isn't around . one thing made obvious by this picture is that the "" star trek "" movies are in desperate need of musical continuity . dennis mccarthy is the fifth composer in seven films , and his score is perhaps the most bland of all . except during certain key moments when the alexander courage signature tune is used , most of generations' unmemorable music fades into the dimly-lit background . lovers of frantically-paced science fiction may find generations too static , and fans of the original series will likely be disappointed by the limited screen time accorded kirk , scotty , and chekov ( not to mention the absence of spock , bones , sulu , and uhura ) mostly , generations spends its running length searching for--and never completely finding--its niche . if there is an eighth "" star trek "" film , and generations isn't the series' epitaph , perhaps eliminating the burden of mixing characters from different eras will permit a less-erratic plot line . either way , however , "" star trek "" will never be the same . age and a few too many bad stories may have robbed kirk and company of their vitality , but nothing can take away their mystique--and that is the quality which will sorely be missed .

"gregg araki ( the living end/totally f * * * ed up ) professes in the opening credits that this is a movie about heterosexuals , as opposed to his other films about queers . but that is really a dubious distinction , as the sex is mindless , violent , and bawdry . many of the visuals displayed homo-erotic actions , and the film is about as romantic as a stool sample . it is an offensive film , made to parody other hollywood teenager films , by taking digs at do-gooders , the moral majority , the right-wing , the fundamentalist religions , and pop culture . but the film is so vacuous and poorly thought out , that it comes off as strictly an in-your-face stylized film , without coming up to breathe fresh air or manage to say anything worthwhile . the parody seems so cold and distant , and it comes from lowlifes who have peanuts for brains , which makes their attempts at black comedy seem futile . it was difficult to be amused by a film that was so childish , its dialogue so banal , and its whole purpose tied to being shocking . the enjoyment from the film , for those who get their jollies from watching something that is this gross and sexually hideous , is the flaunting of morality and the depravity in the violence . xavier explains his tattoo of jesus on his dick , by telling amy , he put it there , so people could say , i've got jesus inside me . besides spewing out green slime and still talking , the severed head rolls on the floor . there is a running gag about 666 and about religious or do-gooder slogans in every store ; one store has this slogan --up with hope -- down with dope . i guess this is supposed to mean that these three have bad karma . after seeing all the mayhem , absorbing the teens in action , watching how retarded and alienated they are , the film felt as healthy as a diet of fast-food , crystal meth ( speed ) , and shotguns . it failed to show the l . a . underground kids it made as stars of the film , as anything but cartoon characters . in some perverse way , i would recommend this as a blind date movie in a drive-in , for those young guys who want to see how their dates will react to all the grossness onscreen . for others , who might be taken with teenager films , but in a healthier and more comical way , stick with someone committed to making bad films about teens , such as ray steckler . all his flicks are funnier than this one .

"squat little extraterrestrial with a telescoping neck . well , actually , it's a golden retriever named buddy . from the trailers and promotions for air bud , you might be expecting a rambunctious sports comedy about a bad-team-made-good in the recent disney tradition , with a hoops-playing pooch leading a basketball team to victory -- sort of the mighty dogs . with a few token exceptions , it's nothing of the kind . screenwriters paul tamasy and aaron mendelsohn want air bud to be a touching story of a lonely boy and his dog , something warm but slow-paced , something decidedly _not_ the mighty dogs . given the formulaic drivel disney usually passes off as live action entertainment , that noble goal alone should have made air bud worth supporting . young kevin zegers is a decent enough actor , but he's fighting against some tough precedents when he tries to make his friendship with buddy uniquely compelling , as well as fighting against charles martin smith's languid direction . the second mistake is purely the fault of disney's marketing department , which will be luring unsuspecting kids and their parents to what they believe is going to be a slapstick comedy . buddy's impressive basketball tricks might make a nice five-minute visit with letterman or leno , but they're not the stuff a feature film is made of . with the exception of one minor chase scene and the big basketball game finale ( which features the ridiculous fiction -- and anyone who has ever been to a middle school basketball game will realize this -- of a middle school basketball game with a score in the 80s and a team which runs a pivot game reminiscent of medowlark lemon-era globetrotters ) , air bud is achingly slow . twice as many children in the screening audience were roaming the aisles as were enraptured by the less-than-antic antics of josh and buddy . it's tough to knock a family film which dares to avoid bodily function humor , but air bud simply has no focus or direction , a fact made abundantly clear when the ridiculous basketball game finale gives way to an even more ridiculous courtroom finale . air bud is really deserving of praise for only one reason : it's not what it's being sold as . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"one fun activity for parents during the holidays is to suggest an old film and see if they can interest their kids . although black-and-white films are frequently viewed as suspect , ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind . and if you can find a colorful action film , even if it is from six decades ago , then there is a real possibility of a take home hit . nominated for the 1938 academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold's melodramatic music , ralph dawson's fast paced editing and carl jules weyl's lush sets , the film is probably best remembered for errol flynn's charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley , a . k . a . robin hood . let me cut to the chase and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household . the littlest rhodes , jeffrey , age 8 , liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times and maybe more . i'll let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review . simply stated , the film derives its success from being one of the best of its genre , the swashbuckler . robin , with a smile from ear-to-ear , fights off a hundred men without a scratch . although the picture can be considered as little more than a 1930's james bond , the production values and the acting raise it above that level . robin hood is a classic story of rich and poor . robin steals from the rich and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows . robin , with his courage and athletic skills , serves as a role model for kids . and with the lovely olivia de havilland playing the dreamy-eyed lady marian fitzswalter , the story has heavy romantic overtones . filmed in the typical , richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor , the flesh tones are overly pink and there few color subtleties , which match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players . in scene after scene the picture charms the audience . who wouldn't fall for robin as he shows up incognito to win the archery contest , even if the outcome is so clearly preordained . watching the picture today does provide some jarring moments . sherlock holmes as the villain , sir guy of gisbourne , for example , just doesn't seem right , even if basil rathbone did have a real-life identity outside of his most famous role . and then there are those wigs from the makeup department -- so bad , they look like rejects from a mel brooks comedy . as was popular in the cinema of that era , people die with the most gentle prick of the sword and without any nasty , bloody holes to spoil the wardrobe or the looks . bad guys are banished rather than killed , and lovers go off hand-in-hand , doing nothing more explicitly sexual than kissing . the result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful , cartoonish figures . hollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore , so try to savor the old ones when you can . it is not rated , but containing absolutely nothing offensive , it would get a g rating and is fine for all ages . jeffrey thinks the film is "" great "" and gives it * * * * . he recommends the movie particularly for people who do not likely bloody pictures -- he hates the sight of blood in movies .

"the songs are '50s style hits that have shown their enduring popularity . many fans of movie musicals recall grease with fondness . it certainly isn't a momentous film , and stands a considerable distance downslope from the pinnacle its genre , but it became a huge hit in an era when the musical was well into its death throes . aside from the likes of little shop of horrors ( 1986 ) , the disney animated films , and evita ( 1996 ) , there have been few memorable , big-budget motion picture musicals since grease . the film was also popular enough to spawn a sequel , catchily titled grease 2 , but the less said about that sad endeavor , the better . no one thinks grease's 1998 box office total will come close to that of the first installment of george lucas' space opera , but it should still make a tidy profit . the digitally-remastered soundtrack ( which sounds great ) and the enhanced color can only help . grease boasts what all successful motion picture musicals have : likable stars , a simple but not trivial plot , and a lot of enjoyable music . familiarity with the soundtrack is undoubtedly one of the reasons for the film's popularity ? several of the songs have achieved pop hit status . who can't recognize "" grease , "" "" hopelessly devoted to you , "" "" you're the one that i want , "" "" greased lightning , "" and "" summer nights "" ? these may not represent great music , but they're a lot of fun to listen to , as their abiding appeal proves . their eventual reunion , however , is anything but joyous . to sandy , the reaction is like a slap in the face . in addition to the songs , highlights of grease include travolta's daffy , limber performance as danny , newton-john's sexy-but-sweet sandy , and a cast of adults trying vainly to pass themselves off as high- schoolers . despite all of the silliness and singing , the exuberance of youth lies at the core of grease , and , although everything is greatly exaggerated here , the film brings back memories of what it was like to hang out in the school yard , take a date to a drive-in movie , and attend a prom . alternately swaggering to prove his "" coolness "" and re-affirming his ability on the dance floor , the actor gives the kind of performance that's perfect for the role . meanwhile , newton-john is equally solid , even though , at the time , she was far better known for making records than movies . sandy's transformation from shy wallflower to leather-clad babe is one of the film's best-remembered moments . the supporting cast contains a number of familiar faces . grease works as a musical , a comedy , a light romance , and a gentle satire of teenage life during the '50s . in part because of its persistent high spirits , it's a delight to watch , even 20 years after it first appeared on the screen . there's no doubt that grease has a devoted legion of fans , so it will be interesting to see how well the movie performs at the box office . after all , it is readily available on video tape , and , unlike last year's big re-release , there are no restored outtakes and enhanced special effects . the only things grease has to rely upon are its reputation and its music . for me , at least , that's enough for a trip to the theater .

"is a light-hearted , quirky romantic romp about a date-from-hell . it most decidedly is not . it is a dark , disturbing and almost painfully honest character study which will have many viewers shifting uncomfortably in their chairs . the sensational performances of karen sillas and tom noonan should have added up to a sensational film , but they don't quite . in adapting his two person stage play , noonan manages both to under-direct and to over-direct , sacrificing much of the story's potential entertainment value for a more serious tone which simply doesn't ring quite as true . the first half of what happened was . . . , which establishes the characters through the mundane , is by far its most effective . it's a beautiful and sensitive performance , and jackie's genuineness provides a perfect counterpoint to michael's intellectual reserve , as he tries to maintain the upper hand through sarcasm without even knowing it . it soon becomes clear that jackie is far more perceptive than michael , and as the power dynamic shifts , michael crumbles . the development of this shift through the dinner is fascinating , if almost too understated . however , noonan is not content to deliver a sort of my dinner date with andre , and it is when the script takes an abrupt left turn into psychodrama that the film falters . noonan simply takes the scene too far ; children's voices whisper in the background , the camera shoots through the windows of a dollhouse , and sillas is lit with flickering candles like a voodoo priestess . the self-conscious arsty-ness of noonan's direction takes a serious scene and makes it almost a self-parody . michael's big breakdown is also played far too broadly . eventually begins too feel extremely scripted , losing the pinpoint honesty which had been its strength . is that it is much more interesting when its observations about human interaction are inspiring nervous laughter than when they are supposed to be inspiring serious contemplation . stories based on big emotional confrontations between characters are tricky to transfer from the stage to the screen . noonan only got it half right .

"bound is a classic film noir . it is made even more so with at once both innovative and nostalgic cinematography by bill pope . although it is a color film , his color palette consists of exactly five colors - black , white , gray , flesh tones , and red for blood . actually , there is a smattering of a sixth color , green , but that is it . if you have to see blues , purples , or yellows in your pictures , don't bother to see this film ; they aren't there . if you want to know more about the process behind this , last sunday's ( october 6 , 1996 ) new york times's arts and leisure section had a long and fascinating article about the cinematic process behind this film . the answer , so that i do not get a thousand letters asking me , is "" what is white to you . "" it seems there are innumerable gradations of white , and the colors of the sets revolve that fundamental choice . the wachowskis both the directed the film and wrote the script . although some of the strong imagery and shock value is the same , the wachowski are just not in the same league as the coens . the only other movie credit the wachowskis have is that they wrote the script for the formulaic action thriller assassins for sylvester stallone . all of this notwithstanding , bound is a good show with more twists and turns that you can count . if you can guess them all , go to the head of the class , i certainly couldn't , and for that reason i am going to tell you very little about the story itself . to make their film noir fresh and different , the wachowskis have the leads be a pair of lesbian lovers . she is tough as nails , has lots of tattoos , and is usually very greasy from her work unclogging drains . the other , violet ( jennifer tilly ) , looks sweet and harmless , but isn't . the plot is an elaborate double cross labyrinth . editor zach staenberg cuts the scenes fast enough to maintain the high energy , but not so quick as to confuse the audience with the time frames . the strong and dramatic music by don davis has the horns blasting to keep up the tension . subtle it is not . the sound effects editing is equally heavy . the acting is all good . although he only got third billing , i was particularly fond of joe pantoliano's realistic bumbling . it is rated r for sex , nudity , violence , gore , and bad language . this is a film for adults and quite mature teenagers not easily sickened when someone's fingers are being cut off . i had a great time watching the plot's twists and turns so i recommend this movie although granted it is not for everyone , and i award it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : october 8 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"she didn't plan it that way -- you _can't_ plan it that way -- but pretty woman placed her in that rarefied stratum of film performers audiences will come to see on the strength of their names . for a couple of years , roberts tried to fight for her right to be a serious actress , taking less glamorous roles ( mary reilly ) or supporting roles ( michael collins , everyone says i love you ) for a-list directors , but the audience made its voice heard : "" we want our pretty woman back . "" in my best friend's wedding , roberts concedes to being a movie star once again . that premise sets the stage for some potentially outrageous comedy of the "" all's fair in love and war "" variety , but roberts never looks entirely comfortable with being outrageous . the interpretation of movie star-dom adopted by roberts , screenwriter ronald bass and director p . j . hogan ( muriel's wedding ) involves never being anything less than likeable , never doing anything which risks turning the audience against you . they don't understand that one of the perqs of being a movie star is that the audience is always ready to be on your side . it's no great revelation that there are only two possible outcomes in my best friend's wedding -- either julianne will triumph over an out-classed opponent , or she'll learn in important lesson and make a sacrifice . in either case , we're ready to be amused by her machinations before we get to that outcome ; we greet julianne's announcement that kimmy is "" toast "" with a chuckle of anticipation , not a sigh of disapproval . the reason my best friend's wedding isn't a better comedy , the reason it meanders but rarely soars , is that julianne's feeble efforts are about as likely to toast kimmy as a hot water bottle is to toast bread . bass's script is guided by the idea that julianne's hands should never get too dirty . roberts has some wonderful reaction shots in my best friend's wedding , but she reacts far more than she acts . in one of the film's most ironic lines , julianne apologizes to michael for all the "" awful and not even terribly imaginative things "" she has done . bass might have been better served coming up with more imaginative things rather than apologizing for the ones he came up with . surprisingly , my best friend's wedding is still fairly entertaining , thanks to a few unexpected bursts of irreverence . director hogan , who is turning into a prime candidate to direct a musical some day , continues his fascination with lip-synching to pop chestnuts , setting a slick opening credits sequence to "" wishin' and hopin' "" and turning a rehearsal dinner into an impromptu sing-along to "" i say a little prayer .

"" he has removed most of the complicated psychological layers of the character and made ripley into a seemingly nicer sort of person , the murder he commits is not premeditated as in the novel but comes about when he is provoked beyond what his fragile nature can take . minghella paints a picturesque view of how these rich americans in the late 1950s live as ugly americans in europe , as the photography is brilliant , with its array of luminous colors , from mediterranean places such as san remo , palermo , roma , and venice . the beautiful scenery , villas , luxurious hotels , and splendid boat rides are just right for getting the audience all excited about taking a look at how the smart-set travel and spend their leisure time . this fits in nicely with the touristy look of the film . but the story , as engrossing as it is , can so easily be forgotten when the film ends . this is a big budget miramax film , not an arthouse personal film . its magnificent look took away any kind of noir intent the novel might have had if the film was done in the pure form it was written in . the film becomes primarily a character study about ripley and not a film that is too concerned about filling all the holes it has in its plot , which are enough to sink a ship . she just seems to be along for the ride- her part is a rather inconsequential one , though it is in the same vein as the tiresome parts she usually stars in , but here we are , at least , spared from seeing tears come down her reddened cheeks . we just see her justifiable petulant anger , as she gives ripley that knowing bitchy look of disapproval , indicating i know what you did to my dickie . ripley's main intent , will be to concentrate on absorbing himself in dickie's personality and to try to ingratiate himself with the womanizing and capricious wastrel- a part that jude does a good job of conveying , as he captures the character's nasty mood swings as well as his goofy flippant side . the scenes with freddie pushed the envelope wide-open and made the average intelligence that ripley possessed diminish in his chilling presence . hoffman's screen presence sparked keen interest in the story and made it seem more powerful when he was onscreen . when he wasn't onscreen , the story wasn't quite as fascinating , which made me wonder if he would have been even more suited to play ripley than the bland damon was . and , even if , there seems to be little sympathy for the idle-rich during ripley's spree , there also becomes less and less sympathy for the psychopathic ripley , who the filmmaker was insidiously trying to get the viewer to identify with . thereby , the film loses touch with the character who falls too far from the graces of any rationality for social acceptance , who is seen drowning in his own lies and trapped in his own guilt-ridden nature . in the novel , ripley is more of a long-range scheming sociopath than he is in the film . the new spontaneous twists in the film changes the mood of the story , and makes it more creepy but not more endearing . i think the reason for that , is because the matt damon part loses the character's rich rebellious flavor and makes him become less an antihero than viewed as a serial murderer . to fully identify with ripley would require the viewer losing himself totally in the character and seeing the world only through ripley's narcissistic eyes , and that is the way minghella probably wanted one to see the film and understand how ripley operated . the problem with that , is it simplified all the dark notions of ripley's character and lightened the burden of the story too much , trying to make it conform with the '90s style of film . as a result , this seductive film comes to a conclusion that failed to live up to the gamesmanship offered throughout most of the story . the film became less meaningful the longer it went on , and it ran for 139- minutes .

"i'm no marketing whiz , but it would appear that someone made a serious error in the advertising campaign for the new australian import sirens . one might be inclined to believe that the target audience is men , and that sirens is simply some soft-core porn throwaway . in fact , sirens has more in common with enchanted april than it does with emmanuelle . writer/director john duigan , creator of the wonderful coming-of-age films the year my voice broke and flirting , has fashioned another tale of sexual awakening , this time focusing on an adult , and it's a delightfully acted and beautifully filmed comedy-drama . sirens skillfully interweaves two themes without seeming overstuffed . that world is populated by wombats , insects and even flowers which take on a kind of personality . the characters native to this world are frequently shown eating apples , practically wallowing in their connection to original sin . lindsay challenges the christian notion of sin as linked to female sexuality , and sirens is largely the playing out of that challenge . at the same time , the issue of artistic censorship is very much part of the subtext . he presents the church's case with a respect for its views , and hugh grant is a charming and surprisingly hip spokesman . while the arguments are nothing special , and in fact tend towards the cliche , duigan treats the issue of art , its influence on the public and the artist's responsibility as a legitimate subject of debate . if there is any fault to be found with duigan's script , it's that he does skimp on his characters in the interest of establishing his analogy . the relationship between anthony and estella is not as well-established as it might be , and lindsay himself is little more than a catalyst for estella's transformation . macpherson and fischer look good , but they're given too much to say and it's never all that interesting when they do speak . however , sirens does quite a lot with its visuals , highlighting its glorious australian settings , and it maintains a frisky sense of humor about its sensual subject matter without sniggering over it . those who might be looking for a leering sex romp should look elsewhere ; sirens is lyrical , lively and thoughtful and always a feast for the senses .

"though the film subtly is weighted in favor on the feminist side of the question , it still for most of the film chooses , instead , to overtly attack both sides for caring only about their opinions and not about the individual . since the film will not offer its opinion about what to do with this not so nice or redeemable idler , but chooses to show its fairness by unfairly attacking both sides of the abortion argument . this leaves us wondering how much the filmmaker really cared about ruth . so it doesn't really surprise me that a film tackling a taboo political subject should be so cautious and centrist in its views . but what bothers me , is that this film came on pretending to be hip to the problems of the homeless . norm echoes all the obnoxious slogans and dogmas and hypocrisies of his fundamental christian beliefs . everyone in the film is stereotyped : the pro-lifers are republicans , religious fanatics , family value people , sexually repressed , drivers of station wagons , and self-righteous . the pro-choicers are democrats , lesbians , pagan worshippers , those with loose morals , without god , and insincere . again , the arguments against both sides is handled in an even-handed manner . both leaders are viewed as hypocrites . the only thing that can save this film from its cautious stand , is what you thought of dern's performance . and that is the rub against the picture , it can't get beyond the absurd nature of its satire , as everyone in the film remains a cartoon figure . so the outcome should come as no particular surprise . could this really be payne's idea of how to resolve the issue ? as for dern's grating and , at times , just too much of an annoying performance , it failed to evoke concern for her plight . by the film's end she still appeared to be white-trash , to be laughed at and dismissed as being someone society can't help . the entire film's satire was a futile effort at comedy . it's weak position on the issues allowed it to throw stones at everyone and seem like it was hip to what was going on , but in reality it changed no one's mind about abortion ; and , in the bargain , it wasn't a particularly funny film .

"i know what you're probably thinking about dance with me , because it's the same thing i was thinking . this would be nothing more than a bunch of dance sequences strung together by something that could only be called a plot if you were being particularly generous . even the film's trailer , which featured about a dozen words in two minutes , contributed to the impression that dance with me wouldn't be about characters , but about plastic wind-up dance toys masquerading as characters . yes , the film's original title -- shut up and dance -- would certainly prove prescient . i'll tell you what i wasn't expecting : one of the year's most appealing , charismatic performances . ruby is an enigma to rafael , since her fierce dedication to dancing doesn't seem to be connected to any real joy . simple stuff , to be sure -- perhaps even simplistic -- but dance with me sells its simplicity almost entirely on the strength of chayanne's appeal . though it's certainly helpful that he's has boyish good looks and an inviting smile , his success can't be dismissed as purely hormonal . he has to anchor both of the film's big emotional hooks -- tentative attempts to connect with the father he has never known , and the romance with williams -- in spite of a language barrier , which he does by acting with his face and body language as well as any young performer of the last several years . chayanne has that intangible something called presence , something that gets you more involved in a simple story than the material probably deserves . that presence is most forceful when he hits the dance floor in an exhilarating sequence at a latin dance club . the sequence hinges on rafael conveying to ruby the pure joy of dance , and that joy explodes from his every movement . as obviously choreographed as some of the "" spontaneous "" moves in the club might be , it's still infectious to watch when rafael seems to be having so much fun . anyone who can invoke singin' in the rain without inspiring gasps at the sacrilege has to be doing something right . first-time screenwriter daryl matthews ( also the film's choreographer ) makes the mistake of making ruby's conflict central at a time in the narrative when there's already plenty of conflict to go around . director randa haines , meanwhile , makes the mistake of spending too much time showing us the competition itself . if the point was to prove how much more exciting club dancing is than regimented competitive dancing , that point is made and made again for nearly half an hour , including ridiculous comic relief from joan plowright as a spunky geriatric . the solid chemistry between williams and chayanne is lost , the father-son relationship is buried and the dancing rapidly grows tiresome . predictable though the story may have been , at least is was energetic . dance with me decides to turn into a dance movie exactly when the dancing is least interesting , and after the hero has made his impression . his charisma makes much of the film watchable , until it reaches the point where , much to your disappointment , they make him and everyone else just shut up and dance . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"despite his immense popularity on stage , rodney dangerfield doesn't have a sterling reputation as a motion picture lead . with the exception of back to school , a delightfully dumb 1986 comedy , every movie to feature dangerfield prominently ( caddyshack , easy money , ladybugs ) has been a dud . meet wally sparks , a lame , late-january film dumped into a sluggish market , may well finish the aging comic's screen career . there's nothing in this movie that warrants the price of a video rental , much less a trip to a theater . generally , about the best one can hope for from a dangerfield movie is a cliched storyline filled with crude-but-humorous gags and one- liners . that is , after all , basically what back to school delivered , and it worked on that basis . meet wally sparks never comes close , because there's hardly a laugh to be found from start to finish . it amazes me that dangerfield , who in the past has been able to make the simple act of walking into a room funny , has turned out such a dreadful motion picture . meet wally sparks is easily among the ten worst comedies i've seen in the past two years . it's hard to put a finger on why dangerfield isn't funny here . he certainly doesn't seem to have invested his character , tabloid talkshow host wally sparks , with much vitality . the sex jokes , even when you can't see them coming , are old and tired , as if we've heard them a few times too many . this shtick is worn-out ; it might still work in comedy clubs , but any spontaneity is lost on screen . and , unfortunately , the one or two potentially-amusing moments have been shown to death in the previews , so their comic effect is ruined . even dangerfield's intention of lampooning the current generation of talk shows isn't successful . without that quality , there's little chance for satire to be effective . yet probably the worst thing about wally sparks is its failed attempts to inject character development and human interest into a one-dimensional story . by aiming for pathos , this movie comes across as pathetic . once the credits have concluded , however , it's all downhill -- fast . the film's premise involves wally toning down his show to stem the tide of deserting sponsors . enduring meet wally sparks is akin to watching a multi-car pileup , as each successive failure leads to a bigger thud . by the end of the movie , i didn't know whether to feel angry at being subjected to such a loathsome experience , or saddened and embarrassed for dangerfield and the others involved . by his own admission , rodney's not a happy person , and the public and critical response to meet wally sparks isn't likely to bring much sunshine into his life . this is truly a movie that doesn't deserve any respect .

"a pleasant film that is not all that good as far as the crime caper story goes , but still has something about it that is endearing . it's in the tradition of hollywood films as escape vehicles , as it evokes a nostalgia for those kind of b-films that the studios used to routinely put out and were not that worried about the gaffes in the production . if you're a fan of the 1940s film noir , especially the classy billy wilder "" double indemnity , "" then you should find much in this latest woody allen comedy/mystery film to remind you of that film and others like it . woody sets this film in 1940 and catches with amazing accuracy the upholstered apartment furnishings , the lingo of the times , and the clothing worn and hairstyles . it was like watching one of those b-films , but instead of being in b & w this one is a lazy color version of it . it's the kind of faded out coloring that would have been used to make a 1940 film noir , if they were made in color . the retro scenes of all the interiors were exquisitely designed by santo loquasto and shot by zhao fei in mostly plum and gold colors that burnished on the screen . that's a home he made burglar-proof . admittedly this is all a thin and rather predictable story incorporating the usual woody nebbish sexist and egotististical character , and to make matters worse it comes with an unbelievable heist plot and with mechanical one-liners with silly double-entendre sexual meanings . it's a role that he's ritualized and could do it sleepwalking by now . but it worked for me because i didn't care about all that and instead got caught up with the film's casual look and the way it caught the look of the period's film noir , and i found the clash he had with helen hunt brought out the sides of his personality that he's battling within himself all his artistic life . woody seems more relaxed in this role than he has been in his more recent films . and , since the film has no artistic pretensions--it's more a homage to the b-films of the forties , it seemed easier to handle than some of his more recent ritualized woody-by-the-numbers flicks or those pale imitations of those european auteurs he so much admired like bergman--films he slavishly imitated that never worked for him . mind you , this is not a good film but one that can be viewed as an escape from reality . something that is not all that bad during these troubling economic days of that compassionate conservative administration of president bush . seeing this film made me forget for the moment about bush's war on stem cell research and the way he goes out of his way to please his extreme right-wing supporters and those big corporations that also supported him . the same purpose could be said of those early films in the forties , with the world being invaded by nazis . escape films were very much in vogue and served a purpose . i don't usually care for escape films , but every so often they feel right and can be enjoyable if you can really escape reality by watching them . those are the kinds of films i let my critical guard down on , and that's the case with this woody allen flick .

"screenplay : m . night shyamalan . director : m . night shyamalan . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , brief nudity ) running time : 110 minutes . [warning : the very nature of this review may involve plot spoilers for viewers who have not yet seen the film . ] of all the benefits i have received from being a film critic , i may value innocence the most . it may seem an odd choice of words in a profession more often associated with cynicism , but it applies nonetheless . while the onslaught of studio publicity is impossible to avoid completely , the ability to attend press screenings serves as something of a buffer against expectations . it was impossible for me to react to the blair witch hype since i had written my review six months before its release ; i never needed to guard against becoming aware of key crying game-esque plot points . it was possible for my viewing experience to remain relative untainted , subject only to pre-conceived notions for which i could have no one but myself to blame . it took the release of the sixth sense for me to realize how much that innocence can matter . reviews and discussions meticulously avoided revealing the specific nature of the ending , but by then the damage had been done . i considered everything i knew about the film , and made an educated guess regarding what would be revealed in its closing moments . then i finally caught up with the film , and watched with my "" can i out-guess the writer "" glasses on . within twenty minutes , it was obvious that i had guessed correctly . i'm not going to suggest that it was particularly clever of me to figure it out . i will suggest that i probably wouldn't have been testing my cleverness if i hadn't known there was something to be figured out . the simple knowledge that there was a plot point to be sussed out set me to sussing . and i spent as much of the film nodding to myself at the clues i recognized as i did trying to get caught up in the story . the nature of the film made such behavior both a blessing and a curse . writer/director m . night shyamalan's pacing is so agonizingly deliberate that i was delighted to have something else on which to train my attention . conversely , i was able to give bruce willis's monotonous performance a bit more benefit of the doubt , and admire the craft which allowed shyamalan's little trick to seem plausible . the only constant to draw me from my reverie was osment , a sublimely effective child actor whose performance alone is enough to recommend the sixth sense . children in jeopardy are usually a narrative cheat , but osment's reactions to his situation are always more compelling than shyamalan's few moments of thriller gimmickry . the irony is that my connection with cole's plight was consistently undercut by my awareness that the film's payoff would focus on someone else . perhaps my long-standing aversion to physician-heal-thyself psychologist/psychiatrist characters ( coincidentally sparked by another willis film , the ghastly color of night ) turned me off to malcolm as an equal player in the story . perhaps the supernaturally comforting closing shot reminded me too much of ghost . or perhaps i never bought the entire arc of malcolm's story from the outset . it's hard for me to know whether it was the film itself or my constant view of its wires which left me unimpressed . the success of the sixth sense suggests that it has struck an emotional chord in many viewers . for me , the only chords it could strike were technical . there was a not-particularly-inspired gag often used by titanic detractors during its theatrical run , something along the lines of "" what's the point , you know the boat's going to sink .

"the premise of this thriller might be good , but even a great director like fritz lang and a superb cast consisting of joan bennett and michael redgrave can't save this film from its sophomoric use of freud to give the film's conclusion a pat psychological response to a serious mental disorder presented . the psychology was never convincing , the only thing convincing about this silly film noir is the moody gothic atmosphere it captured . if lang was not the director , this film could have been a real stinker . but he evokes as much suspense as you can out of such nonsense , and the visual images by the great cinematographer stanley cortez are truly remarkable . the film is worth seeing only for those reasons . but even lang himself thought this was a poor film , and he'll get no argument from me on that score .

"with a paucity of ideas , the studios borrow liberally from each other , causing similar movies to appear in the same time frame . kundun has two distinct parts -- before and after the chinese invasion of peace-loving tibet . the first half is as dull as dishwater . were it not for the handsome photography and the beautiful music , i suspect that many people would walk out . as i watched the minutia of the young dalai lama's life -- feeding the fish , learning geography , buying sheep and watching the rats in the palace , i began to miss the postman . as bad as it was , at least it had a narrative and some characters . kundun , in contrast , is satisfied to be little more than a cinematic tone poem and religious homage . using all native actors , the movie looks totally authentic even if melissa mathison's script makes it relatively vacuous . roger deakins's cinematography for the movie has already won awards . although handsome , the beauty comes as much from the terrain and the sets as the camera work . the orchestral score , which overpowers many of the scenes , is so clearly composed by philip glass that having his name listed in the credits seems superfluous . the cds should sell briskly . the first half of the movie , which needs heavy trimming , has all of the interest of a well intentioned , but lifeless , religious instructional video . since it takes persecution of the tibetans to breath life into the film , the audience may feel a bout of guilt along with the relief from boredom . rather than feel anxiety , ask yourself why scorsese took so long to say so little . the older actors playing the dalai lama ( tenzin thuthob tsarong as an adult and gyurme tethong at age 10 ) approach their parts with large doses of sincerity and reverence . we see starkly , but briefly , some of the atrocities inflicted on the poor tibetans . after the show ended , the audience at our screening left looking exhausted . did the story of one of this century's key religious figures have to be so inert ? kundun sketches the outline of a story and then fills it in with a music video . kundun runs too long at 2 : 08 . it is rated pg-13 for violence and would be fine for kids twelve and up .

"like its closest ancestor , the alien series , the new film mimic by writer and director guillermo del toro is as stunning visually as it is frightening . sorvino , who seemed incapable of playing anyone with an iq above 80 , proves that her talent is much broader than expected . her susan , while not near as tough as sigourney weaver's ripley , is quite strong even though she is vulnerable and scared . ( this is one of those good shows -- sling blade was another -- which will immediately be written off by many people as soon as the plot is described . afterall , not many moviegoers go to the entertainment section looking for a good cockroach film . ) the shadowy mood combined with the script's proper sense of timing -- the best monster movies delay our first complete view of the monster as long as possible -- yields a film that builds its terror properly . just as some of the sexiest films are those in which the people stay fully dressed but seem always on the verge of taking off their clothes , so it is with monster movies , the tease is the key . in the entire first hour of mimic , the monster , in the form of a shadowy figure of a man in a cloak , is seen only in glimpses . marco beltrami's eerie and foreboding music adds to the ever-present feeling that death is right around the corner . almost all of the story happens three years later , and -- you guessed it -- the judas breed did not die out , but instead mutated into something dastardly and human-sized . of course , at first we don't know that for sure . as in all horror films , people do stupid things . in fact the light of flickering bad florescent lights and low-wattage incandescent bulbs adds dramatically to the horrific ambiance . figures in the background are seen , but escape just before being noticed as the audience whispers a collective "" look out !

"it's actually a difficult decision , because , although the two movies have vastly different strengths and weaknesses , the bottom line is that they're of similar quality . grosse pointe blank is , at times , too dark and disjointed . romy and michele's high school reunion is , on the other hand , occasionally a little too light and vacuous . and , if grosse pointe has too much of an edge , then romy and michele doesn't have enough of one . that said , those expecting a female version of dumb and dumber are in for a disappointment . yes , romy ( mira sorvino ) and michele ( lisa kudrow ) have vacuum-filled brain cavities , and the film doesn't shy away from raunchy sexual innuendo , but the pervasive flatulence of the jim carrey/jeff daniels comedy is entirely absent . they have been friends for a lot longer -- two inseparable peas in a pod who have never fit in with the hip crowd and have never cared that they're outsiders . under the control of two such deft comic talents , romy and michele are exaggerated just enough to be funny but not so much that they're unsympathetic . in fact , the most disturbing thing about romy and michele is recognizing that there are actually people in this world who think and act like these two cartoon characters do . although i smiled frequently during the film , i didn't laugh too often . perhaps surprisingly , a lot of the humor is low-key , and there are very few truly hilarious moments . another problem is that the script unsuccessfully attempts to inject a little lame drama with a moral ( "" be true to yourself "" ) into the mix . i have no problem with ambitious comedies introducing dramatic elements into the storyline , but those aspects should be less banal than the ones pulled off the "" stock plot device "" shelf for this movie . romy and michele is at its best when it's being lighthearted and at its weakest when it takes a halfhearted stab at semi-seriousness . as in grosse pointe blank , the reunion is something of a disappointment ( actually , for reasons i won't go into here , there are two reunions ) . the final forty-five minutes features a few clever moments ( including a bizarre dance number with sorvino , kudrow , and alan cumming ) , but almost all of the best scenes occur during the first half . romy and michele boasts a lively supporting cast . julia campbell ( tv's men behaving badly ) is that staple of the reunion movie -- the stuck-up prom queen whose vocabulary is made up solely of put-downs . romy and michele's high school reunion is one of those pleasant movie-going experiences that doesn't offend , excite , or challenge anyone . there are all sorts of likable things about it -- sorvino and kudrow , accessible humor , and an '80s soundtrack that's the most definitive survey of the decade in pop music since peter's friends . first-time director david mirkin brings a lot of energy to the production , always keeping things moving . and , perhaps most intriguingly , anyone who has ever gone to a reunion will recognize a kernel of truth lurking under all of romy and michele's blond and brainless icing .

"-- johann wolfgang von goethe , "" faust "" nevertheless , the writings of top authors don't always translate effectively to the motion picture medium , as mother night illustrates . the material dealt with in the novel -- guilt , perception , and identity -- is heavy , powerful stuff . director keith gordon's ( a midnight clear ) handling of it , however , is uncertain , and , on at least one occasion , seriously flawed . nevertheless , because the premise and storyline are so compelling , it's impossible not to be drawn in , at least on some level , by mother night . in fact , for the first forty-five minutes , it's an example of solid , albeit stylistically unconventional , film making . then comes gordon's serious miscalculation , and , in a matter of minutes , all of the carefully-developed characters and situations collapse in a jumble of poorly-realized , surreal satire . parker and the vicious circle , the "" present-day "" scenes are in black-and-white , while the flashbacks ( which make up more than two-thirds of the material ) are in color . as adolf eichmann informs him in a critical scene , "" about those 6 million [dead jews] -- i don't need credit for all of them . i can spare a few for you .

"perhaps the most noteworthy thing about corrina , corrina is that it's a rare mainstream hollywood motion picture which has been produced , directed , and written by the same person . this happens a lot with smaller , independent productions and foreign films , but it's unusual for a major release . unfortunately , jessie nelson's triple-duty is almost the only thing that's unique about this movie . her tale of interracial and intergenerational bonding offers a series of images that we've seen before . she won't talk , nor is she responsive to questions or requests . the apparent reason for this is to add a little racial tension to the mix . this is as average as a motion picture gets . the storyline is a screenplay-by-the-numbers , following certain set formulas that should be familiar to anyone who sees more than a handful of movies a year . the script ( which bears a resemblance to that of last year's little-seen house of cards--the kathleen turner/tommy lee jones feature , not the british miniseries ) adequately tells the tale without trying anything daring or inventive . the actress doesn't bring anything new to a role crying out for something fresh . a similar criticism can be leveled at ray liotta , whose manny often seems devoid of emotion . corrina , corrina might have been a better movie had the obligatory romance been purged altogether . the most interesting person in the movie is molly , and additional time spent examining her relationships with corrina and manny would have been welcome . her reaction to racial bigotry is also carefully sidestepped--two scenes allude to it , but the issue is never confronted head-on . taken as a whole , corrina , corrina is a lackluster production . its attempts at sincerity are stymied by cliched circumstances and stereotyped characters . the film suffers from the problem that afflicts all films traversing this familiar road : when viewers know the destination , and recognize the route being taken to reach it , there's not a lot to hold their interest .

"it stars a famous , gorgeous foreign actress ( juliette binoche ) who boldly appears quite unattractive . it features unhappy and unsympathetic characters whose actions dare you to like them , but whose circumstances are so dire that you feel guilty if you don't . finally it has a director who figures that , if he doesn't proceed with excruciating slowness , you will not appreciate the gravity of the characters' situations and the importance of the material . in short , it's the high-minded type of film that will have those less dedicated filmgoers heading for the exits before the first 15 long minutes have elapsed . to be fair the actors try hard , perhaps too hard , and the images , especially those of the steel-gray parisian twilight , are handsomely filmed . with a patch over one eye , a cut and bruised lip and a splotchy complexion , binoche's normally striking beauty is completely masked . mich ? le and alex strike up an almost instant friendship and like nothing better than swigging cheap wine from identical large bottles until they obtain the desired degree of inebriation . with realistic background sounds and little dialog , the movie has the feel of a documentary . it's hard to criticize a picture like this with its lofty intentions , but it is even harder to sit through it all . this much can be said , the director does make living an indigent and alcoholic life look pretty unappealing . the problem is that in the process he makes watching the movie just as undesirable . the movie is in french with english subtitles . it is rated r for violence , language , sexuality/nudity and substance abuse and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are older and mature .

"perceptive is the best single word i can come up with to describe the ice storm , ang lee's near-masterpiece that deconstructs the american family . for , although the film is provocative , entertaining , and impeccably crafted , its greatest strength is its ability to convey truths that lie deep beneath the surface . the ice storm is perceptive about people , relationships , and human nature , and there's not a single moment in the entire 112 minute running length that rings false . then , in 1994 , lee was selected to helm emma thompson's adaptation of jane austen's sense and sensibility . the film , which was released in 1995 , earned multiple academy award nominations and ensured that lee would never again be relegated to obscurity . for his followup to sense , lee chose the ice storm , and the accomplished result points to a director who has matured in every way . the hood family , like so many others of the time , is dysfunctional , even though it doesn't appear to be . it's a coming of age tale that shows how the discoveries and development of the parents parallel those of their children , and suggests that age doesn't always equate to understanding . sexually and socially , everyone in this film is groping for answers , whether their age is fourteen or forty . in fact , it could be argued that the teenagers have a clearer and healthier approach to sexuality than their elders . more often than not , the children in the ice storm are open about what they want . the adults , on the other hand , feel the need to resort to deception and wife-swapping games to achieve the same ends . not only is the storm crucial to the film's resolution , but its vivid presentation makes it almost a character in its own right as it coats trees , power lines , and streets with ice and turns the world into a beautiful-but-deadly place . ( from a technical standpoint , it's amazing to note that lee created the winter wonderland without any help from mother nature -- as credible as everything looks , none of the ice is real . ) every character in this film is interesting , and it's a pleasure to spend time with each of them . no one here is perfect , and we're presented with finely-detailed portraits of flesh-and-blood human beings , with their strengths and weaknesses laid bare . it's amazing how real these characters are , and how profoundly engrossing such a simple story can be . however , for those of us who lived through that era , there are plenty of familiar images and items . some , like the bellbottoms , wide-collared shirts , and gas- guzzling cars , are expected . others , like the bubble umbrella and the anti-pollution tv spot featuring a crying native american , show that lee was willing to take things to another level of detail . while it's true that the ice storm may not represent the reality of the '70s , it effectively fits our memories of the time . the lead performances are all terrific . kevin kline elicits feelings of sympathy and scorn for the loutish ben . tobey maguire is believable as the kind of guy that girls always see as the brotherly type . as expected , ricci doesn't let us down -- her interpretation of wendy is knowing , intense , and nuanced . i have heard complaints that the trailer for the ice storm makes the film look uninvolving . if that's true , it does this fine motion picture a great disservice . then again , it's always difficult to effectively represent a drama using two minutes of clips . the ice storm's impact cannot be conveyed in such a short span -- this is a movie that needs to be seen in its entirety . the experience will be more than worth the investment in time . the ice storm is at times funny , poignant , moving , and sensitive -- but , no matter what , it's always perceptive .

"screenplay : hirokazu koreeda . producers : masayuki akieda and shiho sato . director : hirokazu koreeda . mpaa rating : unrated ( adult themes ) running time : 118 minutes . hirokazu koreeda's after life is a film that stirs the imagination instantly -- which is fortunate , because the overflow of good will has to carry through an ill-conceived conclusion . the provocative premise combines the post-mortem bureaucracy of defending your life with a conversation from city slickers about the best days of one's life . the memories about which they speak are intriguing enough in their own right -- some with tales about childhood innocence , others with accounts of adult adventures -- to spark reflections by viewers about their own favored recollections . more intriguing still is after life's exploration of the nature of memory as a combination of things as they were and things as we wish they could have been . even the conceit of creating a film version of an imperfect memory -- rather than using the archived videotapes of people's lives available to the case workers -- emphasizes the power of filtered , romanticized remembrance . for over an hour , after life delights with reflections on what we remember and how we remember it , letting the steady stream of interviews flow over the loose narrative structure . in the course of helping watanabe -- who considers his life so mundane that there's not a moment worth remembering -- mochizuki struggles with unresolved issues from his own life . after spending most of the film as effective supporting players , the rosencrantzes and guildensterns of after life cold-cock this "" hamlet "" and make it all about them . there's nothing inherently wrong with a movie about the longings of otherworldly guides , unless you count the fact that it's already been done a few times . but after life shouldn't have been one of those movies , since it already had so much going for it as meditation on transcendent life experiences . there's a strange appeal to the production's heaven-as-low-budget-independent-film-set look , and plenty more appeal to the tales of the deceased . it's hard not to suspect that after life would have made an extraordinary documentary , since koreeda's steady , concentrated medium shots of the characters describing their memories are so effective . maybe then koreeda wouldn't have been tempted to leave the strengths of his film -- which are plenty strong -- for the supernatural melodrama of long-lost loves . in my memory , this one will linger as a good film that could have been great . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"the pelican brief is the second john grisham novel to make the book-to-movie transition . like its predecessor the firm , it disappoints , which isn't such a big surprise considering the pedestrian story upon which it is based . instead of wondering why grisham's work doesn't translate well to the screen , maybe someone should take a step back and consider whether his page-turners are worth filming in the first place . naturally , this makes grantham as much of a target as darby , and the pair end up on the run . in the book the pelican brief , the particulars are different from those of the firm , but the basic premise is very similar . that's all right , and it makes for quick , brainless reading , but neither of the movie versions has worked . paradoxically , the firm's biggest failing is in straying too far from the written version while the pelican brief's flaw is in remaining too faithful . as scripted and directed by alan j . pakula , the pelican brief is a straightforward visual re-telling of grisham's book . with few changes , it follows the basic storyline , and includes a number of complications and secondary characters which seem superfluous on screen . the final result is an unnecessarily-long thriller that contains far more talking than action . pakula's direction is lackluster , showing little of the style that permeated his two most impressive pictures , all the president's men and presumed innocent . character depth and development are virtually nonexistent . grisham's book isn't a tremendous achievement in this area , but at least we get some insight into what various people are thinking . with that element absent in the movie , no one attains more than a two-dimensional status , and much of the entertaining in-fighting and political wrangling is lost to the viewer . john heard's gavin verheek is a perfect example . the supporting cast is impressive , with names like robert culp , john heard , sam shepard , and john lithgow all turning in solid performances . this may be the only film character to approach the level of the book version , and much of it can be credited to mr . washington's work . ms . roberts simply doesn't have the range required for the role , as becomes painfully obvious when she's supposed to express terror at a car bombing . that particular scene , as well as several others requiring deep emotional responses , presents a fair approximation of her acting limitations . one of the reasons for the failure of the basic premise in the pelican brief--that darby could uncover the truth while everyone else fumbles around--is that the lead actress does nothing to make us believe the possibility . ultimately , probably the biggest problem with the pelican brief is that it's a letdown . after all the running around ( and there's a lot of that ) , all the gory deaths ( there are a few of them ) , and all the anemic plot twists , the payoff is virtually nonexistent . instead of the rousing conclusion expected from a screen thriller , the pelican brief fades away into an anticlimax . those who read the book have no need to see the movie , unless it's to satisfy the curiosity of how the conjurations of the imagination materialize through the filter of pakula's interpretation . those who haven't read the book will find material to catch their interest , but it's uncertain how long this ill-paced production will hold that attention . so , after the disappointments of the firm and the pelican brief , we now await the cinematic rendition of the client , hoping that for grisham's books , the third time will be a charm .

"the major revision is that the film goes from being a full fledged movie to a good sitcom episode . the actors are pleasant enough , and there are several nice chuckles , but marshall is content with letting everyone glide along on autopilot . bestowing on holiday audiences a film that teaches good morals and is for the whole family is definitely commendable . and certainly , funny little sitcoms are a popular form of entertainment . it is just that movie goers usually expect a more substantial gift . they want their presents trimmed with more involving characters and with a director with a keener eye for humor . looking on the good side of penny marshall's gift to us , the preacher's wife is a good spirited movie even if it is terminally lightweight . here his performance is reduced to smiling a lot . he gives the least believable and most uninteresting characterization in the film . vance is a much better actor than his work here demonstrates . denzel washington's talent manages to shine through marshall's overly mellow approach . houston's specialty , as illustrated by her work in the bodyguard , is to provide the foundation about which the other stars build the movie . kevin costner provided the interest in the bodyguard , and houston's character was little more than focal point for the story line . the script gives houston some good lines , but she is not convincing . the sets and the costumes for the movie pose a problem . although the meantime between laughs is longer than it should be , the picture does have its moments . this well-worn bible of religious canons has a page with the microsoft windows logo so that the angels can recognize mankind's key secular insignia . the silicon valley audience at the press screening laughed harder at this scene than any other . more typical of the humor is the repartee among the leads . in a christmas movie season that glorifies finding a turboman action figure for your son because "" whoever doesn't is going to be a real loser , "" the story here comes to a refreshingly different resolution . this concluding aspect of the movie pushed me over the edge into being able to recommend what is otherwise a lame comedy and a lightweight remake . the preacher's wife runs about 1 : 45 i think , but the press kit does not give the time . there are two uses of the word hell as an expletive that push the rating from g to pg . there is no sex , nudity , violence , or other profanity . the movie can be seen by the whole family , but the slowness of the pacing will probably lose the interest of those under eight . i give the film a marginal thumbs up and a rating of * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"screenplay : akiva goldsman . director : joel schumacher . those suggestions should be absurd , but the way warner bros . is pushing john grisham's anointed one , they're merely the next logical step . it's one thing to be the flavor of the month , but mcconaughey has become the flavor of next month , a star without a previous starring role . that's a rather unfair burden to place on an actor , but now that a time to kill is finally here , it looks like the talent is up to the hype . leading an exceptional cast , matthew mcconaughey helps create some riveting moments in an occasionally melodramatic story . white supremacists are the nazis of the 90s ; film makers love them because they know we love to hate them , and because they don't have to worry about anyone protesting if they are portrayed as hissable cartoons . there are plenty of complex issues involved in the story of a time to kill , foremost among them the criminal justice system's entrenched racial inequities , but director joel schumacher and his frequent screenwriting collaborator akiva goldsman can't resist the impulse to be crowd-pleasers , providing plenty of moments for audience members to applaud klansmen being beaten , spit upon , arrested or otherwise mocked , all underscored by elliot goldenthal's strident strings . it is too bad that a time to kill needed the sneering evil and repetitive cruelty of overt racists like sutherland's character , and even the poorly developed sub-plot involving the involvement of the naacp , because it is so much better at exploring its more three-dimensional characters . a time to kill is exceedingly well cast , and the performances sparkle . he is being compared to everyone from paul newman to marlon brando to kevin costner , but none of those comparisons really does justice to his unique appeal . there is an absolute ease to his acting which you almost never see in actors his age ( mcconaughey is a ripe old 26 ) , along with a screen presence you rarely see in actors of any age . and in a film which features a few too many loud and obvious scenes , mcconaughey is absolutely electrifying in a scene which is emotionally crippling in its quiet power : jake describing the rape of carl lee's daughter to the jury in graphic detail . it is almost possible to accept that spacey's savvy prosecutor doesn't object to the obviously inflammatory remarks . perhaps he , like us , was simply transfixed by witnessing the birth of a star .

"screenplay : kevin williamson . director : wes craven . mpaa rating : r ( violence , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 105 minutes . in the late 70s and early 80s , theater screens were overrun by a film genre which had primarily teenage audiences filling the seats and sociologists shaking their heads . it was the golden age -- if that isn't a gross misapplication of the term -- of the slasher movie , where cutlery-wielding crazies turned every possible day on the calendar ( halloween , friday the 13th , prom night , mother's day , my bloody valentine ) into a stomach-churning ordeal . these films usually differed only in the manner of the violent killings , leading to a numbing predictability deserving only of parody . wes craven's scream wants to have some fun with the conventions of the slasher movie , but not at the expense of providing a few scares of its own . that presents problems as well as opportunities , as the self-aware script sometimes diffuses the tension craven can create as a director . in scream , the students at woodsboro high are facing more profound problems than the usual homework and bad skin . as scream begins , it looks like it is going to be a fairly conventional horror film , if an unusually gripping one . most of the familiar tropes of the slasher movie are in place -- the absentee parents , the improbably massive house with plenty of glass , the ever-alarming ringing phone -- but the sequence is still scary stuff , with barrymore providing an effective and convincing portrait of mounting panic . though much of scream becomes a joke at the expense of monotonously violent horror films , craven is not about to spit in the face of the genre which made his career . horror films in general are not the target in scream -- horror films with no style or imagination are , and craven provides both throughout the film , though nowhere as effectively as the opening . what happens between the scares is what gives scream its knowing edge . kevin williamson's script is loaded with references to horror films -- it seems that half a dozen are aimed at craven alone -- and loaded with characters who have seen other horror films . many of those references are spelled out quite literally , and they are the least interesting . some of the most subversive humor is the least obvious , however . scream plays with expectations effectively , making the guessing game part of the in-joke . the guessing ends in a climax which , while certainly surprising , isn't particularly effective . it is also excessively drawn out , as writer and director seem to engage in an ideological battle over whether it is going to be the climax to a horror film or a commentary on the climaxes of horror films . in the end it is both , which is to say that it is neither . some of the gags are quite funny , but the suspense all but vanishes in the final fifteen minutes as the characters talk their way through a comparison of this finale to the traditional finale . the script for scream is not clever enough to provide a consistently witty thriller ; it is sometimes witty and sometimes thrilling , but never both . that alone makes scream stand out from its genre cousins , though , as wes craven reminds us that terror can be fun , and not simply a grueling march through gore-spattered holidays .

"two things could be said for sure about this movie , which uses mostly nonprofessional actors , that it is disturbingly romantic and it is troublingly inconclusive . there is no telling narrative to sink one's teeth into the story , but the visceral images and the emptiness of the youth's quest are fully explored in an original way , by the first-time director , manuel pradal . metaphors abound in this film , so much so that one could overdose on all the heavily intended poetical images and still not find much to sate one's hunger for what this film is ultimately about , which becomes the film's major fault . if you want something that is predictable about this unpredictable film , you have it here , you can bet your popcorn money that before the film is over some innocent kid will get it . if you want to read some politics into this film , you might say that the director was using the local american navy base as a metaphor , showing the mixed-reaction it gets from the locals , as he tried to get at what the local reactions to the base are by showing that there is an undercurrent of disrespect and lack of trust for each other . the mystery about them , gives them a camus-like sense of existentialism , it is as if the more modern the story tries to be , the more it can be seen rooted in an old philosophy , a philosophy of fatalism . the beauty in the film is from the never stopping camerawork , picking up one beautiful scene after another , though what connection this all has to do with the movie is anyone's guess . as i thought this film was about loners versus the group psychology prevailing , whereas the loners can't function with any kind of social measure because their troubling souls can find no place in modern french society to fit in . the trouble with that pat explanation of the film , is that the film doesn't help itself any by overloading the imagery , so that if one wanted to , there could by many other explanations for what the film was about . after a certain point , that becomes an annoying feature of the film , as the two teens lose their humanity and seem to be only symbols for what the director was trying to say . this is possible because of there persistent silence and lack of character development . aside from being a stunning film to watch , i could see no beauty in its dark character portrayal of the lovers and the film's overall pessimistic attitudes toward youth . the film had too many missing ingredients in it for it to be impactful ; i could hardly remember the main characters just a week later after seeing the film , only remembering how alluring vahina giocante was and how beautiful the south of france looks .

"it's interesting to note that two of the best films i've seen theatrically in 1996 weren't made this year . in fact , they weren't even made this decade . the first , martin scorsese's classic , taxi driver , is celebrating its twentieth anniversary . championed by scorsese , this re- release was handled by miramax films , which has brought back to the screen one of the greatest suspense thrillers ever to be filmed . purple noon is an autopsy of a near-perfect crime , and a compelling look at the man who commits it . the fee for the job is $5000 , but , once tom becomes involved in phillippe's life , its seductive leisure entices him away from his original goal -- or so it seems . this is all really setup , because the meat of the story reveals that tom is , in fact , an amoral killer , willing to do just about anything to get what he wants . tom is without remorse ; the only emotion he displays is satisfaction at the success of his latest caper . the plot , which is a wonderfully twisty affair filled with ingenious turns , is a delight to watch as it unfolds . nothing about this movie is pedantic or predictable ; it's two hours of pure suspense that puts many of the recent so-called "" thrillers "" to shame . it's a masterful effort by director clement , and , considering the nature of the main character , it's not hard to understand why scorsese would lend his name to the re-release ( much as he did for belle du jour ) . one of purple noon's most obvious assets is delon's acting . tom is fascinating because delon makes him so . this isn't a run-of-the-mill villain ; he's a complex character with a well thought-out reason for everything he does . he may be a psychopath , but there's a quality about him that engrosses and seduces us even as his actions cause repulsion . and , because the movie centers on tom , there are times when we find ourselves hoping that his schemes will work , if only for the pleasure of seeing what he will do next . in addition to delon's fine performance , purple noon is characterized by expert camerawork and crisp direction . clement understands how to sustain tension without drawing it out too far . the film is exactly the right length , as are each of the individual scenes . cinematographer henri decae has composed each of his shots carefully , including a masterful series of closeups of delon's eyes that reveal the sinister intelligence behind the apparently-guileless exterior . with twisters and independence days packing theaters and grabbing headlines , it's easy to bemoan the current state of cinema . so far , 1996 has not been a particularly good year for movies . there's nothing so engrossing as watching a truly intelligent thriller , and that makes this film a rare treat .

"while the movie explores serious issues , it often does so in a playful , even comic , manner . there's a greek chorus of drag queens on hand to lip-synch old pop tunes that fit the current mood ( some of these numbers recall similar moments from the adventures of priscilla , queen of the desert ) . the script is peppered with biting one-liners and amusing anecdotes . depicted from another point-of-view , stonewall could have been a real downer . as it stands , however , finch has made this an upbeat , triumphant tale . la miranda is typical of the new york transvestite scene -- tough , hardened , and jaded . certainly , the most fascinating aspect of stonewall is its depiction of the gay culture thirty years ago . as homophobic as this nation is today , '90s views are nothing compared to those prevalent in the late-'60s . they willingly fostered the belief that homosexuality was an illness , courting pity in the hope that it would supplant hatred . stonewall is not intended to be a history lesson ; the time frame and setting are necessary to the story , but they are subordinate to the characters . some of the subplots work ; some don't . the believability of these two anchors the film , preventing stonewall from ever becoming too outrageous or seeming too preachy . we sympathize with the cause not because of rhetoric , but because we care about the characters . undoubtedly , that's one reason why this motion picture succeeds . another is that , in addition to having a heart , stonewall isn't afraid to have fun , which is a welcome change from the agenda of many grim , gay-themed motion pictures currently floating around the international film festival circuit .

"an alluring biopic about the provocative comedian andy kaufman that couldn't go futher than to provide an entertaining look at the entertainer . if one was looking to find out who andy kaufman was , this film would be of little help . the point of the film being that there was probably no difference between the performer and the person off-stage , therefore it believes by telling the story through only his performances should give one a good enough idea of who andy was . the kaufman role was tailor-made for jim carrey and he comes through with flying colors in a virtuoso performance , as this fictionalized biography of kaufman , shows his odd personality , obsessions , and mind-set . the film seemed flat in the parts when carrey wasn't performing and his story seemed superficial . i didn't feel as if i knew him any better because of this film than i did before , though , at least , the film didn't try to answer something it couldn't . but "" man on the moon "" was entertaining , even for someone like me who has never been impressed by his comic talents . i am andy . "" this might be the way it happened , but it made for bad cinema since he wasn't seen as being funny and his immediate rise to fame lacked credibility as it was filmed , even though we know it evidently did happen . the heart of the film and indeed what keeps it lively , is watching carrey go through his repertoire in a flawless comic manner . milos forman's uneven film is missing the true craziness of kaufman in the entirety of the story . he gets that ingredient not from the conventional way he tells the story but only from jim carrey's expressive performance , as the film went from bursts of great energy with carrey doing andy to dullness in storytelling . her part was so underwritten that there weren't even hints of where the romance or sex in it was , and there appeared to be no intimacy between them . she just seemed to be andy's prop , who looks delicious on the screen but was given nothing to do , but one turn on the wrestling mat . i can't help thinking , that aside from carrey's masterful performance , there's not much in this film to take away with you . the film seems to be an unadultered homage to kaufman , looking on the rosy side of his lunacy and not getting at anything else . kaufman seemed to always be searching for something , whether in studying transcendental meditation , looking for a psychic cure for cancer in the philippines , or a way to push the limits of comedy to a further degree , and what we see in the film , is that he never quite found what he was looking for , in a career that was far too short for a man of his energies and stated talents .

"since citizen kane mysteriously showed up at our local multiplex -- even the manager had no idea why they booked it , i decided to attempt to forget everything i knew about it and to try to look at it as the first viewers might have back in may of 1941 . even the greatest films , and citizen kane is universally considered to be the best or at least one of the best , were once just the latest picture playing at the local bijou . the audience may have known something of the story ahead of time , but they likely did not expect its greatness . oscar wells , then a beaming , fairly trim young man , directed citizen kane , played the starring role and cowrote the script with herman j . mankiewicz . the film's opening has the look of a creepy old gothic horror movie . this eerie tranquility is shattered by the blare of a newsreel . theaters then featured newsreels along with the double feature and the latest installment of some serial . the newsreel in citizen kane , although slightly comical , gave a documentary feel to the production , what we would call a docudrama today . since the movie was a slam at the life and times of william randolph hearst , a fact the audiences then were likely to have heard , the newsreel approach gave the film an immediate intimacy and accessibility . having just weathered the great depression , the viewers were likely to have identified with the film's ridicule of ostentatious wealth . just as the audiences were probably enraged at this waste of money , having recently worked their way back from poverty , they were also quite likely jealous . "" it'll probably turn out to be a very simple thing . "" this hinted to the viewers that the film wasn't just some elaborate mystery and that they should not feel cheated if rosebud turns out not to be very dramatic after all . audiences now know the answer to the mystery , but then it must have been intriguing . viewers must have had numerous theories since the movie doesn't give any substantial clues until almost the very end . once the secret is revealed , it seems at first to be unimportant , almost trivial . upon closer reflection , the importance that kane attaches to it is a key to understanding his character or what we today would call the inner child . the radical cinematography by gregg toland must have shocked the audiences then as it mesmerized them with its offbeat angles , dramatic lighting and stark use of shadows and silhouettes . the seamless editing by mark robson and robert wise , who would go on to become a great director , moves forward and backward in time without ever losing continuity . filled with intriguing layers , the story of kane's life becomes an onion that the movie keeps peeling . "" if the headline is big enough , it makes the news bigger , "" kane says , knowing then the power of the press to make news when before there was just a tiny , inconsequential story . with today's tabloids being so prevalent this would be a line seemingly more tailored to today's viewers . the movie shows this transformation with great finesse . the best-staged sequence in the movie may be the breakfast table conversations with his first wife . within just a few minutes we watch kane's marriage going from puppy love to bitterness to death as the couple refuses to talk . as a politician , he is an old-fashioned , moneyed liberal who rails about giving the little people a voice . that is certainly something easier for audiences to understand then as opposed to now . citizen kane has so much to recommend it that it is hard to guess how the first audiences must have felt . maybe they felt as we do today , in awe of having witnessed a masterpiece while realizing how incredibly entertaining it was . it is not rated but would be pg for mature themes and would be fine for any kid old enough to care to see it .

"carl theodor dreyer's emotionally intense masterpiece , the passion of joan of arc , soundly evokes the passion and resonance of france's heroine , the soul of her country , who was burned at the stake in 1431 for being a heretic and then in 1920 was made a saint , as if time can heal such wounds . not relying on the standard techniques used in silent films during that time frame , nor on the avant-garde and surrealist's vision of the radical 1920s on debunking the church , the danish filmmaker , dreyer , concentrated on making an intensely personal film , a film that eluded any known styles . the passion of joan of arc featured many close-ups of joan ( ren ? e maria falconetti ) and the judges , and used the symbols of the church to show the extent of its authority . though the film appeared to be shot without any long and medium shots , that was not the case . it just seemed that way because dreyer , for reasons of getting at the truth without any other interference , had made isolated shots of joan , showing how alone she was from her accusers , and from the soldiers and peasants watching the trial , and these shots became abstractions , allowing you to think of them as being solely close-ups . it is because of this style that we are forced to concentrate only on the main players and on the truth of the trial , and our attention is not diverted in any other direction . the genius of dreyer in assembling a cast that was perfectly suited for their parts is a major reason for this work of art and critically acclaimed icon in the history of filmmaking to be as absorbing as it was . he picked her because under her skin-deep beauty and makeup he saw her soul and the simplicity of her nature . no actor wore makeup , every attempt was made to make things seem as natural as possible . dreyer was rewarded with his choice for actress , by getting from her one of the greatest magical performances ever seen in the history of films . falconetti , interestingly enough , never made another film , but instead chose to go back to doing light comedies on the stage , except for a brief respite , where she repeated her joan role on the french stage . the rest of his casting was also inspired , this time by a mixture of professional actors and those chosen in the bistros , as he opted to cast for his english general , warwick , someone who in real-life was a cafe-keeper . the film's opening is a study in starkness . the contrasts between the two shots will be a recurring theme of the film : historical events will seem to be eternal . joan : "" i know nothing about that . joan : when i have done what god sent me to do i shall resume wearing a woman's dress . "" the filmmaking of the trial was so austere ; it was easy to believe that this was the actual trial taking place . the scene was so intense , that when it was being shot , all the stagehands brought her flowers on that occasion , and dreyer made the gesture of taking her tears gently into his hands in a moving tribute to her performance and how powerful it was . the film's spiritual sense of being is layed in the moral rectitude of joan and her willingness not to forego suffering . what captures one's imagination about dreyer's version of joan- and this film is almost completely his version- as he all but ignored joseph delteil's slight novel on which the film was based on- is that dreyer recognized that joan ultimately took a stand for all those who are opposed to social authority and who are determined to be true to their own nature and are prepared to offer whatever self- sacrifice is required . in contrast , is the honest gaze exhibited from the close-up of joan , who seems to be so much the better of a person than those pack of phonies she is forced to look at and be condemned by , that we are forced to see how the faces of evil are contrasted with the face of a good person , and dreyer's abstractions , of sticking to the shot he takes until you see what you have to see , until it grows on you , leaving you with a feeling of real sorrow as she is finally burned at the stake , in a trial that seemed in the film as if it took a day or two , but went on for about five months , in actuality . this is one of the most memorable films ever made , one that is hard to forget , as it ends on the bleakest of notes , with joan burned at the stake in front of a group of grieving spectators .

"sometimes the term "" high concept "" doesn't do a film justice . critics are partly to blame , since we use the term perjoratively to refer to studios' tendency to mix and match stars or previously successful film plots to create easy-to-sell , easy-to-digest packages . that certainly doesn't describe the truman show , though the premise is about as high concept as they come : a 29-year-old man named truman burbank ( jim carrey ) gradually becomes aware that his entire life has been the subject of a carefully controlled , 24-hour-a-day documentary/soap opera called "" the truman show , "" the most popular program in television history . no , there's nothing easy to digest about the truman show , which is exactly what makes it so brilliant . masterfully conceived and executed , as thought-provoking as it is hilarious , the truman show is everything studio film-making should be but almost never is . it would be easy enough to praise the film to the skies simply for creating its world so seamlessly . for nearly 45 minutes director peter weir permits only isolated intrusions from the "" real world "" reacions of viewers , wrapping the viewer in the inescapable "" reality "" in which truman lives . the emotional content behind that premise makes the truman show far more than a clever exercise in style . jim carrey's performance as truman is deceptively complex , because he's playing a character who often behaves with the forced good nature of a sit-come character . truman is like a child under the thumb of a domineering parent , which adds depth to the character of christof ( ed harris ) , the show's creator and director . in small moments we see christof behaving with the concern and tenderness of a father , but it's a twisted and controlling love . before it begins to appear that the truman show is a touch-feely triumph of the spirit story complete with swelling strings , i should note that weir and writer andrew niccol ( gattaca ) come at the material from a subversive and satirical angle . as much as it is about truman himself , the truman show is also about the phenomenon of television viewership , and more specifically about the phenomenon of blaming the media for giving the people what they want . the truman show recognizes that we are a nation of voyeurs who jeer programmers for pandering to our voyeuristic nature . the film's most memorable moment may be its final scene , where a heroic finale is twisted with a knowing nod to the fact that there will always be an audience for the next "" truman show .

"since the film didn't have a director , the film's star , charlton heston , suggested to the people at universal that they get orson to direct it ( this is heston's version ) . it was magnificently photographed by emphasizing the contrasts between dark and light shades as filmed by the great cinematographer russell metty , which abetted the imaginative tale , whose main story is about the downfall of the sleazy , obese lawman played with sheer brilliance by orson . it's a b-film more powerful and hard-boiled than the weak-minded upper-studio heads at universal could handle . the video that came out in the '70s was an interpretation of the three re-edited versions , which was far removed from the way orson wanted it seen . the film ended up as a box office disappointment , giving ammo to those in hollywood who said that he could only make an art film and not a commercial one . orson refused to recognize the version that universal sent to the movie theaters as his film , in fact he called it an 'odious thing .

"it's frequently a melodramatic and cloying process , and , even when there are gifted actors involved ( such as holly hunter in the jodie foster-directed home for the holidays ) , watching such a film can be a dull , uninvolving process . with the myth of fingerprints , however , writer/director bart freundlich has scored a coup : he has created a low-key holiday drama that's refreshing not only because it lacks the big discovery melodrama of most similar movies but because it's entirely believable . the same cannot be said of most of the returning children . at its best , the myth of fingerprints is a sensitive , intelligent examination of the dynamics of a dysfunctional family ( note : families in movies like this must always be dysfunctional , otherwise there wouldn't be much of a story ) . at its worst , which isn't often , freundlich's feature debut runs into difficulties with cliches : the overbearing father who has left his "" fingerprints "" on the lives of each of his offspring , the search by various couples to rekindle the old flame , etc . one of the most atypical aspects of the myth of fingerprints is that it isn't loaded with "" shocking "" revelations ? everything is pretty much as it seems and the friction between the characters is the result of normal causes rather than motion picture contrivances . plus , in true slice-of-life fashion , hardly anything gets wrapped up over the course of the picture . we see a few small dramas play themselves out , but the larger story , which began long before the picture's opening credits , is not cleanly closed . freundlich has a good sense of what makes for absorbing drama ? a quality that consistently applies to the myth of fingerprints . through strong , well-focused writing and with the help of a uniformly effective cast , the director gets us to care about every member of the family in a remarkably short span of time . the dialogue is also thoughtful and insightful , rather than trite . examples include warren's explanation for why he's going home this year for thanksgiving : "" it's been long enough that i can't quite remember that i shouldn't go , "" and mia's observation that family members are "" the first people you're supposed to be hostile to . "" the myth of fingerprints contains a number of noteworthy scenes , including some strangely quiet dinners and awkward moments between estranged siblings . but the best sequence occurs early in the film , on the night when everyone has finally assembled under one roof . one-by- one , the various couples begin to make love , and the concert of moans , thumps , and squeaks creates an atmosphere that is both poignant and funny , especially as we observe warren's reaction to all the noise around him . nothing much happens during the myth of fingerprints , but that's the point . for 90 minutes , freundlich opens a window into the lives of a few characters , and our perspective is so clear that we feel we get to know them . so , although the material is not especially challenging , the results are among the best for an american film of this genre . for those who appreciate this sort of simple drama , the myth of fingerprints is worth a trip to the theater .

"screenplay : leigh brackett and lawrence kasdan . director : irvin kirshner . mpaa rating : pg ( violence ) running time : 125 minutes . if pressed , i think most aficionados of the star wars trilogy would agree that the empire strikes back is the best of the three -- the best written , the best acted and the most skillfully constructed . however , it is not nearly as beloved as the original star wars , and though the newly released the empire strikes back : special edition is certain to be a success , it is unlikely to come close to inspiring the mania the return of star wars did on january 31st . so why will the same person who tells you to your face that empire is the better film only see it once this time around after seeing star wars two or three times ? the answers to that question -- and there are several -- are in some ways specific to this film . in other ways , they explain a lot about what people go to the movies to see , what they go to see _again_ , and why . what makes empire so extraordinary in retrospect is how many chances george lucas and his new crew -- director irvin kirshner and screenwriters lawrence kasdan and leigh brackett -- took when they had everything to lose by doing so . no image in star wars is as dark and creepy as luke's dream vision of his own face behind vader's mask , and obi-wan's vague homilies about the force in the original become yoda's extended lessons in an almost zen philosophy in empire . following a film which was the very definition of a crowd-pleaser , empire concluded with the good guys in disarray , one of them captured and another one crippled ( emotionally , if not ultimately physically ) . here was a blockbuster which had the audacity to mess with the most successful film formula anyone had yet discovered , a feature film which ended the way feature films just weren't supposed to end : with a cliff-hanger worthy of the old radio serials . those twists made the empire strikes back exciting and challenging in a way star wars wasn't , but they also made it a less satisfying movie-going experience . star wars ended with a victory for the heroes , a fanfare and a rousing ovation , allowing the audience to leave both entertained and with a basic sense of resolution . empire was not so generous . it took the simple good-vs . -evil the audience for a story set in that kind of world is smaller than the audience for a story set in star wars' morally bi-polar universe , and it's hard to imagine the empire strikes back would have been a success if it had been the first film to feature these same characters instead of star wars . the pure throw-back adventure of star wars was undemanding , but you were almost certain to leave the theater smiling , and ready to hop back on the ride again for yet another chance to come out smiling . meanwhile , the very complexity which made the empire strikes back a richer film also made it a film less likely to inspire multiple visits to the theater . after all , how many times did viewers want to be reminded that it was going to be another three years before they found out if darth vader was really . . . you fortunately , the special edition will inspire those who know star wars line for line to take a closer look at the empire strikes back , and it's not just what was there in 1980 which may impress them . there are fewer new touches than there were in the star wars : special edition , and those which are there -- a longer , more tense scene in which luke escapes a wampa on hoth ; enhanced footage of the arrival on cloud city -- are both less obtrusive and more useful . it is the sound , however , which is most spectacular in this new incarnation , an awesome demonstration of the kind of experience even a "" home theater "" can never possibly duplicate . the empire strikes back deserves its second theatrical life every bit as much as star wars , if not more , yet there were notably fewer people applauding at the end of empire . i'm not convinced that means the audience enjoyed it less ; i do think it means they will see it less . the amazing thing is that , in a cinematic economy where an unhappy ending is the kiss of death , george lucas dared to lure the star wars audience into a darker world at all .

"although several years in the past , his disastrous version of the bonfire of the vanities is still fresh in the minds of everyone unfortunate enough to have endured it , and his "" return "" to the thriller genre with raising cain wasn't a whole lot more promising . carlito's way is a step up , but this is not the same depalma who got the adrenaline moving with the untouchables . carlito's way has a number of superbly-directed action sequences , and there are moments of absolute brilliance , but these are connected by a plodding narrative that sputters to find an appropriate pace . two hours and twenty minutes is too long for this motion picture ; there are numerous scenes that could have found their way to the cutting room floor without sacrificing much of the story . the last half-hour has the electricity of any good thriller , except for one little problem : we already know the ending . carlito's way is not one of these . by knowing that carlito is going to be shot ( not to mention how it's going to happen ) , it drains away suspense from the big chase through grand central station . in fact , it's amazing that depalma manages to raise the finale to the level of excitement he achieves . presenting carlito's way in this curious fashion is apparently motivated by a desire to have al pacino narrate the story . this is a bad decision in more than one way , since the voice-overs are largely redundant , consisting of observations like "" i had a bad feeling about this "" or "" bad move , "" most of which the viewer can figure out on his or her own . coming off of his virtuoso performance in scent of a woman , one expects a lot from pacino , and he really doesn't deliver . his portrayal of carlito is competent , but not masterful . while it's helpful to remember that a below-par offering from pacino is often better than an outstanding job by many other actors , that doesn't prevent the viewer from comparing this to scarface , serpico , scent , and justice for all , and the godfathers . pacino fails to invest carlito with much energy , and there are times when the performance is flat . also , it becomes something of a challenge to identify pacino's constantly-shifting accent . sometimes it sounds puerto rican ( which it's supposed to be ) , but there are moments when it strays towards italian or is marked by a leftover southern strain from scent of a woman . perhaps the biggest surprise with respect to the cast is that pacino gets out-acted by sean penn , who hardly looks like himself with frizzy hair and nerdy glasses . penn plays an exceptionally annoying lawyer who spends most of his time snorting cocaine , and he does an excellent job in this low-key , but critical , role . for the most part , penelope ann miller is "" just there . "" her gail is perhaps too sweet to work in a strip joint and be the boyfriend of a gangster ; it isn't until one of her last scenes when we see a harder edge , and even then her performance verges on histrionics . gail's love is supposed to represent carlito's redemption , and the reason he thinks dreams are worth having , but i'm not sure the connection between them is strong enough for this to come across . david koepp's screenplay has some winning lines ( such as "" favor gonna kill you faster than a bullet "" ) , which isn't surprising considering the source material . technically , carlito's way is a combination of the innovative and the banal . the camerawork is invigorating , if sometimes a bit too exotic . depalma makes good use of the steadicam during the chase sequences , and this heightens whatever tension is present . the composer may do exceptional work for kenneth branagh , but his other movie music isn't particularly noteworthy . carlito's way probably should have been a taut thriller , but choices by depalma in both presentation and editing have hamstrung it . with the expectations for this film as high as they were , the impact should have been more forceful , and the focus better tuned .

"before hollywood got a hold of this theme , literature did . writers such as christopher marlowe , in his 16th century book on faust and goethe , writing about faust in the 18th century , used this theme . however , "" bedazzled "" is a remake of a more vulgar source for the faust legend , stanley donen's 1967 very funny satire , which starred ( and was written by ) peter cook and dudley moore . this "" bedazzled "" provides some lighthearted fun with the theme , but is not quite as wicked and not as funny . hurley gives this film its purpose and sense of tart humor , but even her role seems punchless and absurd . though , it is hard to understand why the geek wasn't more tuned into her and used one of the seven wishes granted to bag her instead of the rather ordinary frances . frances o'connor does an adequate job in a role that mainly requires her to be desirable in many different ways . she has a sweet smile and shows she can display a nifty tantrum , but compared to hurley's beauty and wit , she comes off second best in both categories and would not have been my first wish . all seven wishes are played out as comedy sketches , with some being terrible , filled with stereotype gags and dull-witted humor , such as the one where he becomes the witty author who is well-equipped but learns that he is gay ; some of them do have some spark , like the dumb giant n . b . a . the film uses the same actors who play fraser's unfriendly co- workers as comic characters in all the wish sketches , which adds a feeling of continuity , but it is played as if this material was more suited for a revue than a film . what this film lacked was a real sense of outrageousness , it seemed more like a benign tv comedy hour program than a satire that goes for something devilish . it painted too clean a picture of everyone . i think harold ramis could have come up with funnier and less obvious skits , there was a lot to play around with here that wasn't even attempted . the film went mostly for the physical humor of brendan fraser , who is no buster keaton and can't carry an entire film with his comic antics . the viewer watched him transform himself cleverly in each skit , but the film wasn't funny enough for it to sparkle that way , except in a few instances . i think when you make a remake , it should clearly be better than the other version or else it seems to me , there is no reason to make a remake .

"an autobiographical film of hou hsiao hsien , grounded in the history of taiwan from 1947 through the 1950s and the early 1960s . this was a very demanding and taxing film for me to follow , not because of its slow pace and lack of action scenes , but because i didn't have a full knowledge of what taiwan was historically undergoing during that time frame , therefore the many innuendoes and references to past events , didn't always connect with me , as well as it should have . i could only watch the film from the point of view of what i got from the film itself . and , that is , the story of a family , trying to cope with their own secrets and their own idiosyncrasies , that proves to be a very human tale , something along the lines of an ozu film . but he is also shown acting like a typical child playing games and running around with the other children , enjoying a rich childhood , growing up with many pleasant memories . the film is shot through the point of view of ah-ha . what is beautiful about the film is its lushness , the sunny colors it evokes , giving it a strange sense of touching down on a paradise , and the small matters that are very human that it pays very close attention to , like the softness of the rain falling , his father sitting so nobly by his desk , grandmother acting so eccentric and being loved by the family for what she is . this is a very subtle and wonderfully crafted film that depicts childhood in a very simple but relevant manner , that only a very few filmmakers have been able to do in such a sentimental but unsentimental way . this is a work of considerable merit . review on 2/2/99 ",1,8.648876892609998e-72,0.88292900861,0.11707099139

"sad to say , most wanted is yet another poorly-executed government conspiracy thriller , joining the lackluster ranks of shadow conspiracy , murder at 1600 , and conspiracy theory . most wanted is intended as a vehicle for keenan ivory wayans , action hero ( as opposed to keenan ivory wayans , talented comic ) . but , while wayans the actor has an undeniable screen presence , wayans the writer lets him down . not only is the screenplay for most wanted laughably absurd , but it contains line after line of the worst dialogue available in any film currently on a multiplex screen . yet the film makers still expect us to take most wanted seriously . in general , action films are not known for their intelligence , but this one takes assumptions of the audience's stupidity a little too far . for a movie this dimwitted to succeed , it has to keep viewers under a constant barrage of pyrotechnics , gunfire , chases , and other assorted thrills . it can't allow them a moment's pause to actually think . inexplicably , this is not first time director david glenn hogan's approach . so , although the action sequences are all well-choreographed , there are significant pauses between them . the film makers have foolishly inserted exposition into those dead zones , and the more we learn about the conspiracy underlying most wanted , the more we realize it would be better left unexplained . the movie opens with an offer . it's supposed to be a clean , quick operation , but it doesn't go that way . the conspiracy here has many levels , and the more diligently you try to figure out exactly what's going on , the more apparent it becomes how ludicrous the entire scheme is . most wanted features some adequate action sequences , but nothing that can suitably camouflage the weakness of the plot . wayans does the best he can with the role , but he only has himself to blame for its limitations . jon voight , who lately seems to be choosing roles that allow him to chew the scenery ( check out anaconda and u-turn for other examples ) , goes at it full-throttle here , recalling images of james woods and donald sutherland at their most over-the-top . jill hennessy ( a smile like yours ) is bland but attractive as dunn's hostage-turned-sidekick . and paul sorvino's quietly dignified performance is completely wasted . i'm getting bored of dumb action movies , and there have been far too many of them this year . when i go into a theater to see explosions and shootouts , i don't look for a script that resembles shakespeare , but i expect it to make sense and keep my attention . most wanted does neither . it's a poor excuse for entertainment , and , in the wake of the glimmer man , this has me seriously wondering about keenan ivory wayans' choice of motion picture material .

"the collaboration of these two individuals , along with one of the fall's most compelling trailers , gave me high hopes for fearless . it only delivered halfway . fearless contains a handful of gripping moments and one outstanding performance by bridges , but it also has some hollow interpersonal moments and a lack of focus that holds it back from real greatness . indeed , fearless maintains an intense , hypnotic energy for the first fifteen minutes , as max's odd new persona takes hold . then , rather abruptly and much to the worse , it shifts gears into fairly run-of-the-mill family drama . this tangent of the story doesn't work for two basic reasons . one , laura isn't all that interesting , and rossellini doesn't succeed in projecting any warmth or concern . second , max is such a jerk that i felt everyone would have been better off if he had just left . screenwriter rafael yglesias , adapting his novel , doesn't have the guts to really attack max's arrogance , and weir lets his christ imagery ( max probing a wound in his side ; max making mud from his saliva ) just sit there without any irony . their relationship is handled delicately , and avoids the too obvious step into romance . but again there are swings into scenes without a note of truth , like an awkwardly acted group therapy session . by the time fearless hits its wrenching climax , a flashback to the moment of the crash wonderfully scored by maurice jarre , i felt as though i had been through a ride as bumpy as the passengers on that plane had . while max klein's character may not have endeared itself to me , bridges' performance did . like he did in starman , bridges carries himself like an alien among us , but this time an alien with some smugness . this performance shores up my judgment of bridges as the best american leading actor around , and it almost holds fearless together on its own . however , fearless takes its metaphysics too seriously , and doesn't keep its eye on what works best : the reactions of two survivors to a world now seen with different eyes .

"going into selena , i didn't know or care much about the life of the late tex-mex singer , whose death in 1995 came just as she was attempting to break into the mainstream american pop market . as far as i was aware , selena's tragic end was just another minor footnote in music history -- i hadn't heard of her before and i didn't expect to hear of her again . then along came this movie , and , sitting in a darkened theater , watching selena's story unfold , my perceptions changed . i not only cared , but understood a measure of the tragedy that had stricken her fans . it would have been easy to trivialize selena's story , turning it into a sudsy , made-for-tv type motion picture . the details for something lurid and exploitative are there , but that was never an approach considered by writer/director gregory nava . it's not an original tale -- movies like this abound -- but nava's point-of-view is fresh . in 1995's my family , nava explored the importance of blood ties within a mexican american family . similar themes are woven into selena . nava has brought back much of the cast of my family to star in selena . the two key on-screen contributors to this movie -- jennifer lopez as selena and edward james olmos as her father , abraham quintanilla -- had roles in the previous feature . both are superb choices for their parts here . there's nothing cliched about the way olmos approaches abraham , who , in less expert hands , could have become a hackneyed type . jennifer lopez is radiant as the title character , conveying the boundless energy and enthusiasm that exemplified selena , while effectively copying not only her look , but her mannerisms . i wonder if selena's family , upon watching this performance , felt an eerie sense of deja vu . it's apparent from the clips of the real performer shown at the movie's conclusion that lopez has done a masterful job of re- creating a personality . the supporting roles are no less capably filled . while meza's performance is a little rough around the edges , she shows the kind of spunk we expect from someone who would grow up to become such a charismatic figure . one of the most fascinating aspects of selena is how it deals with culture clashes . this is a lesson that selena takes to heart . nava's film flows beautifully , and the concert sequences effectively capture the electricity of such events . selena achieves the perfect emotional pitch for the subject , and , though this is a celebration of life , youth , and family , our awareness of the inevitable end lends a sense of poignancy to the proceedings . it's impossible to watch selena's triumphant astrodome concert without remembering that her life would be snuffed out less than a month later . roberto clemente . these are just a few names in a long , long list . this movie will serve to further elevate her name and advance her legend .

"melville establishes his exquisite control of the subject matter by allowing the story to unfold in such a perfect manner . i suspect , not many directors have that kind of grace and understanding of life . . . melville's sense of how to tell a story has influenced many directors through his long career starting in the late 40s , and that list would include the great director , bresson , who developed the same style and feel for filmmaking as melville , who at times outdoes melville's melville , giving some the false impression that melville imitated bresson . melville's success comes through the intelligent use he makes of his eye for seeing what is spiritual and what is intelligent , and allowing it to be emotionally compelling . his argument for a god couldn't be put forth with more verve and intelligence , even though it didn't convince me , as he was not challenged with counter arguments by any one in the film who had the ability to present a cogent differing opinion , nevertheless , this film moved me to further expand what i think . . . it even shows that it is possible to have a truly spiritual person be a part of the church , something that i have rarely come across outside the cinema .

"nevertheless , what separates this film from the many other crime-gone-wrong pictures is that it's almost completely non-violent . there are no shoot outs , fistfights , or explosions . there is a gun , but it's used primarily as a prop . palookaville ( the title is from the classic marlon brando line in on the waterfront about losers ) is the debut feature for director alan taylor , who has used the stories of post-wwii italian author italo calvino and the 1956 comic heist movie , big deal on madonna street , as inspirations . as jerry says , "" we're not really cut out for this . some people are . palookaville opens with a jewelry store robbery gone bad -- but not in reservoir dogs fashion . it's not a very good plan -- parts are culled from the old rko movie , armored car robbery -- but they seem to think it's foolproof . one of the things that elevates palookaville over the likes of bottle rocket and things to do in denver when you're dead is its character development . although this film is sprinkled with comic moments and its tone is basically lighthearted , it treats its protagonists seriously . sid , russ , and jerry seem like real people -- losers with good hearts who want to commit crimes but lack the requisite toughness and cynicism . gallo's russ would like us to believe that he's a tough hood , but his hard personality is really a front . with an evocative score by rachel portman and cinematography by john thomas , palookaville has a feel that belies its $1 million budget . at times , the movie is funny , touching , and quirky . there are a few isolated scenes that don't work , but , in general , palookaville represents insouciant entertainment bolstered by an unforced message about not taking the "" american dream "" too seriously . after all , the people in palookaville may be losers with little hope of rising above their circumstances , but that doesn't mean they don't have hearts and souls . and , although it may appear tarantino-inspired at a glance , once you get into palookaville , you'll understand that it has a much kinder , gentler story to tell .

"mafia ! , like its predecessors airplane ! , the naked gun and hot shots ! , is a scorecard comedy . their goal has always been to throw as many puns , sight gags , movie parodies and bodily function gags onto the screen as 90 minutes could hold , operating on the premise that you gotta keep swinging if you wanna get hits . at the end of the film , a viewer's reaction is likely to be a subconscious evaluation of the jokes' batting average . if hits exceed whiffs , everybody wins ; if whiffs exceed hits , not so much . has two strikes against it before it even shows up at the ballpark , the first and most obvious being its satiric target . entrenched though the films and their situations may be in the cinematic canon , mafia ! just feels stale , as topical as a joey buttafuoco joke or a reference to bella abzug's hats . at least the godfather films will be well-known to most average viewers , though . the other major reference points are martin scorsese's mob-themed films goodfellas and casino . the number of gags baed on the latter film , including the opening credits sequence and the character of pepper ( pamela gidley , a dead ringer for sharon stone ) , is utterly baffling given casino's less-than-spectacular box office performance . references to more recent , more familiar films like forrest gump and the english patient draw big chuckles , while the casino references draw mostly blank stares .

"in a year that has seen numerous "" boy's-point-of-view "" stories , this is one of the better entries . however , instead of going for the nostalgia and sentimentality that many of these movies attempt , tito and me is basically a straightforward tale with a light touch and a serious message . zoran is forced to face the disappointing truth that childhood heros are often little more than self-constructed icons with personalities nothing like those attributed to them by a worshipful youth . the most interesting portion of tito and me is the first half , which concentrates on zoran's home and school life . his initial relationship with jasna is presented realistically with all the uncertainty of a child's first crush , and the confused interaction of the two families living within zoran's house is at once funny and poignant . the latter half of the film deals with the walking tour through yugoslavia's hinterlands , and this is only fitfully successful as zoran's disillusionment is brought forcefully to the fore . some of the comedy during these sequences seems both out-of-place and occasionally cruel . there's a lot of comedy in this film - some overt , but as much subtle . tito and me often succeeds because of its light tone ; a lugubrious movie with the same sort of message could easily turn the audience off or put them to sleep . with the exception of lazar ristovski , whose buffoonish raja is over-the- top , the acting is excellent . young dimitrie vojnov should especially be singled out for his natural , unaffected performance as zoran . it is in large part due to his effortless portrayal that tito and me is effective . numerous black-and-white clips of the real tito are used throughout the film and , while these are interesting for historical reasons , they create a slight artistic problem . the actor who plays tito ( voja brajovic ) looks absolutely nothing like the real man . as a result , with so many shots of the legitimate figure , it becomes difficult to accept the actor in the role . tito and me is a fine , fresh motion picture with a universal theme . you don't have to have been raised in 1954 yugoslavia to understand or enjoy this movie , which has a deceptively strong message for such a breezy tone .

"the problem with a story that relies almost exclusively on small talk is that they don't call it "" small "" talk for nothing . in robert altman's cookie's fortune , in which fishing is a favorite subject , a scrabble game gets significant screen time . you know the movie has problems when you find yourself more interested in the words on the board that the characters holding the tiles . the resulting confusion leaves you wondering why he can't restrain himself . one thing is certain ; altman can create atmospherics with the best of them . cookie's fortune is full of credible southern images , from the wide porches and ante-bellum homes to the sounds of the crickets and the banjos . with excruciating slowness , altman directs the script by anne rapp , which is so painfully obvious that you can guess all key events almost immediately . and when a young boy sees the key to the mystery , you can be sure that the adults will ignore him until just before the end of the movie . altman requires his viewers to endure half of the movie before the inevitable happens . you find yourself thinking that cookie should go ahead and shoot herself so the story can finally get in gear . the story's few tiny twists don't come until the end , but they involve a fairly uninteresting little subplot anyway . courtney b . vance is the no nonsense investigator . and lyle lovett is given a part that has little obvious purpose other than to give him a part in the movie . some humor ? la waiting for guffman would have been much-appreciated relief from the plot's tedium , but altman shies away from lampooning it as strongly as he should . the same could be said of the movie . it is rated pg-13 for adult themes , brief violence and some profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up .

"yi yi , by taiwanese writer and director edward yang , would be translated one one in english . the american distributors have chosen instead the less literal english title of a one and a two , probably because the movie is about the rhythms of life . although voted best picture of the year by one association of film critics , it is hardly that . while certainly not a bad picture , it is a long , meandering one that is rarely compelling . still , with its artistic filming -- most conversations are intriguingly shot from a medium or long distance -- it is easy to see how critics might fall in love with it . the relatively formless , slice-of-life plot follows a large number of characters . while the performances are all genuine , the script has trouble eliciting either tears or laughs from the audience . even though the story isn't all it could be , wei-han yang's cinematography is exemplary from start to finish . most fascinating are the scenes shot through the glass of moving cars . 8-year-old yang-yang ( jonathan chang ) is the film's most indelible character . least successful and more traditional are the canonically comical scenes like the one of kids dropping a water balloon on an unsuspecting passerby . although it has its moments , yi yi is the type of movie that , if rented on tape , would be one that you would likely turn off after half an hour out of sheer lack of interest . on the other hand , with an hour chopped off of its three bloated hours , who knows what might have been ? the potential is there . yi yi runs a very long 2 : 53 . the film is mainly in mandarin with english subtitles . it is not rated but would be an r for language and brief nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers .

"mad city is one of innumerable motion pictures that gets derailed on the long track from premise to realization . the semi-serious film , which stars high-profile actors dustin hoffman and john travolta , and is directed by costa-gavras ( betrayed ) , becomes the latest in the recent flurry of movies to make a statement about the growing lack of ethics in broadcast journalism . it's all ratings and entertainment value , not integrity ! unlike some of the more worthy contenders , mad city fails to bring anything new to the table . every aspect of this movie has been presented before in a better film with a more involving setup . if you've seen network , to die for , welcome to sarajevo , and especially billy wilder's 1951 biting satire , the big carnival ( aka ace in the hole ) , mad city will seem like a tired retread . the absence of originality and inspiration isn't mad city's only problem -- it also suffers from a shocking lack of subtlety . the film's goal of skewering the media is pursued with such single-mindedness that nearly every supporting character is reduced to a familiar type : the empty-headed local news personality , the arrogant network anchor , the innocent camera person seduced by fame and fortune , and the old- fashioned news director who looks on sadly as the story is manipulated . even john travolta's sam baily isn't all that interesting -- he's basically a dumb lug who lets circumstances get away from him . mad city says everything it wants to say in its first forty-five minutes . after that , it spins its wheels for over an hour , waiting for the inevitable conclusion . despite costa-gavras' best manipulative efforts , sam never captures our sympathy . worse still , he's a static personality with no dramatic arc . he's the same at the end as at the beginning , and it's difficult for an audience to connect with an individual who exhibits no growth . travolta does an adequate job in this role , but he doesn't have a character of substance to work with . hoffman , who previously played the less jaded but equally energetic bernstein in all the president's men , is excellent as max , mad city's dubious moral compass . but , although hoffman gives max flair , there's little that he can do to correct the overlong and derivative script . none of the supporting actors really stands out with the possible exception of alan alda , who does a credible imitation of a snake in the grass . mad city's overall picture of the media is decidedly unflattering . the movie is also awash in subplots , none of which amount to much . in fact , they seem like filler to pad the movie out to its nearly two hour length . for a film that covers so much material , mad city seems surprisingly drawn out , but the reason is that it fails to do much of anything well . the satire isn't sharp and the drama isn't effective . watching mad city , i felt much the same way that i did 5 years ago while sitting through hoffman's hero -- great idea , poor execution . mad city doesn't work because it's an exercise in themes and ideas that never gels into a compelling story .

"a number of words come to mind when considering walter hill's latest directorial effort , last man standing . a third is unnecessary . this exceptionally bloody film probably features more gunshots than all of bruce willis' die hard movies put together . the atmosphere is so thick and pointlessly "" artsy "" that it threatens to choke the viewer . and , since this story has already been filmed twice before , in much better versions ( akira kurosawa's 1961 yojimbo and sergio leone's 1964 a fistful of dollars ) , the audience is left wondering why hollywood felt the need to do it again . however , since that's exactly what a fistful of dollars did , the film makers felt compelled to add a prohibition-era flavor to the mix . the result is a bizarre mixture of western and gangster genres that doesn't really work . and , whatever other problems last man standing may exhibit , the lead actor's performance isn't among them . this pulls smith into jericho's unstable political situation . hill goes way overboard with atmosphere , incorporating elements of everything from traditional western and gangster motifs to film noir cliches . almost every outdoor scene features a dust storm and every indoor sequence is heavily shadowed . at times , the blowing dust bleeds out color , leaving us with shots that appear to be almost black-and- white . it's a clever conceit , but totally superfluous . atmosphere is supposed to be a background element , but hill forces it into the foreground , as if attempting to overcompensate for structural and plausibility problems in his script . then there's ry cooder's hard rock score , which seems vastly out of place for this sort of period piece . over-the-top , cartoonish violence is a big part of last man standing . hill is not sam peckinpah , however , and , as a result , much of the bloodshed comes across as gratuitous rather than stylized . sure , there are a lot of people we want to see killed , but this sort of wholesale carnage is more repetitious than satisfying . christopher walken is at his maniacal best as hickey , although , at this point in his career , i'm beginning to wonder if he can play anything other than a psycho . worse , the secondary characters are a poorly- developed lot , with motives that vary from incomprehensible to merely unexplained . as a shallow tale of conscienceless bloodshed and revenge , last man standing is reasonably effective . but as an updated version of the far better-realized yojimbo , it's an unqualified failure . last man standing is a surface picture -- it looks good , sounds good , and moves quickly -- but there's no depth whatsoever .

"writers are smacked around so often and with such impunity in hollywood that it is perfectly understandable when a writer insists on directing his or her own material . it similarly makes sense , i suppose , for a playwright to want to direct the film adaptation of his own material , and herb gardner has been unusually protective of his plays . in 1986 , he directed his own adaptation of the goodbye people ; in 1996 , he directed his own adaptation of i'm not rappaport . clearly gardner is attached to his creations . in fact , he is far too attached . another director might have identified i'm not rappaport as a meandering play with one interesting idea , and given it the good tightening up it needed . gardner clings to every line and situation , turning out a sluggish and repetitive meditation on aging . i'm not rappaport is about a man's attempt to retain his dignity in spite of advancing years , and there are strong possibilities in the character of nat . walter matthau and ossie davis both give solid performances , obviously appreciating their own opportunities in rare leading roles , and there is an affecting sincerity to their comments about giving respect where it is due . that scene between nat , midge and danforth is noteworthy not just because it is the best one in i'm not rappaport , but also because it says everything gardner has to say that is worth saying . the relationships are not compelling enough by themselves to carry those scenes , and the point that seniors are under-estimated and mis-treated is made and made and made again . as i'm not rappaport wanders through the last of its 133 minutes , you may begin to feel that you have been sitting in your seat as long as its main characters have been alive . worse still , it leaves us with the depressing notion that the elderly should be seen and not heard . gardner didn't need to take us through over two hours of hoops just so that we could end up right where we started . well-intentioned and well-acted though it might be , i'm not rappaport is the product of a writer too married to every word , and a director too sparing with the knife .

"the director purposely cast most of the leads to either be actors you've never heard of or actors playing against type . the film's one briefly comedic scene has pearce playing the role of the straight man . the audience loved it , probably because the humor was so unexpected . kevin spacey imbues any character he plays with an unidentifiable something special . arguably the best and worst part of the film version is the surfeit of characters . while this probably worked well in the book and while it gives the story the feel of an epic , it can sometimes be frustrating to follow . most of the characters are surprising well developed , thanks to the almost 2 1/2 hour length , but there remain quite a few who are only sketched and who should have been left out entirely . as he talks to the audience , his typewriter provides the rhythm . the latter mystery occupies most of the story . as a mystery it isn't much , but the director manages to elicit such good performances out of his cast and to create such a fascinating world that the picture compels despite its limitations . a side story has a group of "" high-class whores cut to look like movie stars .

"perhaps disney should take a lesson from writer/director dale rosenbloom regarding how to make a family film . shiloh , rosenbloom's first foray into the field of family entertainment , easily outclasses any live-action movie the mouseketeers have released in the last three or four years . here are some disney staples that shiloh has managed to avoid : plastic characters , ogre-like adults afflicted with terminal stupidity , moronic humor , pointless action sequences , and a nauseating overdose of cuteness . rosenbloom has remembered something that disney has forgotten : the key to fashioning good family entertainment is to make the movie enjoyable to everyone in the family , not just the five and six-year olds . will appreciate what rosenbloom has wrought with this low-key , thoughtful motion picture . he takes the time and effort to develop real , imperfect characters rather than recycling familiar types . i have never been a big fan of "" animal in danger "" tales , but shiloh is far better than most . not only does it show the animal , a one-year old beagle , being abused ( although not graphically ) , but it doesn't turn the dog into some sort of living cartoon character . and the film's villain , judd travers ( scott wilson ) , isn't just inherently evil -- there's a legitimate reason why he's so nasty , as marty comes to find out during the movie's second half . he even gives it a name -- shiloh -- after the bridge where he encountered it . the strength of shiloh is that it approaches its subject matter intelligently . the adults in shiloh are not one-dimensional . marty's dad , despite being somewhat domineering and old-fashioned , understands his son's affection for shiloh , and , to a degree , is willing to support him . everyone , from a veteran like rod steiger to a newcomer like blake heron , gives a heartfelt and believable performance . shiloh , which is adapted from a newberry award winning book , fits nicely into the class of better animal-related family films , joining the ranks of lassie and black beauty . and , while the primary target audience is undeniably children , few adults who sit through this motion picture will wish they had done otherwise . shiloh represents something that's all too rare at theaters these days : a pleasant surprise .

"as written by victor hugo , the 19th century classic novel les miserables is a long , sprawling epic that encompasses everything from the political upheaval of post-revolutionary france to the intimate orchestrations of the heart . over the years , millions of fans have come to admire jean valjean , the book's protagonist , who proves that a man can change , and to adore cosette , the one girl who captures his heart . considering the book's length , which easily exceeds 1000 pages ( it is probably the second-longest novel i have ever read ) , there's no way that a 135-minute motion picture can begin to capture its vast scope ( nor , for that matter , can a 3-plus hour popular musical ) . nevertheless , while screenwriter's rafael yglesias makes a host of significant cuts , he manages not only to capture the essence of les miserables' key theme -- redemption -- but also to faithfully render the characters as more than one-dimensional condensations of their literary inspirations . as brought to the screen by neeson , valjean is not only a grand , heroic figure , but a distinctly human individual as well , with frailties aplenty . geoffrey rush , as dislikable here as he was likable as david helfgott in shine , makes javert a memorable villain , but he avoids the obvious temptation of turning the inspector into a cartoonish bad guy . as valjean has his failings , so javert has his virtues , and there are many times when we pity him more than hate him . it's an obsession that blinds javert to all else , and consumes his entire life . none of the supporting actors come close to matching neeson's quiet intensity or rush's zeal . uma thurman is surprisingly effective as fantine , but she's on-screen for less than a quarter of the film . given to overacting her most emotionally-charged scenes , danes seems wrong for the part . hans matheson , playing her love interest , is rather bland , but he is handicapped by an underwritten part . the marius of the movie is a pale shadow of the marius of the book , and the screen version of the love story is far from captivating . marius often seems more like a plot device than a genuine character . directed by bille august , who was once hand-picked by ingmar bergman to helm the best intentions , les miserables is a gloriously rich , if flawed , drama . the two-plus hours fly by as we are captivated by the characters and their circumstances . despite being condensed from a novel that would take 20 hours to present in its entirety , the film rarely has the feel of being rushed . it progresses briskly , but in such a manner that we never lose sight of the two-pronged emotional core of the story : valjean's rivalry with javert and his deep , abiding love for cosette . this is not , of course , the first motion picture version of les miserables , but it is one of the better ones , with a streamlined script that doesn't have the uneven feel of many of its predecessors . there's little doubt that the popularity of the musical made it easier to finance the movie , but anyone expecting singing and dancing will be in for a shock . and , while this version of les miserables lacks the cleverness and contemporary spin evident in claude lelouch's brilliant 1995 re-interpretation , it is moving and effective in its own right , as a more "" straightforward "" adaptation . kudos to all involved for a finely-crafted period drama that delivers over two hours of solid , literate entertainment .

"winstanley is a truly amazing and painstaking account of misery , as it depicts those whose cause is righteous and nonviolent . the narrative is taken from the pamphlet writings of gerrard winstanley , a gentle , christian radical . he sort of resembles a hippie of the 1970s . the film is based on the book by david caute , "" comrade jacob , "" but has been thoroughly reworked by co-directors brownlow and mollo . his unique filming style , his penchant for austerity , his demand for authenticity , his equalizing of all scenes in importance so that no event sticks out from the others , and his inspired devotion toward looking at the past , perhaps hoping to unearth some missing piece in the puzzle of mankind that keeps the modern world from advancing on the past tragedies , gives this film an air of adventure . lacking the necessary dramatics of films that are more accessible to the general public , this film is nonetheless a work of great intrigue and visual beauty . despite being filmed without the benefit of professional actors , the only professional being jerome willis who played general fairfax , this film has a certain solemnity about it that forces its truths to be seen in the face of the actors . it is brownlow's way of filming such misery , a way that records the diggers' sufferings as if it were the official record of what happened , and probably could pass for what is official . this sense of reality is what gives the film its raw power . it's a lesson in history that is re-created from the words of a journal that allows the directors to look back at the past with a sense of reverence . this film acts as a vehicle to understand what the diggers believed and how they lived , and how they justly thought that the earth was made common property for everyone . that everyone born on earth shall be fed by it and that all are equals in the creation . his performance was beautiful . there is no question , this low budget project , the bfi put up seventeen thousand pounds , achieved the maximum in having an authentic look , even showing the rare breeds of animals , of the time . it showed breeds of pigs and chickens that don't exist today but did during the 17th century . the film's cost is about the same as a james bond film's title scene would cost . the film's cinematographer , ernest vincze , like almost everyone in the film , including the directors , worked for nothing . it doesn't pretend to have the answers , but the questions it raises about the ability of mankind to live and work together , is one worth asking . the message of the film might seem naive or confrontational to many , including the marxists , the bourgeoisie , the film critics looking for a more recognizable kind of film to evaluate , and the common man , bored by what he doesn't want to know . but to others , perhaps the more restless in society , not afraid of ideas , there is a freshness in this work that you can't easily shrug off by pointing to the filmmaker's refusal to be more melodramatic . the scenes were acted with conviction and its lack of hollywood type of poshness actually played to its favor , making the action seem more pertinent . their story is not something you can easily forget in the black-and- white framed shots , taken by a hand-held camera , and in their uncompromising idealism squaring off against self-righteous forces that wanted to crush them , afraid of their new visions for mankind . try comparing winstanley to other period films of the commercial variety , and it is hard not to see how much more real and meaningful this film is . if nothing else , at least , it is a hard film to forget . for the poetic dream of winstanley , for an equitable and more reasonable world , one that is not forged by malice and greed : that is a vision the world is still waiting to see actually happen . this film is available on video by milestone .

"say it isn't so ! is another comedic misfire produced by the farrelly brothers ( me , myself & irene ) . although there are a few good laughs in it , most of the film stays at the crudely unfunny level with jokes about a wife who uses her armpits to salt her husband's food and a guy who gets his arm stuck up a cow's anus . first-time director james b . rogers's next film is american pie ii . i can hardly wait . heather graham ( bowfinger ) is fairly wasted as jo since the script gives her little to do other than smile a lot with the intensity and honesty of a politician looking for votes . but -- surprise ! and , even bigger surprise , he really isn't . in the spirit of full disclosure , there were a couple of scenes that were so surprising and shocking that i did laugh loudly . it is the show and tell part of the meal that i found so funny . and finally , the ending is cute even if somewhat predictable . wait for video and keep your finger by the fast forward button . say it isn't so ! runs just 1 : 33 but feels longer . it is rated r for strong sexual content , crude humor and language and would be acceptable for older teenagers . just send me a letter with the word "" subscribe "" in the subject line .

"in addition , the script has a heavy autobiographical tinge -- cassavetes is using cinema to work out his ambiguous feelings towards his famous father . but mildred isn't destined to be alone for long . looking back on unhook the stars , the first thing that strikes me is the script's openness and honesty . it doesn't try to trick and manipulate us with melodrama . every action has a natural consequence -- nothing ever feels forced or scripted . is coming to a close , we're spared an emotional scene . unhook the stars is consistently low-key , and , in the context of an intelligent script and strong acting , this represents a welcome change-of-pace from most american films . gena rowlands is excellent , but that shouldn't come as a surprise . she becomes mildred , subtly and effectively bringing the woman's every emotion to the surface . this is the kind of role that could easily be overacted , but rowlands strikes the perfect balance between restraint and abandon . marisa tomei , who has always had screen presence , gives the best performance of a relatively short career . tomei makes monica a swirling , contradictory font of pure emotion -- she's always nervous , agitated , elated , furious , or a combination of the above . monica may not be the best-developed character , but tomei invests her with such passion and energy that it's impossible not to see her as a lot more than the person on the pages of cassavetes' screenplay . the young actress , the best thing about the recent entertaining angels , gives a powerhouse performance in limited screen exposure . annie's pain and rage are palpable , going far beyond the norms of youthful rebellion , and kelly realistically and effectively portrays them . unhook the stars is an engaging motion picture , mixing various flavors of comedy and drama into a satisfying whole . admittedly , there are times when cassavetes skims lightly over subject matter that is deserving of a fuller exploration , but the quality of the finished product allows us to overlook most of these incidents . unhook the stars is a movie of many special , small moments , that , combined together , make for a shining cinematic experience . -- ingmar bergman ",1,6.399274671969998e-143,0.999992427826,7.57217449055e-06
"let me start by saying that hercules , walt disney pictures' 35th animated feature , makes for good family entertainment . good , not great . while this film is capable of providing a ninety minute diversion for both kids and adults , it's a far cry from such recent classics as the little mermaid , beauty and the beast , and aladdin . a mere five years ago , disney was developing top-notch animated movies on a regular basis . now , in 1997 , the studio's efforts have become dull and routine . no one is pushing disney and revenue is up -- where's the incentive to stop the assembly-line animated feature production and get back to creative movie making ? hercules has the dubious distinction of being the least-enchanting cartoon disney has fashioned in over a decade . many of these are understandable , given the studio's espousal of family values . so , instead , disney has made hercules the divine offspring of a couple that represents olympian marital bliss : zeus and hera . the majority of the film centers on the adult hercules performing all sorts of grueling tasks to clean up the ancient city of thebes ( "" the big olive "" -- if you can make it there , you can make it anywhere ) and establish his status as a hero . hercules comes close to being a remake of the the little mermaid with a male hero . one could easily argue that all disney animated films are similar ( for example , the hero is always a loner who proves herself/himself through some deed of self-sacrifice ) , but hercules is a little too blatant in its cannibalization of past themes and plot points . besides that , this film has a distractingly episodic feel . instead of coming together as a cohesive story , it's like a bunch of thinly-related events strung one-by-one to reach a ninety-minute running time . the most disappointing aspect of hercules is the amateurish quality of the artwork . in fact , this approach makes the film look rushed and , at times , incomplete . it is never a visual marvel -- even the computer-generated scenes fail to impress . the sequences intended to offer the biggest spectacle -- olympus and the underworld -- provoke little more than a yawn . with hercules , composer alan menken is scoring his sixth animated disney feature . however , the songs for last year's hunchback of notre dame were generic and lifeless , and there's little sign of improvement here . simply put , this is a boring soundtrack . on the other hand , hercules' vocal characterizations are uniformly good . joshua keaton and tate donovan team up effectively as the title character . rip torn makes for a nicely authoritative zeus . but the real star of the show is james woods , whose hades is the most vibrant disney creation since robin williams' genie . hades is a lively villain with a great repertoire of one-liners . and , although woods isn't as much of a vocal chameleon as williams , he's close enough that it hardly matters . hercules is saturated with cultural references -- points should be awarded for anyone who spots them all . most amusing of all , however , is the way hercules willingly lampoons its own reputation , taking several jabs at the inevitable merchandising whirlwind that surrounds its release . so , although hercules is undoubtedly one of the summer's most lightly enjoyable motion pictures , i couldn't shake the feeling that it could have been and done more . those on the lookout for another disney masterpiece won't uncover it here . however , anyone with the modest goal of finding a screen solution to the problem of a family outing need not worry : disney's 35th animated motion picture fills the prescription .

"director : pat o'connor . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , nudity ) running time : 108 minutes . voice-over narration is a common cinematic device , particularly in nostalgic period films , yet i can think of few narrated films in the last thirty years which wouldn't have been better without it . narration tends to be a crutch , an attempt by a film-maker to be more "" literary "" which instead suggests that he lacks the patience to reveal the characters' psychology without short-cuts . inventing the abbotts is a pleasant period drama for a while , until the episodic story grinds to a halt as the actors sit around waiting for the narrator to tell us how they feel . the opening half-hour of inventing the abbotts is by far its best , energized by the awkwardness and buzzing hormones of its teen-aged principal characters . it is jennifer connelly's funny , sexy and sly performance as eleanor which provides the real spark to the first act of abbotts , her every scene punctuated by a wicked smile , a glimpse of underwear ( her own ) or a grab of the crotch ( not her own ) . then , thirty minutes into the film , connelly is banished from the narrative , and the whole production goes into a stupor trying to figure out what its about . there are really two separate plot-lines in inventing the abbotts -- jacey's attempts to live vicariously through the abbotts and doug's off-and-on romance with pamela -- but once connelly is out of the picture , the episodic story is sluggish and rarely involving . the single predominant reason for that lack of involvement is the narration , provided by an uncredited michael keaton to underline the action whenever and wherever possible . it becomes ever more obtrusive as the film moves along , first providing merely background information but eventually announcing the motivations of every character . it is the narrator who tells us how jacey _really_ feels about alice , not billy crudup's performance ; it is the narrator who make sure we understand how wonderful mrs . holt is , not the interactions between the characters . and , as though aware that they are under no obligation to convey their emotions through anything as mundane as acting , the actors simply don't bother . joaquin phoenix and liv tyler -- who needs to learn a different emotional shade before she's too old to play "" the virgin "" -- make a perfectly nice couple , but neither delivers a personality . both are pleasant to look at , and they might as well be modeling for still photographs . given the way fox has marketed inventing the abbotts to focus on its "" hot young stars , "" it's not unreasonable to think of them as models in a story . it's not that they can't act ; they're simply not given much of a chance to do more than look as warm and inviting as the 1950s suburban middle-america director pat o'connor ( circle of friends ) creates . the audience isn't given much of a chance either , which ultimately may explain more of my dissatisfaction with inventing the abbotts . as artfully made and sensitively plotted as it might be , inventing the abbotts ends up insulting the audience with its over-reliance on narration . tv's "" the wonder years "" became a parody of itself when daniel stern piped up every forty seconds or so to clarify significant details which required absolutely no clarification , and that's the way inventing the abbotts feels after 108 minutes . when narration makes a film feel more lazy than literary , as happens in inventing the abbotts , it's time to shut up and follow the old writer's rule : show , don't tell .

"sometimes , it's impossible not to contemplate what a motion picture could have been , had a few things about it been different . often , especially for very good or very bad movies , the changes will make little difference . however , in the case of the house of the spirits , which is a worthy effort as it stands , certain alterations ( not all of which would have been simple to execute ) might have transformed this into a devastating film . alas , deficiencies rob the picture of a share of its impact , limiting the ultimate emotional appeal and power of bille august's adaptation of isabel allende's novel . the house of the spirits is driven by its complex and many-faceted plot , not by the characters that populate the film . the story moves along at a rapid pace , sometimes glossing over the more trivial events that might have bolstered the substance of the protagonists . events fly by as fast as the decades , with political activities gaining importance as the movie races towards its conclusion . many of the characters , both major and minor , are little more than ciphers for a certain point-of-view or belief . even jeremy irons' esteban remains relatively undeveloped until well into the second half , when events conspire to re-mould his previously intransigent personality , lending it depth and dimension . meryl streep's clara is one of the few characters to be well-rounded from the start , although even in her case , there is unplumbed territory--her odd psychic powers are only occasionally brought into use , and then as minor plot devices , when so much more could have been formed from that raw material . winona ryder is given perhaps her most difficult role to date , and carries it off with aplomb . in addition to that of ms . ryder , the best performances are given by ms . close , ms . streep , and mr . irons ( although it becomes something of an annoyance trying to pin down what esteban's accent is supposed to be ) . perhaps director august was constrained by running time , but his latest project shows little of the careful examination of character that his two most celebrated films--pelle the conqueror and the best intentions--exhibit . in fact , the house of the spirits is in many ways the antithesis of the best intentions . while the latter was a slow-moving piece that allowed its participants time to grow and breathe , this new film seems at times constrained and cramped . regardless of its flaws , however , the house of the spirits is an engrossing motion picture . it doesn't capitulate with the "" hollywood mentality "" that demands a complete ending , willing instead to risk something open-ended . the story attains a momentum of its own that sweeps the viewer along until the end . this movie is one-hundred forty- two minutes long , but could easily have been double that , had the screenplay demanded it . at its best , the house of the spirits interweaves the very personal story of its main characters with the turbulent political backdrop which frames their actions . bille august has done a fine job with isabel allende's tale , crafting a captivating motion picture , but it's hard not to recognize the flaws , and wonder about the lost potential .

"i'll be honest with you : the last thing i was expecting from the paramount-distributed trekkies was a warts-n-all documentary about "" star trek "" fandom . roger nygard's trekkies , however , is about as far from an officially endorsed whitewash as one could imagine . in fact , though its character studies are at times undeniably amusing , it's almost too focused on turning its subjects into the oddballs everyone already suspects trekkies of being . the bad news for many "" trek "" fans expecting a sympathetic portrait is that those two characters are among the more mainstream folks in the film . when the subject matter swerves into the pornographic fan fiction which has been created using "" trek "" characters , it no longer feels like nygard is just creating a comprehensive catalog of the manifestations of trekkie-ism . there's an element of side show exploitation to these aspects of trekkies , a sense that nygard is less interested in understanding the phenomenon of trekkies than in turning their eccentricities into punch lines . that's truly a shame , because the "" why's "" of trekkies could have been at least as fascinating as the "" who's "" . in an utterly unique way , the universe created by gene roddenberry affected viewers as no other television program has in the history of the medium . trekkies also touches on the impact of the show's positive portrayal of multi-ethnic integration , and on the optimism of its messages of inclusion and acceptance . such ideas should have made it easier to see trekkies as social outsiders who have embraced a mythology in which they are tolerated , and even celebrated . it's ironic -- and somewhat disappointing -- to watch the film turn them into social outsiders once again . there's no denying that trekkies is occasionally quite funny , whether in the answers of cast members to the strangest fan experiences they have had , or in the ways various trekkies have integrated their love of "" trek "" into their lives ( like dentist dennis bourguignon's "" starbase dental "" office ) . it was only after i left the theater that i realized i had been laughing at these people more than i was laughing with them . yes , there are comments about how intelligent most "" star trek "" fans are ; it's too bad they feel like token gestures . many trekkies themselves seem to have embraced the film , but i'm not sure they should appreciate the way they are turned into exactly what the broader population generally thinks of them . there's not enough balance between the unusual things these people do and the love that inspires them to do those things . it was brave of paramount to endorse a film like trekkies . it also seems like a bit of a betrayal . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"it doesn't have to be peeping through a bedroom window or watching a couple making love through a telescope . the seductive power of voyeurism is the knowledge that you're watching something real--not acted or scripted--and the players in the drama have no idea they're under scrutiny . it's addictive , and those hooked on it can become more involved in living the lives of others than their own . while the book is not a psychological or artistic milestone , it makes for compulsive page-turning . the story is entertaining and focused ( until the end ) , and the characters seem real . in the decisions made to turn the novel into a movie , all of that was lost . in the movie , voyeurism is a plot device in a script that goes nowhere and whose effete and implausible resolution leaves 50% of the audience's questions unanswered . if we really cared about the movie or its poorly developed characters , this might be a blow , but sliver is so badly put together that its abrupt conclusion is likely to provoke little response . personally , i don't have a problem with a movie changing the story of the book from which it has been adapted , as long as the changes are sensible and effective . the strengths of the original story are muted and the weaknesses magnified . the ending is nowhere to be found , and what appears in the movie is so disjointed and contradictory that it leaves the viewer feeling cold and cheated . because of writer eszterhas and actress stone , comparisons with basic instinct are unavoidable . actually , any similarities are superficial . there's a lot of nudity ( but no icepicks ) and a few deaths but , aside from eszterhas' often-embarrassing dialogue , the two films aren't that close . as if it isn't bad enough that the script needs a major re-write , this lackluster production suffers from other problems . sharon stone , who was effective as the femme fatale of basic instinct , shows a lack of aptitude in playing the woman-in-distress . her emotional range in sliver is limited and she fails to generate much sympathy . william baldwin's portrayal is too bland for a character with the depth of passion and emotion that zeke is supposed to have . tom berenger puts a great deal of energy into what is essentially a thankless role ( his character isn't in the book ) , but little that we see or learn about jack landsford makes much sense . the gem in the rough of sliver is polly walker ( the spoiled heiress of enchanted april , who phillip noyce also directed in patriot games ) , although she's on-screen for too few scenes . production-wise , sliver has the look and feel of something from mtv . the incidental music is intrusive and the quick-cuts are distracting . with the movie's focus on video , it's odd that the visuals are so pedestrian . there is also a sense of heavy editing . at least one scene referred to explicitly has been cut out . with thrillers , it's difficult to say who will like what . certainly , those who are looking for a good whodunnit won't find it in sliver . equally displeased with this film will be the moviegoer looking for a fast-paced film . even those who loved basic instinct may be disappointed--sliver has little of the tension and relentless energy that marked verhoeven's 1992 movie . all-in-all , there's little here to please anyone , and those who loved levin's book are bound to leave the theater disgusted .

"there is nothing quite as sad for someone who loves movies as watching a rookie film-maker who really wants to say something , but turns out not to have very much to say , or appears unable to say it in a way that connects . she has a sundance institute-approved screenplay , and all the studied quirkiness she can fit into 89 minutes . but krueger has created a predictable story with characters who still look like they exist on 3x5 notecards on her desk . manny & lo is a comedy-drama without enough of either . i suppose one of the things which irritated me most about manny & lo is that for an ostensibly original independent film , its basic premise has been done and done and done again . as comedy , think of ruthless people ; as social drama , think of last year's white man's burden . and those are just recent examples of stories which make the very psych 101 observation that kidnapers and their hostages aren't always so different , and sometimes bond to fulfill their respective needs . manny & lo doesn't offer much of a twist on the movie truism that if the plot is about a kidnapping , abductors and abducted will go from antagonism to uneasy truce to friendship . there wasn't a moment when i didn't know exactly where krueger was taking me . mary kay place , a much more experienced performer , turns elaine into something intriguing almost in spite of krueger . i think there is a tendency to give first-timers the benefit of the doubt on independent projects like this , because critics are usually aware of the limitations of time and money . i'm not sure that any of that matters to the audience . lisa krueger's intentions are good ; she wants to explore what can make a dysfunctional family functional , and how whether or not you perceived your family as dysfunctional can determine the effect it has on you . she also leaves threads dangling , introduces characters who do little or nothing to advance the story ( like cameron boyd as the terribly cute chuck , who hands out his signature to manny ) , and doesn't direct her script with an eye to making either the humor or the relationships as effective as they might have been . manny & lo is a slow , rather simple and not terribly entertaining film , and that doesn't change because krueger is inexperienced , or a woman , or not working for a major studio .

"a couple of years ago , i began reading scott smith's novel a simple plan and never made it to the halfway point . there was nothing particularly wrong with the plot -- a moody cautionary tale about the resulting spiral of guilt and violence when three men find $4 . 4 million in a wrecked plane -- nor did smith's prose style offend in any way . it seemed to me a terrible mistake , one made identification with one specific character too explicit . intriguing though the premise may have been , i couldn't get past hearing hank mitchell's voice while watching his story unfold . sam raimi's screen version of a simple plan shows how easy it can be to improve on a novel when point-of-view is its only real flaw . only there is harm done . a simple plan offers an object lesson in any number of cliched moral bon mots : crime doesn't pay , there certainly isn't any honor among thieves , and love of money is indeed the root of all evil . it's a tale of what we're made of at our core , and how little it takes to strip away the civilization in a man like hank and turn him into a savage . that probably doesn't sound like the kind of material one usually associates with raimi ( the evil dead , darkman ) , a director whose camera often seems to need a dose of ritalin . he certainly tones down his hyperkinetic visuals , but he loses none of his energy , which is why a simple plan never feels like a simplistic morality play . he merely harnesses that energy into scenes of superbly crafted tension , where the moments before critical decisions linger with almost unbearable anticipation . raimi allows you to feel the weight of every bad choice , every life-threatening turning point . it's a thriller as full of genuine dread as anything a major studio has produced in recent years . it's also a thriller full of genuine pathos , thanks to a masterful supporting performance by billy bob thornton . as confused as he is physically grotesque , he provides the sense of emotional consequence most plot-driven thrillers lack . the one drawback to thornton's intense work is that he makes his castmates look weak by comparison ; bridget fonda's calculating sarah rings particularly false at times . a simple plan overreaches its grasp a bit during the final act when a sinister figure arrives to threaten the plan , but by then raimi and smith have gotten you so wrapped up in what their characters will do next that you're willing to follow wherever they lead . smith's first-person narrative in written form made this a tale of one man's descent . on the screen , a simple plan lets you identify with every character and experience the chilly , chilling dark night of several souls . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"there is something about this chic look at modern english society- one that is filled with wanton sex , drugs , and violence- that is more frightening than all the mayhem , perversities , muggings , and rapes it shows on screen . i think that something has to do with the fear we have of trusting the young people depicted in the film with the future of the country . the film is shot in such pleasingly stylish colors , especially the orange background , whereby the film gets its title from . it is so visually splendid a film , that it is shameful that we are confronted with so much violence , as it seems that even the violence as presented and choreographed is all too entertaining for the grim message it is trying to deliver . one might be beguiled into expecting a musical film to be taking place , if one were not aware that kubrick was the director . sex is the old in-and-out thing ; if they want an auto they just steal it , and for someone they don't like , they just pummel them . there is a strong enough reaction to these things to induce a nausea in him . kubrick's look at society is an unduly pessimistic one . there is something evil in society , but what to do about it , that is the question that remains . at least , for kubrick , we better think about what we are doing to ourselves , before it is too late . the most frightening part of the film , was that all the extremes of violence and cultural debasement , are pretty close to what the norms of society actually are . i was left feeling unsure of how to take the film's message . was there a moral ambiguity exhibited toward the violence ? there just doesn't seem to be much to think about as alternatives to the way the problem youth was handled . the film adaption from anthony burgess' satiric novel , results in a pure kubrick over-indulgent , brilliantly visual and graphic film . the jargonistic language used ( called nadsat- an onomatopoetic combination of english , russian , and slang ) made for a most arresting film , one that can't be put aside without thinking about what kind of impact it makes on how we view such moral and ethical problems . but i just don't think we come away knowing anything more about what to do about these problems than before seeing the film . nevertheless , i did find it to be a visual joyride , something that is terrifyingly pertinent in an eerie sort of way ; a memorable film , one that has become ingrained in our culture and must be looked upon as one of those 'important' films that one should see . i just didn't think it reached the level of some of his other masterpieces ( 2001 , paths of glory , the killing , eyes wide shut , and dr . strangelove ) , that , for me , were on more solid intellectual footing .

"" one story , about a woman with a wet poodle and a microwave , is thrown in as the story's only real joke . the script is especially good at not telegraphing which stories have legs and which end almost before they begin . even the most minor of these incidents are staged with such creepy class that they become quite intriguing . it's the sort of film in which even innocuous phrases such as , "" don't forget to set your clock back , "" manage to have dark , ominous portents . the crisp editing by randolph bricker and ed marx keeps us on our toes as images sometimes flash by like a hit-and-run and others times linger to haunt us . and shane kelly's cinematography captures the mood almost too well . nightmares after this film are definitely possible , not so much for what happens as for the movie's raw intensity . "" just give me a second to figure out the ending , "" charlie tells us at the opening of the movie . the biggest disappointment for me was that urbania doesn't really have an ending . and for adventuresome moviegoers , urbania takes us through a fascinating night when danger is definitely in the air . urbania runs a little long at 1 : 43 .

"first-time film director and former music video director spike jonze has come up with a tantalizing feast for the self to nosh on , cooked by charles kaufman's original screenplay , that offers up some very intangible delicacies on its plate , such as a psychological , personal and sexual identity study , allowing the eater to suspend belief about what is being digested and be allowed to tastefully enter into the mind of another being . it is a playful and provocative look at determining one's identity and how celebrity is viewed from within , featuring an actual celebrity , the performer , john malkovich , who is playing himself , as the mind who is being entered . if someone could market via virtual reality how to actually do that , it might cost as much as $200 for a 15 minute sightseeing trip down that path , the charge established in the film for such a trip , while for the movie viewer it is only for the nominal cost of a movie ticket that one gets to have such a unique experience . the running gag being , that the overhead and the rent are also low here . since the glimpse into malkovich's head is more or less fictional , it's delightfully funny to find craig turning up inside the man's head and to find the actor eating toast and reading the wall street journal in his park avenue apartment . the film was brilliant in spots but towards the end ran out of enough nourishing food to sustain its steady diet of farcical comedy . but even as it was petering out , it still managed to have enough brilliant glimpses at celebrity and how some crave that sort of identity , to make it both hilarious and somewhat intellectually appealing , and leave off with an ending that is unnerving . what makes this insane premise work out so surprisingly well , is that the actors get the joke and run with it , even flushing out seemingly irrelevant things about one's inner being along the way that are fun to scrutinize . and if anything more can be said about john malkovich than that he is a grand actor , it is that he comes across as a good person , someone with a good sense of humor and someone who is able to heartily have a laugh at himself even if it is supposedly at his own expense . this is the kind of strange film that one would expect to be released as an art-house indie , yet here it is playing as a mainstream big production .

"director : frederik duchau . mpaa rating : g ( some scary action ) running time : 80 minutes . there are plenty of good reasons why i try to write reviews as soon as possible after seeing a film . some are purely practical , like the deadlines that stack up one against the other as friday release-date approaches ; some are philosophical , like the desire not to be influenced by any other opinions i might hear . quest for camelot has provided me with yet another reason , perhaps the best yet -- when you're dealing with a film as hopelessly bland as this one , you'll be lucky if you can remember a single detail 48 hours later . and i do mean "" blah . "" quest for camelot is one of the most ennervated animated films in recent memory , a lifeless conglomeration of elements each more instantly forgettable than the last . visually , it offers uninspired settings and lackluster character design until the appearance of a nifty computer-generated ogre . the comic relief isn't much of a relief at all , serving up a volley of pop culture pot shots ( taxi driver , dirty harry , friday the 13th , superman ) , banal bickering between the dragon's two heads and cringe-inducing voice casting like bronson pinchot and jaleel white . of course we also need to have songs , which means a truly awful bunch of david foster/carol bayer sager compositions alternating between middle-of-the-road piffle and soporific show-stoppers . director frederik duchau can't even manage to get his voice talent to sound vaguely enthusiastic ; brosnan reads the legendary king of the britons as though he needs a prozac far more than he needs excalibur . quest for camelot's story seems well-intentioned enough , empowering its misfit heroes despite the various obstacles to success they face . unfortunately , that's about all the story offers . the film moves with a deadening listlessness , as duchau bungles the few genuine bits of action with bizarre decisions like scoring a tense chase scene to the big love ballad . the choice of elwes as the voice of kayley's guide through the forest proves to be a huge mistake , reminding viewers familiar with the princess bride of westley's infinitely more engaging romantic adventures through the fire swamp with buttercup . eventually , the failure of the rest of the story makes even the empowerment message annoying , playing like an anachronistic scolding of the round table for including only fully-abled white male humans . as i vainly searched for something to hold my attention , i kept noticing the children in the theater wandering up and down the aisles , or engaged in conversations far more lively than anything on the screen . i can't imagine why a parent would subject their children to being bored silly by a film like quest for camelot , especially when adults will probably be bored even sillier . then again , i suppose there would be a bright side : two days later , they'll never even remember what they had to sit through . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"sternberg had a different vision for the film and after the opening chaotic scenes were told like a straight crime story , the director changed the reality of the silent film and abandoned hecht's version . sternberg gave this film a blend of realism , german expressionism and hollywood sentimentality . this works out fine , as bull is even more successful than before and becomes the uncrowned king of the chicago underworld . bull was portrayed as a burly , physical man with complex emotions . he always wanted to elevate feathers in stature and enjoyed doing it in a crass way , as he gave her jewelry as presents . that he could be generous as well as ruthless and had a laugh that could fill a room with his giant personality , made him a villain who was not one-dimensional . during its time this was an edgy film , but the times have changed and its story doesn't hold up as well today . it's a film that is mostly interesting for its historical contribution to cinema , as it set the conventions for this genre . it is also a visually challenging film , as sternberg filled the screen with symbols and imagery it had never seen before . this changed the way gangster films were made , and the visuals of this film are still considered to be innovative and stylish . some critics have classified this as an example of film noir mainly because of all the alienation and corruption shown . it's not like the film noir of the 1940s , but more like a noir predecessor . interestingly enough , at the first academy awards ceremony in 1929 , the film received its only award , for story writer ben hecht .

"for approximately five minutes , the computer-animated dinosaur is undeniably spectacular . the story creeps up without dialogue , following the fate of one little dinosaur egg from its trampled , abandoned nest across an astonishing primeval landscape . seven years removed from the revolutionary screen creations of jurassic park , i didn't think it would be possible for the mere sight of digital dinosaurs to seize the imagination , but it happens in dinosaur nonetheless . with its entirely visual storytelling , dinosaur's prologue offers a giddiness-inducing prospect : an introduction to a lost world as quietly , primally engrossing as kubrick's "" dawn of man "" prologue to 2001 : a space odyssey . and then a cute little simian opens its stupid mouth . i knew going into dinosaur that it was a disney film aimed at kids , so i can't say i was expecting anything more profound than the story it ultimately provided . that didn't make its presence any less disappointing . yaaaaaaawwn . disney's animated features have generally been pretty formulaic , so it's no shock to discover that dinosaur features a by-the-numbers script . this variation , however , is so relentlessly somber and dreary that there's nothing left but formula . the personalities of the principal characters are so bland and the vocal performances so uninspired that the characters threaten to disappear into the backgrounds -- no small feat considering the overwhelming brown-ness of the desolate post-apocalyptic scenery . even the minor characters like zini and eema -- those theoretically present to provide a little comic relief -- can't inject any life into the film . in recent disney films , the musical numbers have come off as purely obligatory , but i found myself pleading for a snappy tune to breathe some life into the film . it's hard to imagine what young viewers would find to embrace in this grim production , and even harder to imagine what would keep an adult awake . there's no denying that the technology involved in the creation of dinosaur is extraordinary , mixing the computerized cast with some real-world settings so seamlessly that it's virtually impossible to tell where reality and hard drive overlap . apparently , however , co-director ralph zondag has become no more adept at dinosaur-driven storytelling than he was for the limp 1993 animated feature we're back ! that film seemed rushed into theaters to capitalize on that summer's jurassic juggernaut . this one misses its opportunity to step out of the spielbergian shadow , gradually devolving into a series of all-too-familiar set pieces . that's a sad end to a film that begins with so much promise . better to recycle disney's orphan fetish without a whiff of personality or humor , its early grandeur slowly but steadily fading into extinction . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"the film looks at the changes in vietnam since 1945 . it is a gentle film that uses the viewpoint of a buddhist nun to tell the story . the film opens in hue in 1985 , but it jumps back to 1945 and then works its way forward . director ho quang minh ( white page and karma ) sets a tone so subtle and lifeless that it borders on catatonia . a few times soldiers will come through and fire a few rounds , and sometimes there are gunshots in the background ; but most scenes are dark and inanimate . typical ones have two characters in shadows talking lowly . rarely is the script by nguy ngu and ho quang minh involving . the film's pace is excruciatingly slow . there is one beautiful sequence in the picture of a buddhist meal . it is choreographed so that every movement is synchronized and in perfect harmony . the flaw of the scene is that the editor lets it go on way too long so that charm eventually gives way to tedium . perhaps the single biggest problem with the film is the actors , who do little more than read their lines . none of them show any emotion , and their characters become stick figures . there is a tinge of emotion in the end , but little in the rest of the picture . gone , gone , forever gone starts with a good premise , but the director is unable to craft a compelling motion picture from it . it is in vietnamese with english subtitles . it is not rated , but would probably be pg for the little bit of shooting . kids would probably have to be nine or ten to be interested , but the show is acceptable for kids of any age . i found the film too boring to be able to recommend it . i give it * 1/2 . if you want to see a stronger entry for this year's best foreign film , check out my review of kolya which won the golden globe . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : january 25 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"i guess there are some concepts that don't excel in the translation from the small screen to the big one , and mystery science theater 3000 appears to be among these . the tv series , which started on a minneapolis uhf channel in 1988 before moving to hbo's comedy channel in 1989 , provides light , undemanding entertainment for those who enjoy lampooning ( or , perhaps more appropriately , harpooning ) bad movies . this new motion picture incarnation , which boasts larger sets but essentially the same format , is on par with one of the lesser episodes . as a tv diversion , mst3k is thoroughly enjoyable , but , in this new medium , it's something of a disappointment . for those unfamiliar with the mst3k premise , it goes something like this : a dastardly mad scientist , dr . forrester ( trace beaulieu ) , has decided to conquer the world by subjecting the entire population to bad movies . instead of being tortured into submission , however , these three actually seem to enjoy the experience . episode-after-episode , they sit in the audience and mock whatever "" cinematic suppository "" forrester exhibits . as viewers , we see a movie screen showing the picture of choice with a row of seats and three moving heads silhouetted against it . for mst3k : the movie , the film-to-be-savaged is this island earth , a 1954 science fiction embarrassment that could hold its own against any other entries in the worst movie of all time competition . a significant problem with using a movie this deliciously bad is that the film generates enough unintentional humor on its own , so it doesn't really need the quips and barbs from servo , mike , and crow . although a number of their comments are very funny , this island earth would have had me doubled over with laughter had i seen it without the mst3k format . unfortunately , during the course of this film , there are several contrived breaks that get the characters out of the darkened theater . during these sequences , without a cheesy flick to inspire them , their banter comes across as juvenile . such unnecessary and pointless padding dilutes the movie's better aspects . die-hard fans will undoubtedly be delighted , but it's more difficult to determine how casual viewers will react , especially if they realize that they're paying for something that's no better than what's available on tv . in fact , the theatrical environment may stifle mst3k , unless you happen to see it in a rocky horror picture show setting . by its nature , mst3k demands audience participation -- something difficult to obtain in a typical movie-watching environment . in general , it's easy to praise the ingenuity of the mst3k writers , although less for this script than for some of what they have previously accomplished . in this case , however , mst3k : the movie is routine -- sporadically funny , occasionally clever , but routine nonetheless .

"" even the magnificent , maleficent cruella is not safe from the onslaught of indignities , falling first into a vat of molasses and then into a pile of manure . it is a sign of hughes's love affair with "" america's funniest home videos "" humor that he replaces the original's most memorable suspense sequence -- the puppies' attempt to slip past cruella disguised as black labradors -- and replaces it with a scene in a barn which ends with a pig landing on cruella's chest . glenn close has obvious fun as cruella , playing her as an imperious drag queen , but i'm mystified by raves for her performance . there is no doubt that close can be scary -- she scared a generation of married men into zipping up their pants in fatal attraction -- but there is no malevolence in her characterization of cruella . disney's great villains were real threats , and they didn't take pratfalls ; cruella has horace and jasper so that _they_ can be the comic relief while she spooks the little ones . close cuts a fine figure in cruella's outrageous outfits and commanding some impressive sets , and she is about as intimidating as rupaul . then there are those adorable puppies . there is no point arguing that kids and many adults won't enjoy the frolicking dalmatians , because they will . there are a few marvelously trained animals in 101 dalmatians , and they provide some amusing moments . you could also get the same reaction out of most kids if you sat them down in front of a home movie of puppies playing , or an old episode of "" those amazing animals , "" or even a westminster dog show on espn2 , because reaction to the dogs in 101 dalmatians is not based on any kind of plot requiring individual personality for the animal characters . though the same kind of animatronic critters used in babe are used in 101 dalmatians , the animals don't talk here . not only does that make for some confusing narrative ( one scene found several kids around me perplexed as to why lucky was still in danger ) , but it makes the canine cast of 101 dalmatians little more than a big spotted blur . a certain kind of manipulative drama has long been called a "" tear-jerker , "" and 101 dalmatians is the family film equivalent . it's an "" awww-jeker , "" trotting out the adorable little puppies and having them yap at you until you begin to consider turning them into a coat yourself .

"it stridently shows in its futuristic prediction what the united states might become like if the reactionary right-wing had their way . it is a polemic exercise between the left and the right , with no room for the middle point of view . though the director tries to present some of the establishments' arguments against these young dissenters to show that he is impartial , the weight of what is going down is so heavy , that even when the tribunal members make a plausible response , it still sounds vacuous given the current situation . they mostly say things like the protesters don't care about this country , that the vietnam war is a "" just "" war because it is aimed to stop the spread of communism , and that the protesters are trying to make a mockery of the american way of life . that the politician is nothing but a debater . while the pacifists' say that war is only just when it is entered into without any hatred in one's heart . the honorable thing to do at a crisis time like this , is be a criminal -- that at another time it might be to become a politician . the film had a gritty look to it and should bring back some of the worst confrontational memories of a time the country was divided in a very hostile way . what was missing from the film , was a sense that it could accomplish anything . but , maybe , that wasn't possible , especially looking at this film some thirty years later and realizing how there was no way to justify the war and the racism at the time . to add to that the fictional suspension of individual rights and a horror chamber like punishment park , makes this film seem like a futile diatribe that lost its prospective of what its aim was . yet , if the film's polemics disturbs , but fails to entertain as a film , it still had some bite in it , and its non-professional cast made this an unusual film , one worth watching for all the intensity it displayed despite its inability to alter any one's mind from their current views . it is , simply , preaching to the choir .

""" it's like 'gone with the wind' on mescaline . "" most critics have their least favorite genres . one of mine is the movie whose appeal derives solely from a string of extremely quirky characters . conversely , one of my favorites is the courtroom drama . the former genre is extremely prevalent whereas the latter has fallen somewhat out of favor . the few courtroom dramas that are released are all too often mediocre . since the film contains both a murder trial and a host of eccentric characters , i went in excited but with reservations . although the movie , directed by clint eastwood , is not as good as i'd hoped , it is a delicious satire on the south . as a native southerner , i found the accents true , the culture believable , and the jokes dead-on . the beauty of john lee hancock's script is the fine line he walks between realism and parody . although eastwood comments in the press notes on how impressed he was with the way hancock boiled a complex book down to its essence , more pruning still would have improved the final product . paul hipp , for example , plays an inconsequential character named joe odom , whose whole part could and should have been expunged . as john kelso , john cusack gives another great performance . unlike his wonderful acting in grosse pointe blank , where he provided the humor , in midnight in the garden of good and evil he spends his time in reaction shots . as one of the almost completely comical characters in the show , lady chablis plays herself . she gets some hilarious one-liners , and she has a gift for physical comedy that keeps the show from ever dragging when she is on the screen .

"it succeeds mostly in being a visceral experience and for those who like to see brad pitt' pecs and how edward norton squirms when beaten up , and be bemused to hear helena bonham carter complain that the boys sure love their violence more than they do sex . the film eventually knocks itself out from hitting itself so much in the "" old "" noggin without really damaging its unspecified opponent-- society as a whole . the sheer nonsense of its storyline causes that knockout by relying on a ridiculous metaphor to make its point , too much glitter , and pitt' and norton' overacting ; what results is a jarring experience , enough to make you think without thinking that being sado-masochistic is the way to achieve respect ( it doesn't matter if this is meant to be a parody reflecting the violence in america : the violence is the thing in this story that the audience will remember most about this film ) . it succeeds in this venture only as a disturbing film , which makes the provocative assertion that those who are self-absorbed and mindless and go over-the-edge by doing violent acts are supposedly looking for hidden meanings in their life , which are given to them by false prophets , something that is happening currently in america to a great extent . but this film is too stilted , unconvincing , and inane to be the messenger delivering a warning about such dangers in society . but if its comedy that it is after , then it has some success in meeting those expectations , as the stars were able to project themselves into this story with enough animation to give the film a titillating lift . the more we get to know about the engaging soap salesman who is selling not only soap but a nihilistic philosophy , the more we learn how depraved he is . human lives are not part of this equation . a homo-erotic edge to their relationship is also hinted at , but like everything in this film , it is only superficially covered . the narrator suffers from insomnia , probably caused by his non-meaningful life . the utterly depraved tyler , exhibiting the ability to be a leader , with a need to offer sanctimonious maxims against the emptiness of materialism , such as , "" you are not your job , "" and the irresolute narrator , who is someone crying out for help and who is also someone ripe for being brainwashed . that all this is supposed to be funny is a matter of taste , though i think it is funny in a juvenile sort of way , where bad taste rules the day . the humor is catered to those who like their laughs coming to them shock treatment style . their alienation from society , supposedly , relates to those in the audience who also feel powerless about all the violence taking place in the country and now will have been amply warned by the filmmaker not to follow charismatic leaders and join cults that offer easy solutions to their problems , which should give the film a conventional reason for being made . the problem with the film's message , is that it comes via a film that is relying on the excesses of violence to put over its exploitive story , and then , to have this filmmaker be the voice of reason , is almost enough to make the average citizen who is concerned about the recent shootings in america's schools and the other sensational newsworthy violent acts , wonder what to make of this film , or to just barf at this outlandishly childish attempt to answer some very serious problems in such a mindlessly simple way . the fatuous simplicity the film offers for linking america's penchant for violence and sex , with the peoples' lack of fulfillment from meaningful jobs , is too much of a generality to be taken seriously . this response to what has gone wrong with the american dream is just as banal and wrong-headed a response , as those who would blame films such as this one for america's problems . at some point in the film , probably as soon as the fight club was started by tyler teaching the nerd how to fight and the club was then expanded into franchises across the country and evolved into a secret society of mayhem , the film stopped being smart and turned into a pointless nonsensical venture , that is not serious enough to take seriously , except it should be complimented for its imaginative visual style and kinetic energy it shows . the film's undercurrent philosophical sub theme stated by tyler , that "" it's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything , "" is an alluring one . if that were developed further along in the storyline , then there would be some intellectual challenges to a film that tries very hard to be nihilistic but fails miserably to make a cogent case for that belief or whatever it is trying to say , such as the drivel about this being a film about freeing the masculine soul from the shackles of a consumer society . i didn't fall under brad pitt' spell as easily as edward norton and helena bonham carter did , and therefore was not in a receptive mood for how the film was finally resolved . for me , this was a lightweight film that mistakingly thinks it's in the heavyweight class . what it offers for philosophy , is similar to the kind of superficial sound bites the tv news might offer to comment on its headline stories , as the news people seem to always play it safe and never take a radical position on the events they cover . what the film offers as philosophy is pseudo-philosophy , for a story that is more steeped in violence than interested in understanding its ramifications in a consumer society . it is just too easy to be against the fascists and the yuppies , and the emptiness of their materialistic lives . exploring that avenue , and not getting bogged down in showing another escapist violent film , might have been a more radical route to have gone down . it was very hard for me to see this unconventional mainstream film as anything more than a film that showed promise and had a lot of zip to it , but was disappointing in its scope . . . and . . . was certainly not a radical film .

"before i do the written equivalent of tearing this film into shreds and dumping the remains where they belong , i'll be honest enough to admit that boys around the age of ten seemed to enjoy rookie of the year very much . the movie is clean enough to be considered a family film , although i doubt many of the bored girls and disinterested parents in the audience would endorse it . personally , i think that family films should be enjoyable for everyone in the family , not just a select sex/age group . unfortunately , their number is dwindling as they are replaced with dim-witted , poorly-conceived dross like this picture . as the title suggests , rookie of the year aspires to be a baseball movie . in this , it fails in almost every respect . fans of the game will be horrified by the lack of attention paid to the nuances and subtleties of baseball , while those who don't like "" america's pastime "" will probably find this film uninspiring , unimaginative , and uninteresting ( all of which it certainly is ) . a gargantuan misstep is that rookie of the year tries a few stabs at drama while its outrageous setup allows only for the most absurd of comedies . maybe the monty python troupe could have done something with the premise , but it's way beyond daniel stern's meager abilities . as an actor , stern has a flair for comedy ( as showcased in home alone and city slickers ) , but as a director ( at least from the evidence we're given here ) , he is inept . unfortunately , as far as this movie is concerned , daniel the actor doesn't do much better than daniel the director . his character , that of a wacky pitching coached who got beaned once too often , is easily the most potentially-amusing member of the cubs , but stern tries too hard for laughs and ends up getting little more than grimaces . this movie is bad even as a fantasy for cubs lovers and mets haters . there's not enough substance here to give meaning to the "" big game "" between the two clubs . added to that , the mets are portrayed as such a ridiculously over-the-top gang of thugs and losers that it's impossible to hate them . besides , given the team's current woeful brand of real baseball , setting this team up as the heavy is a huge mistake . rookie of the year presents a perfect opportunity for a line of cameos by current and ex-major league players . personally , i can't stand the man , but in a film so indulgent of wrigley field fantasies , the omission of carry is profoundly felt . instead , all we get is an embarrassingly silly john candy doing his best harry imitation--and a pale one it is , at that . this is a genuinely insulting movie . it takes every formula and cliche and binds them together into a package that doesn't work . things might have been better if the director and screenwriter had shown a hint of aptitude , but nothing like that is forthcoming . most baseball films , even the best of them , are formula-driven . robert redford hitting a home run in the bottom of the ninth is pure fantasy , not to mention absolutely predictable , but it's still a great movie moment . rookie of the year lacks this kind of style , and its comedy is so daft that it can't compete with the likes of major league ( which was , at best , a mediocre film ) . of course , the characters are stock , and the actors aren't able to do anything with them . thomas ian nicholas , in the title role , manages to make his character as annoying and unpleasant as possible . i'm sure i'm not the only one who wished someone would plunk that kid when he was dancing off first base and making fun of the dodgers' pitcher . he puts an effort into bringing to the surface several facets of what is essentially a two-dimensional character , but there's not much that busey can do to save chet steadman . however , a purpose served by the presence of busey is to give a yardstick by which the lackluster performances of the rest of the cast can be measured . if you're a ten-year-old boy who wants to vicariously live out the fantasy of playing for a big-league ball club , this might be a movie worth seeing , but for anyone else , it represents a blunder as big as a hanging curve ball . in baseball , you get three strikes and you're out , but in the making of rookie of the year , daniel stern has gotten far more than that . nearly the only good thing about this film is that i saw it in an air-conditioned theater on a day when the thermometer had nudged above the 100 degree mark . nevertheless , half-way through the movie , the heat outside was starting to look good .

"what would it be like if celebrated playwright and screenwriter david mamet collaborated with franz kafka ? while we'll never know for sure , the spanish prisoner gives a good indication . this film , the fifth to be authored and directed by mamet ( whose recent script contributions include the edge and wag the dog ) , is both a sendup of the hitchcock-type thriller and a legitimate entry into the genre . it's mamet's most convoluted plot since house of games , but , while the overall structure and style are of noir twistiness , the underlying message is something almost any viewer can relate to : how corporate greed destroys trust and corrupts honest men . mamet's script supplies us with a seemingly-endless series of twists and turns , only a fraction of which are predictable . at times , the audience is a step ahead of the screenplay , but , most of the time , we're playing catch-up . although there are plenty of holes that mamet has no interest is sewing up ( trying to solve every riddle in the spanish prisoner is an exercise in futility ) , this is a smart film that develops a central character we can sympathize with ? a modern version of josef k . from kafka's the trial . the plot is delightfully preposterous , but holds together a lot better than the generic likes of palmetto and wild things . the difference is simple : those two films are for viewers who prefer to turn their brains off while the spanish prisoner is for anyone who likes to think and feel along with the characters . the most curious thing about the spanish prisoner is the ending ( which i will not reveal in this review ) . at first glance , it appears to be a common wrap-up that ties together several critical loose ends . there's a deus ex machina aspect to it which may indicate that mamet is toying with the audience by sending up the manner in which this kind of movie must end to satisfy an audience . but are things as straightforward as they seem ? is this , in fact , the end , or is it just the latest twist in an incredibly complex con game ? the dialogue is , of course , pure mamet . the writer/director's characteristic style infuses every exchange with its peculiar , staccato rhythm . there are those who find mamet's approach to be off-putting , but , for movie-goers who allow its strange allure to captivate them ( which usually takes a few minutes ) , it becomes apparent how crucial it is to the film's overall tone . mamet has achieved something extraordinary ? a pg rating . one of the reasons the film is so strong is that nearly every major performance is impeccable . steve martin plays jimmy dell with the right mix of charm and menace . the subtext of this film is the same as the one in many other mamet offerings ? how the current business climate rewards those who act ruthlessly and punishes those who hold to a code of ethics . with a plot that would make hitchcock proud , the spanish prisoner uses this outrageously elaborate , always-entertaining approach to illustrate these more serious concerns about what it takes to survive the '90s .

"such is the setting for beaumarchais : the scoundrel about the controversial playwright , spy and playboy pierre-augustin caron de beaumarchais . the movie beaumarchais : the scoundrel takes a light-hearted approach to its subject , resulting in an inviting motion picture . one of france's most expensive productions ever , the movie was a huge hit when it opened there last year . the secret of the film's success , other than the lavishness of sylvie de segonzac's costumes , has to be the performance by fabrice luchini as beaumarchais . with his glistening eyes and his infectious smile , he mesmerizes the camera and the audience . his wry little lips seem always to hint at some unspoken deviousness he is planning . with luchini's charisma , it is hard to root for anyone other than him . although he does not have half of the good looks of his assistant gudin , played by manuel blanc , he dazzles the women and the viewers with his grace and style . michael epp's warm and intimate cinematography provides a nice accompaniment to jean-marc kerdelhue's lush but realistic looking sets . jean-claude petit's music , especially the hauntingly lovely flute solos , make for an enchanting time at the movies . director jean-claude brisville , who wrote the script along with edouard molinaro , fleshed out a play by sacha guitry which , according to the press notes , was just a series of historic vignettes . the disorganization of the play still comes through at some points in the movie , but the actors smooth it over with their good-hearted style . one episode has beaumarchais working with a renegade spy who may or may not be a man . all of this may sound like a dull historical drama , but it is anything but . the story plays more like theater of the absurd than a movie based on historical facts . still , with his beguiling smile , one can never quite be sure if you should trust him . the movie , on the other hand , can be trusted to deliver a high old time . it is in french with english subtitles . the film is not rated but would be an r for some nudity and sex , and should be fine for most teenagers .

"a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent , but one with no edge to it . it turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich ? s and stock characters of this genre . though it's a well-written and well-acted fluff piece , it still does not have too much to say that is surprising . it's made for the gentle art-house set , those who don't want something too disturbing to think about . the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff , and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie . the film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium , and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax . the only thing that couldn't be sold , is this stiff story and tired plot line . the mystery to me , is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy . it ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one , as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper .

"love comes in many forms--platonic , romantic , and sexual--and this is the issue at the heart of carrington , a cinematic biography of artist dora carrington and her near-lover , writer lytton strachey . screenwriter christopher hampton ( total eclipse ) makes a successful directorial debut with this picture , an artistic and emotional examination of the seventeen year liaison between dora ( emma thompson ) and strachey ( jonathan pryce ) . the movie is historically accurate , but its focus is less on the events of the time than on the relationship between the principals . carrington is a special love story that challenges the intellect with as much vigor as it touches the heart . strachey would go on to write several unique biographies , using a style characterized by "" a brevity which excludes everything that is redundant and nothing that is significant . "" the film is beautifully photographed , with each scene carefully composed . the stunning sequence is made all the more impressive by the slow , deliberate manner in which it was filmed . thompson , as always , is a joy to behold . here , with a buster brown haircut , the actress gives a carefully restrained , subtly nuanced performance that can stand toe-to-toe with her oscar-winning turn in howards end . the versatile jonathan pryce , better known to american audiences for his infiniti tv spots than for film roles like brazil , is every bit thompson's equal . it's a rare pleasure to watch two top-notch equals play off one another . there is tangible chemistry between them , although not of the conventional sort . unlike thompson's most recent merchant-ivory entry , the remains of the day , carrington's tone is not one of restraint . strachey and dora don't have sex , but their love is definitely neither unrequited nor unacknowledged . this is a passionate , although never gratuitous , motion picture , with a clear view of how it wants to portray its characters and their complex relationship . the result is a memorable portrait of two of history's most unique lovers .

"the film should be like a meditation , as the introspective primo wants to get it out of his system what it meant to be a jewish prisoner and how it was unbearable to come out of that camp and think that you could still be human . turturro plays the tragic role with an understandable quietude ( his voice barely rises above a whisper ) and with an emotional understatement , conveying a deep sadness in his gestures and deep reflections , showing how difficult it is for him to see the light of day again without feeling atrophied and lost . he is the reason for any success the film has . unfortunately , the rest of the film , as worthy an effort as it is , about a subject matter that merits to be told again and again , as its holocaust tale can't be told enough to the world for its message to sink in and should be told in a multitude of ways ; nevertheless , as compelling as the film was at times , it also shot itself in the foot by trying to tell a conventional story while the more powerful and personal tale of primo levi was somewhat sacrificed by these very typical hollywood episodic scenes of how the other characters reacted to their liberation and with rosi's added attempt to attain some comic relief from these diverse characters being poorly accomplished . the meditations of primo levi and soberness of the story were the thing to shoot for here , and all one has to do is read primo's book and see how much more gripping those images were there when read than the screen images that tended to be tedious and somewhat diverting after awhile .

"it's understandable if you think you've seen this story before , because , if you're any kind of regular movie-goer , you undoubtedly have . perhaps one reason why this is such a popular premise is that it's such a frequent real-life occurrence . and , as long as there's something new or interesting in the experience , it's hard to argue with exploring these themes . sweet nothing doesn't boast an outstanding script or innovative direction , but it has a pair of exceptionally strong performances , and that's enough to earn it a recommendation . the storyline and directorial style are both relatively straightforward -- there are none of the flourishes associated with trainspotting . sweet nothing doesn't break any new ground , but , like all well-made , drug- related films , it does cause us to consider the incredible power and reach of any controlled substance . many "" drug movies "" are so dark and cynical that it's difficult , if not impossible , to care about the main characters . not so here . even the possibility of addiction doesn't worry angel -- he falls into the common trap of believing that he can stop just as easily as he started . imperioli makes us see angel as a good man with a tragic flaw , and , up to the very end , we're in sympathy with him . oscar-winner mira sorvino , who made this movie before mighty aphrodite , plays monika with the same earnestness and vulnerability that she displayed in whit stillman's barcelona . sweet nothing isn't going to score any points with the drug using community , even though it's more of a character study than a "" message "" movie . there's certainly no preaching , although the scenes of angel scheming , dealing , and stealing to get money for his next hit don't paint an appealing picture . ultimately , sweet nothing is simply the latest movie to explore the pervasive and destructive impact of drug use and drug-related crime on american society .

"screenplay : rich wilkes . director : michael lehmann . director michael lehmann's 1989 debut has become a cult classic , an acidic satire of contemporary teen culture with a surreal edge , perhaps most famous for launching winona ryder and christian slater on the road to stardom . only a loopy performance by adam sandler and a slightly more energetic final twenty minutes save it from complete disaster . in its appealing trailers , airheads looked like it was going to be a smart comedy about stupid people . consider yourself warned : this is another case where every funny line is in the trailer . the main problem with airheads turns out to be that it's a stupid comedy about people who aren't stupid enough . adam sandler is perfect ; his thick-as-a-brick reading of pip is far and away the best thing about airheads , good for some genuinely inspired comedy . fraser , however , is playing a basically average guy , and buscemi comes off as flat-out intellectual . airheads had the potential for a lot of laughs coming from the reaction of reasonably normal hostages and police to impossibly stupid band members . unfortunately , some of the hostages and most of the police officers are more idiotic than the lone rangers . the result is a bunch of jokes based on lame confrontations between the band members and a militant black d . j . , mckean's fatuous corporate type and each other , consisting almost entirely of third-grade insults focusing on bodily functions and sexual preference . the characters in airheads simply never interact in a way that's remotely interesting or funny . while the character-based comedy fails , airheads might have had a chance if it had actually been about something , if it had had a point of view or and attitude about * anything * . it's not a parody of corporate music , or corporate radio , or heavy metal youth culture , or even other hostage-based movies like dog day afternoon . there are a few clever moments near the end which take shots at the cult of personality surrounding crimes-in-progress ( all too familiar in the wake of the roadside cheering section in the o . j . simpson chase ) , but they come so late that they seem almost incidental . actually , airheads might be viewed cynically as about one very specific thing : selling a tie-in soundtrack album . in a crowd scene near the film's conclusion , there is a glimpse of the michael lehmann of heathers . it's the kind of whacked-out moment that made heathers unique , and there are a couple more like it that briefly give airheads a bit of juice . sadly , they are stretched out over a 90 minute movie .

"before i start lambasting this motion picture , let me recap my feelings about the french film upon which jungle 2 jungle is based . little indian , big city ( a . k . a . , un indien dans la ville ) was easily one of 1996's worst films -- a dull , lifeless attempt to cull laughs from dumb characters doing stupid things in contrived situations . not for one moment was it cute , funny , or likable . the predictable result is a bad movie -- the kind of pointless tripe that the mouse company continues to foist upon us in the name of "" family entertainment . "" when i first heard that allen was going to star in the little indian reworking , my reaction was that it couldn't possibly be worse than the original . ultimately , i was right , although just barely . jungle 2 jungle ( what a stupid title -- why use "" 2 "" instead of "" to "" ? ? ) is pretty close to unwatchable , and it's certainly neither entertaining nor enjoyable . it is slightly more energetic than little indian , and that's the only reason why i have given it a marginally better rating . crocodile dundee this ain't . everything in jungle 2 jungle is hackneyed . there's never a whiff of innovation or a hint that the film makers might be interested in trying something different . and , like all "" good "" family films these days , there are several obligatory flatulence jokes . neither of these aspects work . there's nothing emotionally solid or satisfying about the father/son relationship , and the duo's attempts at comedy seem more desperate than funny . the most amusing moment in jungle 2 jungle is entirely unintentional . during a scene when an incredibly fake spider is scurrying around the floor of michael's boss' office , you can see the strings being used to manipulate it . i for one am sick and tired of the unappealingly unoriginal fare that disney releases on a constant basis . it's getting to the point where a visit to the dentist sounds like a reasonable alternative to sitting through another plot-by-numbers family film from the studio of plastic characters and happy endings . at least this time they've managed to do something of dubious note : turn one of 1996's worst motion pictures into one of 1997's . congratulations , disney . i hope walt is turning in his grave .

"the nightmarish scenes seem surpassed by cinematography techniques , allowing the story to move into the realm of make believe hollywood hokum rather than relying on the viewer's imagination to do the job . the irish-born director , jordan , whose accomplishments include a few first-class films among some disappointments , only proves here , that the horror thriller , perhaps , is not what he is best suited for . his heavy-handed direction , helped only in spoiling a fine cast from doing what it is capable of . jordan's idea of a horror thriller , seems to be in letting the heroine to act in a shrill voice , rather than letting the heroine's nightmare and mental breakdown come down as something internally real . if jordan went down the poetic trail instead of opting for this gobbledy-gook he comes up with , then we might have had a solid film to comment on . it was the only scene in the movie that was able to convey how believable her panic attacks really are . i think he's delusional if he thinks he got a real part in this film . his role is so insignificant , even more so than aidan quinn's , as to make stephen rea , seem less like a star than one of the film's extras . here , he is playing the role of vivian thompson , by making his villain role as campy as he could , managing to give the impression that he is a totally evil pervert , possibly even gay . downey jr . basically brought a sense of the ridiculous to this role , allowing the film to sink lower than than the ordinary hollywood horror film usually does . the film's intellectual theme , if i can loosely use the word intellectual , is a reversal of "" snow white "" , as this time the story is not narrated from the child's point of view , but from the mother's . an adult freudian tale , i suppose . the film just becomes a mess and the acting is constantly shrill . it is a film that can't be saved by good looking photography , or diffuse symbolism , or even by great special effects , but must be viewed wallowing in its own unpleasant reservoir of putrid storytelling .

"having an extremely famous and revered subject who is willing to grant you extensive interviews can sometimes be a mixed blessing for filmmakers . first-time feature length documentarians angus gibson and jo menell received such an opportunity to speak with nelson mandela . the resulting film , mandela , is all too reverential and slow paced . the heart of the film is a long interview with mandela . a talking head can become monotonous , so editor andy keir cuts to some old film footage to illustrate some of the points mandela makes . these clips are almost all teasers . the success of good documentarians is based mainly on the probing nature of their ( usually offscreen and unheard ) questions and on how resourceful they are in gathering exciting archival materials . gibson and menell do not seem particularly adept at either . there are few opposing points of view in the picture , and the questions are all softballs for mandela . the film makes his life seem too easy and preordained . the film's approach glosses over troubles with the result that mandela's rise to power appears all too simple . dewald aukema and peter tischhauser's cinematography of rich golds and browns illustrate the beauty of the land of which mandela is so justifiably proud . in a slow show with little contrast or tension , there is a brief excerpt of a speech by then south african president p . w . botha . "" don't push us too far ! don't push us too far !

"starring : anthony hopkins , emma thompson , james fox , christopher reeve director : james ivory producers : mike nichols , john calley , and ismail merchant screenplay : ruth prawer jhabvala based on the novel by kazuo ishiguro music : richard robbins released by columbia pictures the cream always rises to the top , and such is the indisputable case with anthony hopkins' deeply moving portrayal of the stilted butler of darlington hall in the newest offering from merchant ivory . reuniting howards end co-stars hopkins and emma thompson , this offering is at once both better and not as impressive as last year's best picture contender . few will deny , however , that this is a movie well worth a trip to a theater . the warning is prophetic , but its consequences are not explored as fully as they might have been . nevertheless , we care far more about the interaction between miss kenton and mr . stevens than we do lord darlington's attempts to curtail war . we follow these two across more than twenty years , always hoping that something will crack stevens' perfect veneer of emotional dearth . in the end , it is movie's unwillingness to provide some sort of resolution that keeps the emotional power marginally below than that of a film like the age of innocence . tragedy without catharsis can be a bitter pill for any movie-goer to swallow . the method of storytelling is also somewhat suspect . while this movie is too good for us to complain about being cheated , it's hard not to acknowledge a sense of incompleteness . having viewed this interpretation , it is unthinkable that anyone could have replaced him . this monumental acting job--surely one of the best of the year , if not the best--is all the more impressive because of the lack of external emotional range in the butler . mr . hopkins is forced to employ a great deal of subtlety to bring out the turmoil beneath the surface . revel in the presentation of stevens , and the complexity of his personality . it's a rare film that successfully creates a character this compelling , fascinating , and real . despite being such a cold fish , the butler captures our sympathies and holds them , and we find ourselves desperately wishing for the impossible . tears will doubtless be shed by some members of the audience , and this film is far more deserving of them than any of numerous manipulative melodramas . genuine emotional impact--that's the key to the success of the remains of the day . emma thompson does her usual good job with her part , but the role of ms . kenton lacks the substance of her character in howards end ( and even much ado about nothing , if you're looking for a comparison from this year ) . that's not to say that ms . thompson has been saddled with a featherweight ; nothing could be further from the truth . but this is stevens' story , and ultimately sally kenton enjoys no more than a supporting role . most disappointing of all the characters is that of james fox's darlington . we're constantly told how "" good "" and "" noble "" darlington is , but rarely shown more than glimpses of the inner man . it is , for example , more difficult to understand stevens' unquestioning devotion to his employer . no one would confuse congressman lewis with a real character , but it doesn't seem that james ivory was interested in presenting more than a stereotype . lewis is involved for two reasons , and once both aims are accomplished , there's no real reason for him to be in the story at all . he serves his purpose , and that's good enough . the symbolism is the last scene is best described as cryptic . while almost any interpretation could be considered valid , the overall impression is that the final moments of the remains of the day are largely superfluous . lest the tone of portions of this review seem too negative , let me reiterate that this is an engaging and powerful motion picture , every bit the rival of howards end , and perhaps in many ways more emotionally wrenching ( this film is probably better paced , as well ) . merchant ivory with flaws is superior to near-perfection from most other producer/director teams , and the remains of the day is certainly among the better productions of the year . tragic love stories often hit home with the hardest impact , and few are better-crafted and more intelligently presented than that of mr . stevens and miss kenton .

"the relentless preachiness engaged in by red corner is the sort of approach that makes fire-and-brimstone sermons seem subtle . if this was the film's only weakness , it might be forgivable , but director jon avnet's latest effort is an all-around stinker . pull almost any word out of a negative pool of adjectives and you'll have an accurate description of red corner : dumb , boring , painful , laughable , idiotic , moronic , inane , bad , etc . occasional scenes are almost salvaged by the effective performance of little-known actress bai ling , but , ultimately , her solid portrayal of a chinese defense attorney gets lost amidst so much tripe . red corner is easily one of the year's worst big-budget motion pictures . american movie-goers suckered into seeing red corner should be equally outraged . gere's lackluster performance is one of the reasons why the film is close to unwatchable . he vacillates between scenery-chewing and wooden displays that would make steven seagal proud , and his delivery of robert king and ron koslow's ripe dialogue is often so overwrought that it's impossible to stifle a snicker . truthfully , the chinese have little to worry about -- no one could possibly take this film seriously . in the past , with movies like fried green tomatoes , director jon avnet has successfully navigated the tricky line between drama and manipulation . here , he fails utterly . there isn't a dramatic moment in red corner that rings true -- not moore's sad family history , his "" courageous "" moral stance in defense of yuelin , nor the predictably over-the-top climactic court sequences . for good measure , there's also one of the silliest foot chases in recent memory , with a handcuffed moore leaping from rooftop to rooftop while half the beijing police force inexplicably fails to catch up to him . the heroes in red corner are few and far between . from time-to-time , red corner falls into the "" so bad it's enjoyable "" category , but the movie is much too long to be more than fitfully engaging for connoisseurs of awful films . those hoping for an intelligent expose of the chinese legal system will likewise be disappointed -- the movie's political agenda is obvious , but not effectively presented . maybe somewhere , buried deep under layers of dross , there's the kernel of an interesting story in red corner . but what reaches the screen is so irredeemable that it deserves to be consigned to the darkest , most obscure shelves of the local video store .

"holy smoke is a beautiful film to watch -- from the feverish credit sequence -- of the film's title written in smoky letters , to kate winslet's psychodelic-like india sojourn , and then onto her trying experiences in the naturally scenic australian outback . the film has perfectly framed scenes and magnificent visuals , and a divertingly amusing storyline to tune into , even if it gives into its own silly side and becomes after a fast start mostly a wonderfully entertaining film touching on many societal nerve points but going nowhere but back into its own cynical view of life , resorting to a politically safe response to all its pin pricks about mind control . though , in all honesty , it should be commended for taking chances and telling its guru story in this refreshingly different style . how perceptive of a film it is , is questionable , as it is provocatively stimulated by overwrought acting and filled with the aussie taste for slapdash comedy and vulgar dialogue . there is too much of a loss of subject context to do any serious intellectual damage about any of the themes it broaches . but it does , on the serious side of its agenda , at least , raise some valid points about mind control and how men treat women . it is scripted by the campion sisters ( jane & anna ) and directed by jane , with a very noticeable woman's touch and a ribald sense of lustiness . at the gathering , there is a gaudily resplendent array of yellow and pink colors to dazzle the senses , seeming more like a light show for a jefferson airplane concert at the fillmore west than a religious ceremony . but mom has trouble adjusting to india : its crowds , lack of modern toilets , and its strange culture . all of their warmth and smiles for her seem disingenuous , especially when compared to the guru's . he also goes heavy on the mouth spray , making sure he is sweet-smelling at all times . the two go off to the outback as p . j . puts into motion his 3-day step program , and the breakdown in the film's sensibility becomes astronomical at this point , making me wonder what the campion sisters were thinking . the film loses its sense of credibility and becomes a battle of the sexes , with the inevitable male-female struggle taking precedence over the heavy-handed religious aspects first introduced into the story . in reality , praying does not guarantee that one's prays will be answered . so , in short , he's not for her , and no matter what he does won't work , which kills the romance part to this screwball comedy . what does this all mean , not too much , except its fun to see keitel get his stereotypical male psyche bruised and ham it up as kate turns the tables on him . but , ah ! those breasts of kate are really something to behold . . . but it is her personality that is the star of the film . she was the only one in the film who wasn't a shallow caricature , and her performance was daring , even smashing , taking this zany script and making the most of it , getting out of it certainly more than it deserved . which means the film actually worked in some skewed sense , as it dove into the question of mind control and the human condition and gave no answers , except the strong suggestion that having compassion for another person is what has to emerge from a person's heart before they can be expected to be free from their karma . and , in a muddled way , this film lets the audience be the observer and lets it come to its own conclusions , which is why i imagine this film will get a mixed-bag of reviews-- ranging from those who can't stand it , to those who rave about it . there were so many wasted moments that blunted this beautifully shot film , that shot itself unecessarily in the foot , even though it did manage to escape from being a dud by its freaky humor and its nonstop assault on the senses of propriety , making this a madcap comedy instead of anything else . it also badly underutilized the talented pam grier , giving her such a miniscule and predictable part , that she had no chance to do her thing . but what it had going for it , is a sense of freedom , an eye for beauty , and kate's undaunting performance , which makes it something to put in your pipe and smoke . if only it wasn't so ridiculous , it could have been a much more salient film , even if it were to lose a few laughs along the way .

"in quite a contrast , the construction of this movie is symptomatic of much of the current degradation of our society . in the remake , producers brian grazer and russell simmon manage to transform a simple kids' comedy into the filthiest kids' movie i can ever remember seeing . certainly the show does have many funny parts , and eddie murphy does demonstrates tremendous acting bandwidth , nevertheless , as a picture marketed to youngsters and where the audience is filled with kids under ten , this film exemplifies all that is wrong in hollywood today . don't misread me . i am a libertarian when it comes to films . if produces want movies overflowing with bad language , that is a judgment call they get to make . however , in shows where the trailers make it look like good humored fun for kids , where the original movie was silly and innocent , where you know that a large portion of the audience will be kids under 10 and where the rating is pg-13 , one should not expect a constant stream of filthy language including crude sexual jokes about mothers . a few years ago , this movie would certainly have gotten an r , which would , of course , have decreased the box office take . to me this movie speaks volumes about the state of the country . adults should have their shows , but why do we think children should be taught the b and the n words ? the movie does have some good aspects and several big laughs , although not near enough for an adult audience . the film starts off quite promisingly . the plot by writers barry blaustein , steve oedekerk , tom shadyac , and david sheffield starts off to be a comedy with some serious messages . the messages surround how hard it is to get thin and how fat people are stigmatized and humiliated by society . the first message is trivialized , and the second is contradicted . the movie turns into a diatribe against fat people regardless of the movie's tacked on and moralistic ending . in an impressive acting demonstration by murphy we have him playing all of the roles of a large family with obese members . other scenes in the movie , thank goodness , do work better . jekyll and mr . murphy , who was so touching in coming to america , does his crude nightclub routine though most of the show . that he can play seven roles is an amazing testament to his inherent talents and to some great special make-up effects by rick baker , but why couldn't the sweet murphy come out when the picture calls for it ? why ? it is an r picture , but with an mpaa rating of pg-13 . do not take kids under 13 to see the show , and i would prefer to see teenagers be mature before going . in the end he gave the film a thumbs sideways . we try to investigate pg-13 films , but were lolled by the innocent trailers and the name of the picture to think this one would be okay . i do not recommend this lame picture to any age group , and i give it * 1/2 for a few nice laughs and excellent special effects . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"think of him as the darth vader of directors , and yet , his work is frequently brilliant . his the age of innocence was my second favorite movie of 1993 . scorsese has a talent of which most directors can only dream . like the fbi warnings on the front of video tapes , let me warn all viewers who are incapable or unwilling to see movies with extremely graphic and arguably gratuitously violent scenes , you should pass on this movie . feel free to read the review of course . i will cover the gory aspects at the end when i discuss its ridiculous mere r rating . this means the audience hasn't a clue as to how true or realistic any of this is . i bought some parts , but doubted others . the degree of reality was not a big issue for me in this picture . it turns out all you had to do then to work in a casino was apply for a license , actually getting one was unnecessary . it took ten years to process the application , and so long as you change titles every few years , your application would go to the back to the bottom of the stack thus ensuring that any unsavory past and any mob connections are never discovered . i collected tons of fun trivia about how pit bosses work , how card cheating schemes are detected , etc . to further complicate this picture , we have sharon stone as ginger mckenna . actually most of the movie is told in narration that is periodically interrupted to let the whole cast get a chance to speak . in one scene the action freezes while the actor tells why he is going to chose to say what does . i found this extreme narration approach intriguing , but ultimate tiring . in fact , one of the chief problems with casino is that at about three hours long , it overstays its welcome . the best parts of the movie are the costumes by john dunn ii and rita ryack . ace wears one iridescent suit after another - orange , peach , lime green , cranberry red , salmon , chartreuse , you name it , but always with a contrasting solid colored shirt and tie . to complement this , the violent nicky sticks to dull grays and black outfits with little character . i think the costume designers are a shoe-in at award time . i believe they must have used crazy glue to attach a cigarette to ace's hand since he has one in every scene in the movie . the sets by dante ferretti are fun too - full of solid gold rather than pink flamingos as well as other tributes to the bad guys' bad taste . there is no bad acting in casino . stone plays the most complex role of her career and amazingly is pretty good at it , but i still liked her best in basic instinct . most of her movies have been terrible , but she does have talent in addition to good looks . deniro is one of the best actors alive today , but i found ace to be of his least interesting roles . i got tired of ace after a while . woods has a small but well done role as a wasted loser . pesci was a little too out of control for my taste , but it was a good piece of acting . bad guys will yank pencils out of people's hands and stab them in the throat . you have to endure seeing a man's hand being smashed with a hammer and the sounds of the bones being broken as the bloods gushes out . in the most disturbing of all of the images , men are killed with baseball bats with the sound of large bones snapping and blood flowing everywhere , and then you get to see them buried alive . you can handle that ? great , you are certified to see this film . whether you want to or not of course is another matter . i found myself watching my back in the parking lot when i left the theater ; i had lost a little trust in my fellow man . casino runs a little under three hours , but your seat will feel like it is at least five due to the plodding pace by editor thelma schoonmaker . the movie is rated r by the mpaa which is is a travesty . this movies is clearly nc-17 . i do not think is appropriate for teenagers . actually , with much tighter editing , say an hour less movie and even if they left in all of the gore , i could recommend this movie to adult audiences with strong stomachs . as released , i give it a mild thumbs down and award it * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : december 4 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"the premise for the perez family offers the potential for a fairly light , somewhat quirky romantic comedy . unfortunately , this production has difficulty converting that potential into something substantial . there are numerous difficulties that even the deft hand of director mira nair ( mississippi masala ) can't completely overcome . to her credit , she manages to milk some entertainment value out of a script that stumbles around trying to find an emotional focus . the casting choices here are extremely strange . alfred molina , an accomplished english actor , seems somewhat out-of-place as the brooding romantic lead . marisa tomei is probably the best of the bunch , but that's because everything about her character is so over the top : the sensuality , the accent , and the delivery . tomei breezes across the screen with an explosion of energy . the script could have used a little tightening . even then , there's still a protracted denouement needed to get everyone with the "" proper "" partner . along the way to this conclusion , we never develop much feeling for the characters . too often , they come across as stereotypes and caricatures rather than real people . nevertheless , there's still something fascinating about the perez family . perhaps it's the way it weaves in elements of the american/cuban culture conflict , or maybe it's the none-too-subtle jabs at the disorganized , easily-manipulated immigration process . whatever the case , this film offers some nice touches , both of the comic and dramatic variety , and when things work -- which they do sporadically -- it's usually because of these elements . if nothing else , the perez family can be described as "" colorful .

"in a time of bloated productions where special effects have become the movies' real stars , going back to a classic like director sidney lumet's 12 angry men can remind viewers what movie making is supposed to be about -- acting . the script by reginald rose is firmly rooted in the 1950s , but , like a shakespearean play , most of the lines reveal deeper meanings and hidden truths . arguably one of the best early television dramas was the original 1954 "" studio one "" version of 12 angry men . the only link between the two is reginald rose's script which was kept almost totally intact . the cast and the director changed , but the story stayed the same . and what a story . ( the showtime cable network recently remade the story , and , being smart enough to use basically the same script , managed to make an interesting film , albeit not in the same league as the original two . ) the rich drama with minimalist sets occurs almost completely within the confines of a jury room . the incredibly strong ensemble cast for the jury includes : henry fonda , lee j . cobb , ed begley , e . g . when he comes to the part about a reasonable doubt , he repeats it with such an emphasis that he seems to be suggesting that any doubt they may have in their minds about the defendant's guilt is probably not reasonable . the accused , played with big , soulful eyes by john savoca , never speaks , but his sunken , despondent demeanor says it all . if you didn't know better , you could assume they were reviewing some movie they had seen . none of them seems to be concerned in the least that the defendant's life is at stake . this voice of reason comes from a juror played by henry fonda , giving a resolute and perfect performance that should have at least gotten him an academy award nomination for best actor , but didn't . sidney lumet was nominated for best director but lost to david lean for the bridge on the river kwai . and the best picture award was lost the same way . easily the biggest shame was that reginald rose's script -- an absolute classic -- lost to the excellent but lesser one for the bridge on the river kwai . "" you can't refute facts . "" his banker's glasses , one of the film's few props , turn out to be key to the case's solution . although most jurors are known by the intensity of their convictions , robert webber plays someone who works in advertising and views serving on a jury no more seriously that he would concocting a laundry soap jingle . he will abstain from the second ballot , and if they all vote guilty , so will he . the beauty of rose's script is that we come to know each of the jurors by the end of the deliberations . most writers would gloss over some of them to concentrate on a few , but rose gives each a unique personality and background . boris kaufman's intimate , black-and-white cinematography makes each member of the audience feel like a 13th juror . and the wailing , solo flute music by kenyon hopkins provides a somber atmosphere without ever overpowering . my only complaint with lumet's direction is that the last holdout for guilty is allowed to convert all too abruptly . it is not rated but would be pg for mature themes . the show would be fine for any child old enough to be interested in such a serious story . i give the film my top recommendation and rating of * * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"pollock , about the renowned and controversial modern artist jackson pollock , is at once intriguing and insightful as well as boring and baffling . ed harris , who stars as pollock , makes his directorial debut with the film . although clearly a labor of love on harris's part , the film amply demonstrates why most actors need someone other than themselves giving them guidance . harris delivers one of his best performances , indeed , another oscar worthy one , but his director spoils what could have been a masterpiece by letting scenes drag on and on . still , for anyone interested in the creative process , the movie can be quite rewarding . it is difficult to show exactly how an artist goes from a blank canvas to a fully realized vision . pollock tries by simply letting us observe pollock at work . with the intense performance by harris as a troubled artist , the creative tension is almost palpable . acting like a manic-depressive , harris portrays pollock as a troubled soul . that he was able to create anything memorable through that alcoholic haze is quite surprising . one well-staged drinking-and-driving episode best illustrates the depth of pollock's troubles . although his work was frequently criticized as consisting of little more than random splashes , pollock defends his technique . basically a one-man show , it does have many other characters in complementary roles . towards the end of the picture , jennifer connelly , who was so spectacular recently in requiem for a dream , plays another of her more typical throwaway roles as the beautiful but vapid ruth klingman , the last of pollock's mistresses . is pollock a beautiful failure or a flawed success ? like his paintings , it is in the eye of the beholder . for me , it was better than a documentary on the history channel and well worth seeing . in an unsympathetic and enigmatic performance , harris creates a fascinating , flawed man of flesh and blood , who throws temper tantrums like a toddler one minute and acts like a recluse the next . if you can stay awake through the long dull periods , you will learn a lot and get to witness one of the best performances of the year in the process . it is rated r for language and brief sexuality and would be acceptable for teenagers .

"japanese auteur , beat takeshi kitano ( sonatine/hana-bi ) , one of the more provocative living directors , continues to make unusual films that are difficult to categorize . this one veers away from his usual violent ones and is a more conventional bittersweet road comedy film , but it is also a very strange film , with many odd slapstick touches to it and many experimental shots of weird images and uncalled for dream sequences . he plays the lead character kikujiro , a seedy , low-level ex-yakuza who is gruff , sentimental , bumbling , and profane . the movie seems to be about outsiders confronting the middle-class . it divides its sections like a child's photo album , as each episode is about how he spent his summer . it has titles like : "" the octopus man . "" there's also no more school activities like soccer practice . there is a madcap comedy scene of mister not knowing how to swim and nearly drowning . the film feels very sentimental , but scenes change moods with the drop of hat and it's not that easy to predict what comes next even though it looks in many ways like one of those familiar road pics about a mismatched innocent kid and an adult who's rough on the exterior but really cares inside . in the end i don't know exactly what this deliberately paced film , which seems too long at two hours , is trying to say or what it accomplishes ( which is not a negative comment , but rather reflects that the director succeeded in making his own kind of film ) . the only thing that made sense to me in a positive way , was that they were both outsiders and the filmmaker is saying it will be tough for someone to make it in japanese society unless they are disciplined and pursue from an early age what they want . the kid at this early age will have to reconcile that granny will raise him , and that her advice is to study hard in school never sounded more conventional but nevertheless seemed to be sound advice . what the kid learned from mister , is that there's a wrong way and right way to do things . the kid had one of those unforgettable summer vacations that put a little fun into his sad life . i wasn't won over by this film , it doesn't seem like the type of film kitano should be making , but it has a strange quality about it that somehow appeals to me because there's an edginess to it around its carefully manicured sentimentality . it also seemed to have its heart in the right place , as kitano has said his own father was an inspiration for the way he played the title character . there was a grimness to this film that its physical humor couldn't hide .

"screenplay : rafael yglesias and ariel dorfman . director : roman polanski . one of 1994's most unintentionally hilarious films was the adaptation of isabel allende's the house of the spirits , a bloated epic in which jeremy irons , meryl streep , glenn close and winona ryder were supposed to be playing latin americans . it baffled me that such casting could take place in an age where an anglo playing any other race would incite riots , and the casting of spirits was ultimately much of its undoing . roman polanski has made the same choice with death and the maiden , and again it was a very bad one . while as a concept death and the maiden is strong and intriguing enough to maintain interest , it is sabotaged by actors who often appear not to have the faintest idea what to do with the material . the psychological underpinnings of death and the maiden are a complex set of relationships and interactions which make for an extremely promising story . at its heart is paulina's conviction in miranda's guilt , a conviction which we should always doubt because of her paranoia and unreliability . unfortunately , as it plays out , the performances and direction make our choice far too easy for us . sigourney weaver is part of the problem , playing paulina not just over the top ( which is probably where the role should be ) but so far over the top that she falls off the top . weaver as a personality simply seems too strong to be so close to complete breakdown , so she makes up for it by contorting her face and snarling . he plays miranda as such a little weasel that if he's not guilty of this particular crime , we figure he must be guilty of _something_ . the part requires more ambiguity , and the very talented kingsley just doesn't deliver in this case . perhaps even more disappointing is the relationship between paulina and gerardo , which is remarkably intricate . all this is in the text , but somehow director roman polanski doesn't let it out . paulina never seems to love gerardo , while gerardo is mostly befuddled . the moments when they do reveal themselves , all in very stagy speeches , ring hollow because the same truths should have been evident in the performances . one scene shows what might have been , late in the film when kingsley makes a confession . polanski holds a very long take on kingsley , refusing to cut to weaver's reaction , and at that moment you genuinely wonder whether this is a guilty man spilling his guts or an innocent man giving the performance of a lifetime to save his skin . but moments later , polanski cops out with a too-obvious resolution . the performances in death and the maiden should have created a mystery . instead , the mystery is why they couldn't make the material work .

"david lynch's lost highway , his first feature film after five years , is a surreal thriller with a puzzling plot , that asks a lot from the viewer , as far as accepting this far-fetched tale on face value . it's meant to be a non-conventional film , a shocker , an attempt at post-modern noir , an avant-garde sci-fi ghost story that is stylish and engrossing , but what it mostly is , is a confusing film that tries to be weirder than his eraserhead and blue velvet films , but is too outlandish to be compared with those superior features . it also smacks of being pretentious , of putting down the characters in nonhuman terms , as if they are so unimportant that they can easily be reincarnated to appear as someone else , without any explanation being given . it was a cold story , seemingly with psychological undertones about multiple-personality disorders that stretches logic to the breaking point . but it held my attention throughout and concludes with a roller-coast ride down a dark , desolate highway , with an ending that does little to give meaning to the puzzle . but it does complete its narrative by tieing up the loose ends of what the characters were plotting and it keeps intact its pessimistic mood . it sounded like this is something that could have been said in an adult version of an 'amos and andy' sketch . lynch then goes into exploiting his usual themes of violence , gore and dubious sexual situations and we also get to see arquette stroll around in her underwear , when she's not completely nude . she was the least interesting of all the characters , partly because of her insipid performance and partly because the two characters she played were not particularly interesting . i'm not exactly clear what it means , but a lot of things in this film serve as doubles , including the couple's house which is a double for the lost highway hotel , where some heavy-duty action takes place in the film's concluding moments . both bill pullman and balthazar getty are effective in their roles , as they both seem to be acting in a low-key mode . while the loggia role was too predictably gangsterish and seen too often in recent films to bring much to the table here ( it was second-rate in maniacal comic-viciousness compared to hopper's same type of role in blue velvet ) . the movie was somewhat effective not because of the actors or the story , but because it was elusive , atmospheric , unpredictable , different in form , and gracefully ethereal . it was a film that took chances , resulting in an uneven work , but in its dark moments was able to shine as a haunting film . if one wishes to make sense of this film , it would have to be done on a metaphorical level , and it would take dismissing logic and loving a film that relishes in its darkness and obscurity .

"until we rented it over the holidays , i had not seen it in its entirety in a couple of decades . this part of the movie has a capraesque quality . too often child actors are no more than cute , sometimes painfully so . all three of these kids give skillful performances of real depth . it seems boo is the local bogeyman , or so all the kids believe . boo lives in a house that reminds you of the house in psycho . even if it does not look at all similar , it feels much the same . only brave kids , like tomboy scout , dare get near the porch , much less on it . do you remember who plays boo ? it is robert duvall in his first movie part . he does not speak a word and is not even seen until the end , but his role in the film is crucial . elmer bernstein's music for the film remind us of the magic and the simplicity of that time . the crickets outside will almost lull you to sleep , but knowing that danger or tragedy is just around the corner , you dare not blink an eye . there were tire swings in the front yard , and front porches with rocking chairs or swings were de rigueur . the kids in this picture have more in common with those of tom sawyer's era than today's . in a film bursting at the seams with great performances , brock peters's small role is acted with brilliance . the acting by paxton and anderson is chillingly effective as well . their performances are strong and believable without the natural tendency to overact their parts as villains . it is done with devastating force , but without the theatrics we have become to associate with trials . the secondary event happens near the end , but i can not describe it without giving it away so i will say no more . second only to the quality of the acting is the precise and lucid direction by robert mulligan and the literate and academy award winning script by horton foote , based on the book by harper lee . the entire show is a masterpiece crafted with loving care . a show that must be seen . and seen again . it is not rated , but would probably be pg-13 . there is no sex , nudity , or profanity . there are mature themes and some frightening scenes of people being chased and grabbed . the movie would probably be appropriate for kids nine or ten and up . i know it would have frightened the daylights out of my seven and a half year old had we let him watch it . i recommend the movie to you in the strongest possible terms , and i award the film a full * * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"inertia . the dictionary defines it as "" a property of matter by which it remains at rest or in uniform motion , "" and this is an apt descriptor for paul thomas anderson's debut feature , hard eight . during the first half , virtually nothing happens -- the characters are stuck in a stasis from which escape seems impossible . then , during the second half , momentum carries the story to its inescapable conclusion . the dualistic nature of hard eight makes it a difficult picture to size up . at times , it's engrossing , but , on other occasions , it's a lesson in frustration . hard eight opens with a fascinating , twenty-minute prologue . sydney's scam is deceptively simple and undeniably effective , and anderson presents it with flair and an undercurrent of wry humor . hard eight borrows its share of conventions from noir thrillers , but this is more of a character drama than anything else . i said earlier that portions of hard eight are frustrating . indeed , some scenes are almost painful to watch because of everyone's inability to act decisively . people talk and talk and talk , but the words don't mean anything , and nothing gets resolved . characters frequently speak in an elliptical manner , taking forever to get to the point . it's the inertia thing . there's a palpable reluctance to change to status quo . anyone expecting the high-octane , pop-saturated drive of pulp fiction will be disappointed . hard eight is a different sort of movie altogether . in fact , it owes more to films like the music of chance than to tarantino's effort . the dialogue is rich but never glib , and the characters , all pictures of loneliness in one way or another , are carefully drawn and developed . in fact , about the only elements pulp fiction and hard eight have in common are stylistic similarities grounded in the noir tradition and effective performances by the always- solid samuel l . jackson . jackson is great , as is gwyneth paltrow , but those two only have supporting roles . the core of hard eight , and the reason to see it , is the dynamic between philip baker hall's sydney and john c . reilly's john . though sydney exudes a confident , assured manner , it doesn't take long for us to recognize the desperation and loneliness eating away at him from within . hall brings this out subtlety , through a carefully- modulated performance that will linger in the mind long after the details of hard eight's minimalist plot have faded . hard eight perhaps teases us with more than it delivers . the casino scenes have a sense of energy and verisimilitude that isn't always present when the action switches to swank hotel room and sleazy dives . yet there's something almost hypnotic about the way hard eight develops -- even in its slowest , most tedious moments , it keeps our attention . and , at a time when independent films are relying ever more on comfortable formulas , that's something of an accomplishment .

"every movie has its own "" making of "" story , but , no matter how fascinating the account , it's unusual for the unexpurgated truth to emerge into the public realm . 1995's twelve monkeys is a rare exception . perhaps the first question that leaps to mind is : why call it the hamster factor ? the story goes something like this : there's a scene in twelve monkeys where a naked bruce willis is required to draw a sample of his own blood . the take went as expected , except the hamster didn't do anything . so there was a re-shoot , and the same thing happened . gilliam continued to re-film this sequence until the rodent did what it was supposed to . in the director's own words , however , this is "" a bit of detail that probably doesn't mean anything to anyone but myself .

"with a legion of titles like pet sematary , firewalker , sleepwalkers , maximum overdrive , and children of the corn , it's reasonable not to expect much from stephen king-inspired motion pictures . adaptations of the prolific author's work typically vary from mildly entertaining to virtually unwatchable . there are a few notable exceptions , however ; two of which ( stand by me , misery ) were crafted by widely-respected director rob reiner . while the shawshank redemption is not a reiner movie per se , it is a production of castle rock pictures ( reiner's film company ) , and ranks among the best filmed versions of any king stories to date . as one of the characters puts it : "" these [prison] walls are funny . what little color there is , is drab and lifeless ( lots of grays and muted greens and blues ) , and there are times when the film is a shade away from black-and-white ( give credit to cinematographer roger deakins , a longtime cohen brothers collaborator ) . it's ironic , therefore , that the central messages are of hope , redemption , and salvation . first time feature director frank darabont helms a fleet of impressive performances . his unwillingness to surrender hope wins him the admiration of some and the contempt of others , and allows the audience to identify with him that much more strongly . his is the narrative voice and , for once , the disembodied words aid , rather than intrude upon , the story . whitmore's brooks is a brilliantly-realized character , and the scenes with him attempting to cope with life outside of shawshank represents one of the film's most moving--and effective--sequences . unfortunately , following a solid two hours of thought-provoking drama , the movie deflates like a punctured balloon during its overlong denouement . the too-predictable final twenty minutes move a little slowly , and writer/director darabont exposes a distressing need to wrap up everything into a tidy little package . it is the presentation of this theme that makes the shawshank redemption unique . while this film includes those elements , it makes them peripheral . the shawshank redemption is all about hope and , because of that , watching it is both uplifting and cathartic .

"tales from the crypt presents bordello of blood it's curious how one of the most inventive made-for-cable tv series ( hbo's tales from the crypt ) could turn into one of the most toothless movie series to haunt multiplexes . bordello of blood is the second tales from the crypt feature , following in the dismal wake left by 1995's demon knight , one of that year's worst pictures . at least this followup keeps to the basic sprit of the program that spawned it . bordello of blood is a macabre , jokey affair that could give buffy the vampire slayer a run for its money as the silliest undead story of the decade . comic dennis miller is on hand as rafe guttman , the hero of the piece . miller , who got bumped off early in the net , stays around much longer here , which is fortunate , since his wisecracking is bordello of blood's most obvious asset . miller makes this movie ; without him , i would be fishing for nice things to say . several of his one-liners are legitimately funny , and the offhand manner in which he confronts the vampires is worth at least a smile . chris sarandon plays a rather dull televangelist . the film makes a lot of jokes at the expense of the religious right , but , considering that it's such an easy target , the humor seems recycled . frankly , there isn't much of a plot . the exposition exists for three purposes : to gather a lot of half-naked women together , to display as much gore as can be crammed into ninety minutes ( actually , from dusk till dawn's total probably tops bordello of blood's ) , and to give miller an arena for his verbal ripostes . the whole thing works in a campy sort of way , but this movie definitely should not be confused with "" good "" cinema . just because it's bad , though , doesn't mean that it can't have a certain entertainment value . presumably , that's exactly what the film makers intended . men go in , but they don't come out -- at least not in one piece . they are , i presume , too worked up by lilith's unique method of french kissing . it's a heartfelt sort of activity . i'm almost embarrassed to admit that i liked parts of bordello of blood -- it is , after all , a pretty sick motion picture . alas , the sense of bloody good fun gets stretched too thin . there's not enough material here to sustain the running length , and the film goes through dead patches ( most of which occur when miller isn't on screen ) . all of the stuff with chris sarandon is a waste of time that should have been relegated to the cutting room floor -- except that would have trimmed bordello of blood to an unacceptably short sixty minutes or so . so , although this movie is an improvement over the dreadful demon knight ( then again , almost anything would be ) , it still hasn't convinced me that tales of the crypt belongs on the big screen . as for the film's commercial potential , i'm afraid it hasn't got much . at best , much like buffy , it will attain cult status . such is , after all , the deserved fate of movies like this .

"the budgets of the two movies , much like their intentions , couldn't be more different . the 1994 action blockbuster was a major hollywood undertaking , with significant studio backing . black women were divided in opinion about the march -- some thought it was a great idea , others found it to be a "" sexist , exclusionary "" activity . get on the bus doesn't attempt to tell the story of the million man march -- that would be a monumental , epic undertaking . lee's primary objective is to reflect back and offer a uniquely personal perspective of that single day last october . this viewpoint , which ultimately transcends the movie's flaws , is one of the aspects that makes for a worthwhile two hours . unfortunately , many of the bus riders are just variations of stock characters . neither lee nor screenwriter reggie rock bythewood crafts more than one or two well-realized personalities . while it's true that many of get on the bus's men are sympathetic , that's more a function of good acting than of the uneven script . needless to say , there isn't enough screen time to develop these stories more than fitfully . some get better exposure than others -- most notably those of gary , the light-skinned cop ; jeremiah , the quiet man with a poignant past ; and the handcuffed father-and-son tandem . conversely , the struggle of the homosexuals to attain acceptance is handled in a superficial manner . the melodramatic ending , which includes a sermon on unity , is excessively manipulative . artificial plot devices don't divert our attention from the strong , heartfelt performances . what is occasionally distracting , however , is elliot davis' camerawork , which includes frequent changes in film stock and lighting levels . apparently , lee thinks this is artistic , but it's also intrusive . this kind of film making technique is fine for experimental and art features , but , for a drama , its pulls the viewer away from the characters , momentarily creating an unwanted awareness of the process that's telling the story . scenes like these , ripe with genuine emotion , are the most compelling reason to take this trip with director spike lee and his talented cast . -- ingmar bergman ",2,6.16119705809e-36,0.420060843306,0.579939156694
"like a marathon runner , joel schumacher's 8mm dazzles its spectators with its intense dedication and integrity as it stays focused on its goal of creating a taut suspense thriller . then , as it rounds the bend for the last third of the race , it breaks its stride and strolls over for a snack of the cinematic equivalent of junk food , the unnecessary gore of an old slasher flick . after that , it never regains its momentum . worst of all , the viewers may begin to boo their own hero as the film loses all credibility through ridiculous and cliched scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor . when the movie crosses the finish line , what are we to think of it ? do we remember its flawless execution in the majority of the movie ? or do we forever hold the pathetic final 45 minutes against it ? has the exhilaration of the intelligent suspense of the first part been negated by the schlock of the ending ? there is a scene in which the lead does something so unbelievable that the audience begins to cry out in ridicule . if you were to leave about 5 minutes before that , you would likely be extremely disappointed that you missed seeing the ending of such a breathtakingly marvelous thriller . on the other hand , if you came in late and missed the first two thirds , you would likely think you found a candidate for your worst of the year list . 8mm opens to sinister gray skies and heavy , foreboding music . in a highly nuanced performance , cage illustrates the grime and drudgery of detective work . he does his best to make the believable and the unbelievable equally credible , no small feat in the laughable last act . in contrast , the normally reliable catherine keener , from your friends and neighbors , is given a cliched role as his steadfast wife , which she manages to make even worse than it's written . the unanswered questions are almost endless . who commissioned the film and why ? what role , if any , did the rich woman's husband play ? why choose tom rather than someone else ? the beauty of the first two thirds of the movie is that these and many other questions are resolved slowly and carefully . too many movies rush the investigation phase so they can cut to the action . moreover , the movie is tamer than you might expect during this part , showing the horror of the 8mm tape mainly through the shock in tom's eyes . not too long after this the movie loses all credibility . the early tension in the audience , which is palpable , turns to derision . many of the particularly ridiculous and offensive scenes could easily have been deleted without harm to the consistency of the storyline . surely the test screening audiences must have hated them , so why are they still there ? as the ending credits roll , your reaction is likely to be , "" why did they mess up such a promising movie ?

"rather , it is a sort of pakistani version of the commitments , with the focus of the band being country/western music rather than r&b . wild west is a culture clash movie with a twist . this time , it's not pakistanis trying to fit in with whites , but pakistanis trying to be accepted as country/western musicians . the film has the good sense to approach this issue--not to mention several others--with a fair dose of humor , so while the point is made , it's accomplished without a sermon . this is a lighthearted romp , not a lugubrious piece of moralizing . director david attwood has managed to infuse his entire film with energy and zest--not only the characters , but the story itself . if the pacing is occasionally erratic , it's because attwood rarely slows down , and when he does ( usually for a moment of straight drama--such as the scenes where zaf's mother talks to him about going to pakistan ) , the audience feels the lull . occasionally , the film is a little too obvious . attwood creates a number of intentional stereotypes , but these don't always work . the "" typical american "" record producers are an example . as sendups , this pair is a little too annoying ( although the biting satire surrounding them fits wild west's mood perfectly ) . wild west never attains the flair of the commitments . in the first place , the music isn't as good or as all-pervasive . additionally , attwood's film is never that concerned about burrowing under the characters' skins . wild west isn't shallow , but it glosses over numerous issues to preserve the light tone . this could have easily become a dark , brooding motion picture . all the performers are likeable . naveen andrews shows good range as zaf , and seems perfectly at home in a cowboy hat and jacket . ameet chana , who plays the honky tonk cowboys' manager , gives an occasionally-hilarious over-the-top performance , seizing on every americanism and cliche he can find . wild west works because of its reckless spirit . the message about people's intolerance of diversity comes across all the more clearly because it isn't shrouded in long speeches and mournful testimonials . david attwood has chosen his medium well for wild west to become something with a little more substance than a typical farce .

"taking a look at the above rating , you might be tempted to make a comment along the lines of , "" oh well , i guess the second beethoven isn't as good as the first . "" while that might seem a logical assumption ( given that a 3 . 9 isn't the kind of number on expects from a rousing success ) , it ignores one basic fact : i hated beethoven . i didn't just dislike the film , i loathed it--so much , in fact that it managed to make by bottom 10 of 1992 list . having made my feelings on the original perfectly clear , it's time to examine this worthy dog ( sorry , couldn't resist ) of a sequel . it is better than its predecessor , and demonstrably so . before i "" count the ways , "" however , here are a few words about the storyline . surprisingly , the bulk of this movie is not about how the dogs tear up the house . instead , the film is content to focus upon the rather insipid lives of the three newton children . now it's time to compare the sequel to the original , and understand why i didn't leave the theater shaking my head in disgust . to start with , beethoven's second made me laugh four or five times more than the first movie ( when i didn't chuckle once ) . some of the jokes are rather cruel ( along the lines of what happened to the crooks in home alone ) , but they're still amusing . an unintentional moment of mirth comes from seeing debi mazar's too-obvious stunt double take a fall for her . second , charles grodin and bonnie hunt have settled into roles that they seemed terribly embarrassed to be playing in beethoven . last time around , the dog may have outacted them , but they get their revenge this time , when they manage to give better performances than no fewer than six canines . third , there aren't nearly as many truly embarrassing moments featuring the newton kids . in fact , nicholle tom ( who plays ryce newton ) has a few scenes where she does something very much like acting . fourth , the story , as outlined above , isn't nearly as painful as its predecessor . granted , this one is dumb , but it doesn't reach the horribly inept levels to which beethoven sank . this is a case of general stupidity not quite being as pervasive . the audience at which beethoven is aimed is pretty much the same as for the original . children younger than ten years of age will enjoy themselves immensely , and adults who aren't much more discriminating than their offspring will also have a good time . however , those who expect legitimate entertainment are in for an unfortunate surprise--not that anyone should go into beethoven's second without a fair idea of what they're going to get . the basic premise is hardly a secret . on a more serious note , there is one area in which this film makes an unforgivable blunder . it attempts , in a rather offhand way , to address the issue of teen date rape ( no actual rape occurs , but it's clear where things are headed ) . this is turned into a big joke as beethoven literally brings down the house , but the introduction and handling of this serious societal problem is worse than a miscalculation--it's irresponsible and insensitive . if a movie intends to involve date rape , it should deal with the problem , not treat it like a passing and inconsequential incident . beethoven's second is one of those movies that doesn't require a review for the reader to determine whether or not he or she will be entertained . if you like charles grodin , bonnie hunt , saint bernards , and/or the first beethoven , you'll find something to enjoy about this movie , despite its numerous obvious faults . otherwise , don't bother . unless you have kids , that is . then you may not have a choice .

"i have come up with a definition -- admittedly arbitrary -- for "" tv-movie "" as it tends to be used in a derogatory fashion . melodrama certainly plays a part in that definition , but it is more symptom than disease . the real problem with tv-movies is that they tend to be about issues , not about people . melodrama results from a story about a situation ; drama results from a story about people responding to a situation . hollow reed has been garnering some comparisons to tv-movies which are only half fair . the story concerns that tv-movie standby the custody battle , with a few provocative twists . hollow reed really covers two issues , then : domestic violence , and attitudes about homosexuality both institutional and personal . on the first front , cries of "" tv-movie "" amount to utter nonsense . director angela pope has crafted a splendid domestic drama which includes many wrenching scenes of people coping with personal turmoil . sam bould's performance as oliver is the centerpiece of that story , a quiet and reflective piece of work which allows the audience to feel his fear , confusion and isolation . as long as hollow reed is focused on the dynamics of hannah , frank and oliver , it is truly exceptional . there is , however , another issue with which to grapple , and the grappling is frequently clumsy . martin donovan , the laconic protagonist of hal hartley's trust , simple men and flirt , here plays another laconic protagonist . in hartley's films , donovan's mannered delivery works with the surreal situations ; in hollow reed , donovan is like a mugging victim who mutters "" stop , thief .

"but it's not the first . the arrival , with a significantly lower budget than fox's july 3 release , has that distinction , and , while this particular film doesn't boast any radical or surprising ideas , it combines numerous familiar plot elements into a suspenseful , entertaining whole . best of all , perhaps , is the realization that some thought went into writer/director david twohy's script . this is not a dumb movie ; in fact , with its heavy reliance upon real science , it's startlingly credible . when aliens can disguise themselves as humans , as in the arrival , we're never sure who's a friend and who's a foe , and the best science fiction/horror films of this ilk continuously keep us guessing . conspiracy lovers will have fun sorting through the layers of cover-up and treachery here . the premise is rather simple . a colonizing force has arrived here incognito with the goal of readying this world for inhabitation . that process involves accelerating the greenhouse effect -- intentionally polluting the atmosphere so that the global temperature rises , causing the polar ice caps melt . but zane isn't the only one observing strange goings-on . the arrival is low key , which is refreshing at this time of year , and it's as much horror as pure science fiction . this is the kind of movie that a director like john carpenter might have made during his late-70s/early-80s heyday . it's creepy and atmospheric , and , after a rather protracted opening forty minutes , well-paced . spectacled and bearded , charlie sheen is surprisingly effective as the paranoid protagonist . he's more of an everyday sort of guy than a superhero , and , as a result , is easy to identify with . everyone else in the cast is basically a supporting player , including ron silver as an oily ceti executive , so the responsibility for the movie lies fully on sheen's shoulders , and he carries the burden admirably . x files fans will discover a lot worth appreciating about the arrival , which shares certain core similarities with the tv show . this film , however , takes things much further . believability is a tremendous asset in a picture like this . david twohy should be commended . in a summer when tornadoes , impossible missions , and flying dragons are grabbing the headlines and the big money , his smaller effort has shown more creativity than any of those blockbusters .

"" director clint eastwood chooses an ideal , languid pace for midnight which turns it into the perfect southern story : in no particular hurry to get anywhere , yet still intriguing in its richness of detail . in berendt's novel , that fragmented approach turns the city of savannah itself into the story's principal character . the williams trial functions primarily as a lightning rod for the attitudes and perceptions of the city's inhabitants , in whom eccentricity is ultimately a matter of degree . there are , however , some vacuums hollywood abhors , and midnight in the garden of good and evil tries to fill two of them with some pretty ineffective stuff . hancock works wonders with the novel's decade-long time frame , condensing events with impressive economy . he also strains to shove the story's square pegs into the gaping round hole of studio picture paradigms . hancock and eastwood may very well have made the best adaptation of midnight possible within a studio system . the acting is first-rate from top to bottom ( including a sly and charismatic debut by the lady chablis as him/herself ) , eastwood's technical team delivers typical excellence , and many of the book's best situations are re-created with sharp humor . there's just something vaguely unsatisfying about midnight , and not just in comparison to its source material . this story cries out for a less conventional treatment , though it's still fairly unconventional by most standards . the makers of midnight had their heart in the right place , but the result teases with the promise of an off-beat exploration it delivers only sporadically . perhaps the answer to that screenwriting assignment is even trickier than the question . you don't . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"screenplay : tom jankewicz and d . v . devincentis & steve pink and john cusack . producers : susan arnold , donna arkoff roth and roger birnbaum . director : george armitage . grosse pointe blank has been bumped from hollywood pictures' release schedule a couple of times , but for once it appears that the delays had nothing to do with production over-runs or shabby quality . my guess is that the marketing people just kept asking for more time to figure out how in the world to sell this thing . when john cusack is your biggest star , the director's previous film ( miami blues ) was seen by next to no one seven years ago and the tone defies even its cute high-concept premise , you'd probably be stumped too . and no matter how they try to sell grosse pointe blank , they won't do it justice . grosse pointe blank is wildly unpredictable , wonderfully detailed and unapologetically intelligent , a comedy which takes the time to do the little things right and gets big laughs in the process . cusack plays martin blank , a killer-for-hire facing an existential crisis . john cusack is one of four credited writers for a script which boasts one of the characteristics of the best screen comedies : every minor character is a fully-realized comic creation . the exchanges between these characters are sharp and clever , rich with sometimes overlapping dialogue which actually requires the audience to pay attention . the punch lines never come quite when or how you expect them , taking deadly satirical aim at targets like organized labor , suburbia , assassin etiquette and that strange american ritual called the high school reunion . at the relatively calm center of this colorful comic hurricane is john cusack , who adds grosse pointe blank to an impressive resume of smart projects like say anything , the grifters , and bullets over broadway . his self-deprecating wit and baby-faced , sad-eyed attractiveness make him an instantly sympathetic screen presence , and cusack has to fight against his persona a bit to give martin the killer instinct he requires . the script gradually reveals bits of martin's history which explain how he became who he is , without sacrificing the comedy for an unnecessarily serious character study . it's a deft piece of acting by cusack , who has an easy chemistry with minnie driver ( in perhaps the least well-developed role ) which convincingly evokes a sense of history and familiarity . as absurd as the situations get in grosse pointe blank , the film never becomes a farce because cusack plays martin's quest for enlightenment as honest and honorable . . . even if he has to stab someone in the throat with a ball point pen along the way . oh , yes . . . grosse pointe blank could catch you off guard if you are unfamiliar with the aforementioned miami blues , director george armitage's under-appreciated 1990 thriller which wasn't timid about mixing comedy , quirky characters and occasionally graphic violence . grosse point blank is a much better , much funnier film , but it does include moments of violence which are sometimes jarring in an otherwise playful film ; martin is a killer , and we see him at work as well as at play . hollywood pictures isn't doing much to warn the squeamish about those elements , preferring instead to emphasize the comedy and a gen-x-nostalgic soundtrack heavy on 1980s punk and new wave tunes by the jam , the clash and others . a bit deceptive , perhaps , but for once i'm willing to forgive the marketing folks their trespasses if they get people into theaters to see grosse pointe blank . something this disarmingly unique needs all the creative salesmanship it can get .

"or it's a huge , sick joke at the audience's expense . or maybe it's both . you can't really put any motivation past lars von trier , a director whose fondness for rendering his own name in block letters four times larger than the film's title belies a certain streak of ego . this is a man who decided to write the rules for a new aesthetic of minimalist cinema with his dogme '95 manifesto , then proceeded to break all those rules by making a live-action musical . it has become clear that you can predict virtually nothing about the way von trier will try to make a movie , except that it will inspire extreme emotions . you may want to gasp , or cry , or smack him silly for dragging you along on his exercises in self-indulgence . only musicals can temporarily distract selma from her mission -- watching one in a movie theater , performing in one in a local theatrical production , or imagining that the world around her is turning into one when life gets particularly grim . the grimness of selma's life is rendered in von trier's favored washed-out morph of film and digital video -- big risk #1 -- but it's a tactical blunder for this particular script . dancer in the dark is fashioned as a melodrama , with developments that pit our morally pure heroine against dastardly forces . on glossy celluloid , such an old-fashioned narrative approach might have worked . the hand-held , documentary-style of dancer in the dark , however , demands a level of depth in the characters' motivations and relationships that isn't always there . that's time that could have been much better spent on the underdeveloped relationship between selma and gene , which should be central to the film . it would have been possible to turn selma's conflicted motivations into a compelling plot point . instead , it's still often dizzying , chilling and more engrossing than virtually any other film this year . big risk #2 was the casting of bjork as selma , and it's hard to do justice to how extraordinary her performance is . while her less-than-authentic czech accent occasionally distracts , she hits every emotional note with such resonance that it's painful to watch her . and as painful as it is to watch , it's equally impossible not to watch when big risk #3 -- the musical production numbers -- kicks in . they're rendered as brightly-colored interpretations of selma's interior life , inspired by the natural rhythms of a train's wheels , machinery and a record's run-out groove . undoubtedly some viewers will find it impossible to get past the contrivance , or past bjork's distinctive yodeling vocals . others will be transfixed by the image of a killer fantasizing the forgiveness of the victim , or the most abruptly concluded musical number in film history . many critics have already noted that dancer in the dark bears more than a passing resemblance to von trier's 1996 film breaking the waves in its focus on the trials of a beatific female martyr . indeed , selma's sacrifice is not set up nearly so convincingly as that of emily watson's bess , which can only make dancer seem to suffer by comparison . that doesn't diminish what von trier is able to accomplish this time around with another spectacular performance and more giddy disregard for expectations and conventions . dancer in the dark is a deeply flawed narrative that becomes a long sit during its third act ; it's also studded with several moments of jaw-dropping brilliance . it's the work of a director who'll do anything to inspire a reaction . in a world of overly sanitized cinema , it's hard to dismiss that kind of raw nerve . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"cast : mike nichols , miranda richardson , david de keyser director : david hare producers : donna gray and david hare screenplay : wallace shawn based on his play cinematography : oliver stapleton music : richard hartley u . s . distributor : first look pictures if you were bored by my dinner with andre , the designated mourner isn't for you . if spalding gray's monologues put you to sleep , prepare to snooze through the designated mourner . and if you think twister is perfectly paced , give the designated mourner a pass . this film , a series of often-disjointed ruminations about culture and class , demands active intellectual participation , and those who prefer motion pictures to be passive events will be profoundly unappreciative of its approach . directed by david hare , written by wallace shawn , and starring mike nichols ( yes , that mike nichols ) , miranda richardson , and david de keyser , the production was a success , and the bbc agreed to provide funding for a film version . so , with the participation of all the stage principals , shawn and hare made the changes necessary to adapt the designated mourner for the screen . the result is this motion picture -- a deliberate , keen examination of thoughts and ideas that features a terrific performance from nichols . bizarre as it might sound , there is actually a similarity between the designated mourner and twister . neither has a particularly coherent narrative . however , while 1996's second-highest grossing film filled the void with special effects that brought in more than $200 million at the domestic box office , the designated mourner plugs the hole with ideas and philosophical tangents , and will be lucky to garner one percent of twister's take . describing the designated mourner's storyline is almost an exercise in futility . the film is basically a monologue delivered by mike nichols , who plays a character named jack . approximately 80% of the designated mourner is jack talking . the other 20% presents comments and short soliloquies from judy and howard , who are sitting next to jack , facing the camera . occasionally , but only rarely , there's a bit of dialogue as they argue with one another about their perspectives of an event . mostly , though , this is about jack -- his thoughts , ideals , and still-open wounds . but at what price for society at large ? at one point , jack is described as being "" lazy "" , and it's an apt term . jack pretends to read poetry , but doesn't understand it . instead of curling up with a book of poems , he'd rather lie in bed masturbating or watching television . he'd prefer to remember that there once was something called "" art "" rather than fight to keep it alive . it's easy to see the designated mourner as a cautionary tale : in a world where pop culture is becoming increasingly brain-dead , who will preserve art ? does anyone still read war and peace for personal satisfaction ? for that matter , how many children today read because they want to , not because they're told to ? europeans , who often view exported american culture as a polluting influence , may find that this film has more resonance for them than it does for u . s . audiences . one of the delights of the designated mourner is the variety of topics that jack touches on during his rambling account of his association with judy and howard . shawn's screenplay is laced with subtle humor and certain evocative phrases like "" the colors in the park were quite edible . "" from a technical perspective , nothing is done to "" open up "" the play . but the closeups permit the actors to perform with their features and eyes , which adds a dimension not readily available on stage . in a character and idea-based movie like this , cinematographer oliver stapleton's simple photographic choices seem to offer the best approach . is the designated mourner static ? indeed it is -- so much so , in fact , that there were moments when i squirmed a little . we're not used to movies like this -- no more than a handful have come out in the past few years . the designated mourner demands an ongoing effort from its audience . you get out of it what you put into it , which guarantees that its appeal will not extend beyond those who occasionally crave more than simple entertainment in their cinematic diet .

"miramax is marketing into the west as a "" family film , "" and while it's admirable to do so , i'm not sure it's the best idea . on the one hand , the deliberate pace appeared to lose the children in the audience when i saw the film . on the other , adults without children tend to stay away from "" family films , "" and that would be a shame . into the west is a charming , wise and gentle film that shows enough confidence to build slowly to a satisfying climax . i spent the first half hour or so of into the west a bit edgy and uninvolved , but it slowly began to occur to me that there might be an intentional reason . the scenes set in dublin are dark and claustrophobic , but as the action spreads into the irish countryside the film takes on a lyrical majesty . while into the west is not quite as successful overall , there is still a quiet grace to the visual narrative , thanks to cinematographer tom sigel's beautiful photography of hills and coastlines . the performances are not quite as engaging as the look of the film . gabriel byrne , as the dour and laconic papa , doesn't carry off his emotional scenes particularly well . ruaidhri conroy is sharp and good-natured as the protective older brother , if at times a bit affected . ciaran fitzgerald , however , is a scene-stealing charmer with great comic sensibility . the two are just right as brothers , and their scenes together are light and well-directed . if jim sheridan's script is a bit thin , it's because the story is secondary to the feel of the film . the villainous horse breeder and his police-officer henchman are perfunctory characters ; the story might have been done just as well without them . i also thought the portrayal of the travellers was underdeveloped , but i'll admit that's because i've studied celtic folklore and wanted to see more . still , i never really minded the lack of depth because the mystical tone seemed right on . i noted earlier that into the west was less successful as afilm for children , and that assessment comes simply from listening . if you've ever seen a movie with an audience comprised largely of children , you know that you get a minute-by-minute account of what they think about it . an older boy said simply , "" nothing's happening .

"" all-in-all , there are something like fifteen numbers , with almost every major member of the cast getting an opportunity to warble at least one line . with everyone says i love you , allen is paying homage to the way musicals used to be made , back in the era when stars who didn't have great voices were occasionally forced to sing . here , it doesn't always result in the sort of track you'll want on a cd , but it's nice to know that sung lines are not being dubbed , and allen himself doesn't suddenly sound like elton john when he breaks into song . yes , it's almost painful to endure julia roberts' single number , but it's hard not to respect her for trying , or allen for giving her the chance . the plot , which centers loosely around one sprawling , extended family , is extremely complicated , primarily because there are so many characters . for most of the film , allen makes effective use of his ensemble cast ; only near the end does the crowd of people vying for screen time turn into a detriment . that's not a surprise , however , considering that the last fifteen minutes of the movie are its weakest , in spite of a wonderful song-and-dance number featuring allen and a feather-light goldie hawn ( who can sing ) . when it comes to humor , everyone says i love you is right up there with two of allen's better , recent comic releases , manhattan murder mystery and bullets over broadway . like those films , everyone says i love you is overflowing with genuinely funny moments that span the spectrum from physical comedy to sly , sophisticated wit . allen gets in a number of terrific one-liners , none of which i'll reveal here . his comic sense extends to the musical numbers , many of which are done tongue-in-cheek . one area where everyone says i love you falls a little short is in its observations about the human condition . everyone says i love you is surprisingly shallow in that regard , going for numerous , broad generalizations rather than depth . again , perhaps this is the result of having so many stories to tell . roberts is luminous . roth is a hoot . alda and hawn make for a pleasant , albeit slightly off-kilter couple . and allen , as always , is allen . even drew barrymore , playing very much against her sex kitten type , is effective . it's difficult not to be impressed by what allen has achieved with this film : successfully reviving the musical comedy in such a thoroughly delightful fashion . the production may be uneven , but it's still wonderful to behold , even at the end , when the structure frays around the edges . of course , the real force that makes everyone says i love you work is allen himself . and , in doing so , he gives us a movie that is recognizable as both "" a woody allen film "" and something refreshingly different .

"this film will evoke memories of films such as chinatown and the bad and the beautiful , and of the starlets of that era , lana turner , veronica lake , and rita hayworth . the feel of the movie is of nostalgia for the hollywood glamorous life of that period , at least it presents what we are led to believe is glamorous , while the paparazzi click their cameras at the action and work hand-in-hand with the cops , hoping to catch a hollywood figure with narcotics , or in bed with someone who they shouldn't be with , or get the goods on some commies in hollywood . there are so many wonderful performances , that it is difficult to say which one is the best , but the russell crowe , dumb tough guy , muscle man cop , takes the cake as far as i am concerned , it gives the film the raw energy and view point it wants to get across , as he believes whole heartedly in what he is doing , as he beats confessions out of those accused of crimes and works over others to get information . and believe it or not , these are the two most virtuous ones in this flick . cromwell is deceptively engaging as the police chief , with a heavy irish accent and with the demeanor of a politically connected cop , who could look you straight in the eye and make you feel as if you were talking to someone who has the goods on you . his role in the film is crucial for our understanding of the underlying sentiment of how the l . a . police force has relished its role as savior for the citizenry , even if it has to defy what the book says is the right way to conduct a criminal investigation . the film is long , but it moves at a very brisk pace , covering a multitude of sub-plots . the most disturbing thing about the movie , might not be that disturbing if you believe that justice doesn't work , anyway , and that if the criminal element gets pounded on , then , so what , they are only criminals who would be getting away with crime completely if not for these rogue cops . maybe the filmmakers are right in their slick attitude , or maybe this film is just pure entertainment . but the film loaded the deck for any other argument , and that is what deters me from going overboard and praising this film to the heavens , even if it is an exceptionally well-made , cynically humorous , and terrifically acted picture ; but , yet , it might not be as great as it appears , since its subliminal message is that you can't change the system .

"combine the talents of director robert altman and actors kenneth branagh and robert duvall , and you have the apparent recipe for a motion picture worth waiting for . but , although the gingerbread man is a finely-tuned example of mainstream entertainment , and holds the audience's interest for most of its running length , it is a little disappointing . perhaps the problem is that the story was written by john grisham , and , as one might expect , it doesn't stray far from the standard grisham formula . or maybe it's that altman has gotten lazy recently . following the less-than-stellar ready to wear and kansas city , the gingerbread man ( a blatantly commercial effort ) isn't likely to appease those questing for the next altman masterpiece . one of altman's strengths , most evident in films like nashville and short cuts , is character development , so it's no surprise that we are introduced to a gallery of interesting individuals . altman ratchets up the tension during this section of the film , providing a few genuine edge-of-the- seat moments . it's in the final half hour that the gingerbread man starts to lose its way . the denouement and ending , while in keeping with what we expect from a grisham-penned tale , are pedestrian , offering only contrived surprises . nevertheless , in part because i had invested so much into the characters over the film's better first two-thirds , i was able to accept , if not applaud , the resolution . the plot has its share of logical flaws , but that's standard for all but the very best thrillers . the gingerbread man's undeniable primary strength is the level of acting . branagh , whose training in shakespeare gives him a tendency to overact ( see mary shelly's frankenstein if you don't believe me ) , gives a perfectly-modulated performance under altman's direction . branagh's nick is strong , decisive , and obviously human . embeth davidtz , who has essayed a number of roles since her eye-opening turn in schindler's list , does her best work here since the holocaust drama , easily surpassing her bland turn in the recent fallen . ( this may be the only time hannah's acting hasn't stuck out like a sore thumb . ) the only flat portrayal belongs to famke janssen ( as nick's ex-wife ) , but at least she's better here than she was in deep rising . at its best , the gingerbread man evokes memories of alfred hitchcock , the master of suspense who used every tool at his disposal to trick , cajole , and manipulate the audience into a state of heightened anxiety . one of the mechanisms employed here by altman is the weather - - it always seems to be raining , and the approach of the hurricane promises even more wind and water . fortunately , the storm sequences are impressively filmed and serve to enhance the atmosphere , rather than drown it ( like in hard rain ) . although the gingerbread man has its faults , there are enough fine moments and solid performances to more than balance them out . while altman aficionados may be disappointed by the conventional nature of the production , fans of writer john grisham ( who gets story , but not screenplay , credit ) will probably feel right at home . the legal thriller has become grisham's home field , and the gingerbread man , with an accomplished director at the helm , is as worthwhile as anything he has helped bring to the screen . the result is an entertaining and sporadically engrossing two hours . - ingmar bergman ",1,3.4388406074499997e-72,0.700380998747,0.299619001253
"dangerous beauty is a lavish historical melodrama that has enough suds , sex , and flashes of flesh to appeal to soap opera-lovers and enough substance to attract those of a more intellectual bent . however , while the movie does more than pay lip service to themes of female empowerment and religious intolerance , the main focus is the kind of hopeless , star-crossed romance that gave wings of the dove flight . that appellation was dropped for fear that audiences wouldn't know what it meant . however , not only is the honest courtesan a more apt title , but it's a more provocative one . the words "" dangerous beauty "" mean very little , especially in connection with this film . in fact , a name like this sounds more apropos for a soft-core exploitation flick than a sumptuous tale of late-16th century venice . the time of dangerous beauty is the era in which shakespeare lived and thrived , and the region of the world in which this story transpires was one of the bard's favorite locales . as in many of shakespeare's plays , the film makers have elected to have english-speaking actors play italian characters . what's more , there are no silly accents . and , although the dialogue sounds more contemporary than archaic , the costumes , set design , and attitudes of the characters serve as powerful reminders that this is an historical tale . marriage had nothing to do with love -- it was a contract made based exclusively on considerations of wealth and position . the actress has a wonderfully expressive face and is capable of flowing effortlessly from an almost-comic portrayal to a more serious one . one of dangerous beauty's subtle treasures is the top-notch supporting cast . the actors , like the story , are helped immeasurably by the film's look . visually , this is a gorgeous motion picture . cinematographer bojan bazelli's camera loves the streets and canals of venice , making the city as much a character as any of the people . filters only enhance the beauty . using bazelli's photography as a catalyst , herskovitz creates the perfect tone -- one that is often serious , but occasionally playful , and where serenity can be suddenly interrupted by a burst of passion . as is the case with too many melodramas designed to give the audience a triumphant rush , dangerous beauty goes over the top in its closing moments , offering speech-making and grandstanding that undercuts some of the film's drama . still , it's hard to argue that , contrived as it may be , there's something satisfying about the way things wrap up . a "" commercial "" finale isn't the worst thing that could happen in a picture like this -- it may be emotionally manipulative , but , on a certain level , it works . dangerous beauty isn't great art , but it is good entertainment . - ingmar bergman ",2,0.0,0.42691681930799996,0.573083180692
"kansas city is robert altman's disappointing followup to the equally disappointing ready to wear , which underwhelmed critics and audiences alike following its christmas 1994 release . while kansas city is a modest step forward for one of america's most-respected independent directors , it falls far short of the raw power of short cuts or the intricate , biting satire of the player . kansas city is a sadly ordinary motion picture , and , in less sure hands , it might have been something of an unfortunate mess . even with altman at the helm , however , it manages to be singularly unremarkable . this hasn't been a very good summer for "" respected "" directors . altman's kansas city comes in the wake of bernardo bertolucci's vapid stealing beauty and jim jarmusch's bizarre dead man , neither of which received more than a handful of positive reviews . taking place over a forty-eight hour period around election day , 1934 , in altman's hometown of kansas city , the movie is carefully attentive of period details . sets , costumes , and props are all evocative of the time , when kansas city was booming in the midst of the country's great depression . the jazz soundtrack sizzles , with performances by the likes of joshua redman , craig handy , cyrus chestnut , kevin mahogany , james carter , and geri allen . yet , although the movie gets the minutiae right , it stumbles over characterization and plot . like an improperly-focused photograph , the background is crisp and clear , but the foreground is muddled . here , while leigh's performance leaves a definite impression , it's also out-of-synch with everyone else's . her character , who is largely a two-dimensional caricature , never interacts effectively with anyone , least of all miranda richardson's carolyn stilton , in whose company she spends the entire movie . as usual in an altman film , this narrative element eventually dovetails with the primary one . in the past , altman has successfully used multi-story narratives with ensemble casts to great effect ( nashville , short cuts ) , but not this time around . done straight , with altman's usual flair for intricate character development , there's a lot of potential in kansas city's basic plot . inexplicably , however , altman decided to do the movie with a satirical edge . the film plays like part homage , part affectionate parody of old- time noir thrillers . the three main characters -- blondie , carolyn , and seldom -- are intentionally developed as types rather than as fully- fleshed out personalities . there are numerous occasions when altman obviously has his tongue planted in his cheek . unfortunately , that storytelling method doesn't really work in this setting . kansas city has an uneven , confused tone . there's nothing uncertain about the jazz sequences , however . altman has filmed them from a fan's perspective , and the scenes that take place in seldom's hey-hey club during an all-night cutting contest are infused with an energy that's lacking elsewhere . music aficionados , especially those who appreciate the tunes of kansas city's era , will find a great deal to appreciate about the film . others , especially those expecting something profound from an altman feature , will discover that , though kansas city has its share of arresting moments , the production as a whole is too superficial to be considered amongst the director's best work .

"director : spike lee . i see spike lee working . i have a pretty good idea what he was up to with summer of sam . it would be a tale of how paranoia can amplify the xenophobia that already exists in so many people . it would be both ambitious and intimate , both a period piece and a piece of who we still are . it would be an important film . i see spike lee working , and i saw summer of sam working . . . up to a point . for a while , the stories of lee's two main characters are promising enough that summer of sam keeps you watching . leguizamo is particularly strong in his role ( will someone _please_ put this guy's talent to good use ? ) , but both characters work in juxtaposition to the son of sam -- they're anti-social people who happen to functionally anti-socials . though the period production design comes and goes , there's still a strong sense of this particular time and place in new york . we see 1977 as a more intense period in the life of the city , when the thin connecting thread of rooting for the yankees was always ready to snap into violence . there are lots of big issues moving through summer of sam , and lee is ready to make sure we always know it . lee even opens with an extended crane shot that serves as a big flashing red light that the director wants touch of evil/boogie nights respect for his project . lee may be talented , but his pure id approach to directing leads to some baffling decisions . no decision in summer of sam is more baffling -- or more harmful to the film -- than lee's portrayal of berkowitz himself . it was a risky enough maneuver introducing berkowitz as a character at all rather than leaving him as a bogeyman haunting the periphery of the film ; it was even riskier to show him freaking out in his apartment . that scene turns a killer's demented rampage into absurdist comedy , making you wonder what the hell lee was thinking . at times it gels into a gripping film . at other times , you can see lee working . . . and you can see him working far too hard . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

""" beach red "" undoubtedly had a positive influence on two recent world war 11 films that had the same theme , terrence malick's "" the thin red line ( 98 ) "" and steven spielberg's "" saving private ryan ( 98 ) , "" only cornel wilde's film is the more powerful and impactful one , dissecting the fighting marine in one of the most alluring allegories made about the futility of war . spielberg's overall work pales in authencity besides it , even the landing on the beach scene , which wilde depicted in just as gory a way , holds its own with "" saving private ryan . "" while malick's film suffered from too many pretentious moments of philosophizing and did not have the same authentic personal touches that wilde's film had . the film will work its way through all the action scenes by highlighting four soldiers , who generally are reflective of all the marine's views . it uses the clich ? s about these men to push its story further , going past the clich ? s , to eventually show the bigger picture and ask the bigger question of why there is war . the men are heard thinking aloud , in much the same way malick used this device in his film but here it seems more natural and was done some 30 years before he did it . what also helps give this film a very real look , is that the men come across as soldiers trying to act rather than actors trying to be soldiers . this brilliant , subtle film , connects war with the everyday attitudes of mankind , as it penetrates the soul of those in combat , seemingly , better than most films of this genre . it's a film whose voiceovers of how the men think hit deeply on the emotions of its subjects , also its use of flashbacks are superbly utilized , and its brutal coverage of the war itself has the force to show what combat must have felt like . this neglected war film is as rough and tumble as any sam fuller film , as poignant a reflection of the racial divides in the military as any ww11 film made before the 1960s , and it leaves a lasting impression that is both haunting and expansive . when cornel wilde says , "" that the trouble with killing , is that after awhile we forget why we are doing it , "" we see how the film has the resourcefulness to deal with both its pacifist message and with the certain primitive rawness it portrays , that gives it that uncertain edge all influential picturesneed .

"this is a dull , unfunny film , lacking an edge to it , as if the screenwriter is past his prime and maybe should take a year off to re-gain his touch . this sitcom film is actually worst than most sitcoms seen on tv ; it should have come with canned laughter . in the theater i saw it , no one laughed ; and , watching a comedy without hearing any laughs gives me a creepy feeling . the film lacked the kind of comedy expected for a satire . even if the story never took off , i at least expected the film to have some snappy things to say about those who are part of the hollywood establishment and not to mirror it so closely with the hollywood scene that it can't even be considered a parody anymore . i thought brooks mailed this script in . it was hard to think of brooks as a victim of hollywood when he was surrounded by so much wealth and the only thing he strove for was to become even wealthier . he never asked the muse to inspire him to write a great classic , only for some "" summer script "" he can sell to the studios as a blockbuster movie . if he was trying for a parody ( which i assume he was ) , he just didn't succeed . all he succeeded in showing was that there is some bitterness in him and that he's part of the "" fat cats "" who make up the hollywood scene , too complacent to make a real satire with some bite in it . but i think the main problem with the film , besides the fact that it's a one idea film , is how that idea was weak and never developed . the brooks character never spelled out why he was so desperate in the first place and he never showed us how good a writer he was . i feel i must question the film's intent : why should i feel sorry for brooks ? where is the comedy in the film ? what is this nonsense about getting a live muse supposed to mean ? what kind of statement is he making about creativity ? should i really believe that someone would have the chutzpah to make a film about a screenwriter who lost his touch and pays for a muse so he can get that touch back and makes a film that is so flat and uninspired ? is he trying to tell me that people in hollywood will believe in anything and so should i ? and there you have the funniest line in the film and it comes right in the beginning of the film . what goes for comedy in this film , has to do with his whiny relationship to the muse . that dumbness prevails , and he comes up with a lame idea for a film in which he wants to have jim carrey star in , is supposed to be his way of saying that hollywood doesn't know what's good from what's crap , or doesn't care . this is "" i love lucy "" kind of humor . that this film is about making money being tantamount in hollywood to creativity , is a theme that has been often done and this film has not touched on any new ground with that concept . if you make a satire , it better be funny , or if it is a more serious film , it should try to have a script with some characters who are profound and perceptive . to have a satire with nothing to dig into is unfortunate , as brooks chose to go for his laughs by having his character be a whiner , grousing about the demands of his muse , the attention she gives to his wife instead of him , how steven spielberg snubbed him , and how cruel it is to be in hollywood if you are a creative person . this slight aim at comedy turns this film into a slight film . if you really had to see this film , the only reason i could think of doing so , was to see the attractive sharon stone as a muse . even though the script did not provide her with material that was funny , she did show by her facial expressions and body language that she has a penchant for comedy if given a chance . at least she was more lovable than any one else in the film was .

"screenplay : willard carrol . director : willard carrol . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 118 minutes . playing by heart inspires the question , "" how many stories do you need to tell in one film in order to cover the entire spectrum of human relationship dynamics ?

"" and that's at _least_ two too many . there's an inherent danger in films that include several intertwining stories , namely that some will be much more interesting than others , and that the interesting stories will be less effective because we keep dashing away from them . at least one of the stories is extremely effective -- anderson and stewart's tentative sparring -- thanks largely to the charismatic intelligence of the two actors . two others are consistently diverting -- jolie and phillippe , and connery and rowlands -- again thanks largely to the performers , which is a particular surprise in the former case . but with three other stories vying for time , including the utterly tedious trysts between stowe and edwards , there's never enough time for the good ones to build any momentum . carrol and usually reliable editor pietro scalia ( an oscar-winner for jfk ) chop playing by heart into bite-sized three minute chunklets , giving the film all the emotional resonance of a wittier-than-usual episode of "" the love boat . "" that wittiness is what carrol is counting on to carry us through playing by heart , a film with more than its share of effective verbal sparring and clever quips . the dialogue makes the episodes diverting a fair amount of the time ; it also disguises a script that has virtually nothing interesting or new to say about relationships . it often feels like carrol is engaged in a decade-late scramble for a "" modern "" take on love and sex -- incorporating hiv into not one but two of the storylines -- but essentially every one of the stories is about people trying to understand and be understood . it's not a particularly revelatory take on why love is complicated , which makes it even more unclear why carrol had to tell so many stories to say one thing . perhaps it's the sense that carrol is trying _so_ hard that makes playing by heart frustrating in spite of its occasional sparks of life . john barry's score drapes a curtain of strings heavily over too many scenes , vilmos zsigmond's cinematography paints an unbelievably romanticized l . a . nightscape , and the conversations sometimes turn into exchanges that in real life would end with someone getting smacked across the face . yet for all its flaws , playing by heart probably would have worked if it had given us the time to build a familiarity with only one or two couples , allowing us to understand their hopes and fears about love in more depth than a quick character capsule could provide . the moments just don't add up in this epic of the heart that proves the law of diminishing returns . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"screenplay : michael crichton , anne-marie martin . director : jan debont . the makers of big-budget summer movies and those who attend those movies appear to have come to an understanding , an understanding best exemplified by an observation i made while watching twister . several times during the film , there would come a point where it would become clear that the latest sequence showcasing industrial light & magic's computer-generated tornados was at an end ( it usually coincided with the dialogue once again becoming audible ) , at which point several members of the audience would stand up and quickly make their way towards the restroom . they were probably rather secure in the knowledge that they would not miss any crucial plot twists or juicy bits of character development during these brief expository interludes , and even if they did , they were not missing what they had come to the film to see . not a penny of the money they had plunked down would be wasted if they missed a couple of the characters engaged in conversation . it is this complicity which produces monotonous displays of technological prowess like twister , a film with a script that makes jurassic park's look positively labyrinthine by comparison . i suppose you have to give the creators of twister credit for coming up with a premise which involves people trying their damnedest to get close to tornados rather than trying their damnedest to get very far away ; it could have been even more tedious . the problem is that it doesn't take long before twister starts to look like a loop film . there are only so many ways you can film a bunch of vehicles driving through fields , over dirt roads , along highways before it becomes a chore to watch , and while director jan debont uses every swooping trick at his disposal , there is an awful lot of nothing going on during twister an awful lot of the time . there may be more driving in twister than there was in debont's debut feature speed . hunt is probably a better actor than bullock , and certainly provides the requisite cuteness factor , but bullock's heroine was able to comment on speed's improbability throughout the film with her priceless reactions . the trite love/hate relationship with which hunt is saddled is something no one could tunnel out from under , and neither she nor paxton has the big screen charisma to make the scenes without inclement weather anything but a monumental bore . every single character manages the astonishing non-euclidean feat of being less than one-dimensional , with characterization coming in such subtle forms as the fleet of identical black mini-vans used by elwes' corporate scientists ( as though you actually needed to see the three 6's behind his ear ) or the van halen tunes blasted by one of hunt's more annoyingly quirky cohorts ( philip seymour hoffman ) . films like twister are often defended with comparisons to amusement park rides -- that they make up in thrills what they lack in drama . i don't think twister even qualifies as a roller-coaster . yes , the visual effects are impressive , but it is impossible to watch them with anything but detachment , because as much as debont tries , he can't imbue a natural phenomenon with a personality ( he actually tries harder than he does with his actors ) . twister is a surprisingly gloomy and inert experience , with exactly two flashes of inspiration through its two hour running time . when they come , they only serve to remind you what the rest of the film is lacking : any sense of the fun that summer movies are supposed to provide . whatever one might think of the increasing mindlessness of effects-driven blockbusters , you'd think they could at least manage to entertain , or to give you a reason to come back when you get up to go to the restroom .

"since time immemorial -- memorial day 1996 , to be precise -- one question has plagued movie-goers the world over : what might mission : impossible have looked like if someone had shown the faintest interest in telling a coherent story ? as answer , i give you ronin , an international espionage thriller fueled by as much brain power as adrenaline . the comparison to mission : impossible is almost too easy , especially given the presence of jean reno in both casts , but it's a telling comparison nonetheless . ronin shows how much more effective a film can be when set pieces are connected by ideas . as the operation begins , alliances quickly shift with the prevailing winds , no lofty ideal more important than the exigencies of the moment . that notion both drives the film and provides its title . mission : impossible flirted with the same concept , but it was to turn characters into vengeance-driven super-villains . the characters are sketched in only the most basic terms , in keeping with their private natures , yet they are given presence by actors like deniro and reno bringing mournful weight to their performances . though few words are spoken in the script by j . d . zeik and richard weisz ( a . k . a . david mamet ) , the very lack of human interaction between the characters speaks volumes . for a fairly introspective film , ronin is also a fairly exciting one . director john frankenheimer goes to the car chase well perhaps once too often , but those he uses are tense and well-constructed . the action level is as high in ronin as it has been in any summer blockbuster of the last few years , and it's _better_ action , more white-knuckle gripping than whoop-it-up flashy . for some viewers , that may be reason enough to spend two hours at the movies , but it's all the more impressive because the action serves the story . every subsequent violent encounter raises the stakes in this chaotic world , while it's always clear that the combatants neither know nor care what they're fighting for . ronin certainly has its share of jagged edges , notably the aforementioned opening titles and a distracting romantic sub-plot between deniro and mcelhone . some may find the characters too remote and under-developed , and consequently find it difficult to invest emotionally in the story . i found the chilly isolation of the characters exactly what ineeded to become emotionally invested ; the emptiness of their lives and actions _is_ the hook . this isn't earth-shaking profundity we're talking about , merely the building blocks of effective drama -- the visceral coupled with the intellectual , actions with consequences . consequences were never really an issue in mission : impossible , which makes it that much easier to appreciate what ronin has to offer . it's no longer a james bond landscape of world domination . for once , evil in an espionage thriller isn't what people do , but why they do it . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"" the best movies aimed at younger audiences are careful in the way they handle the fears of life . some pictures cop out and lack tension or interest since they are so sanitized that nothing exciting or scary ever occurs . other put in frightening scenes , but overdo it . here the writers , judy freudberg , tony geiss , and stu krieger , have a deft touch in putting together just enough tension , but not so much that little ones , say 3 or 4 , can not handle it . i liked the way the screenwriters had the dino kids get words mixed up as human kids so often do . the drawing style is far removed from the painstaking constructed and dramatic realism of a disney animated feature . different in this case does not necessarily mean inferior , instead the land before time possesses a minimalist , but warm and natural beauty . the animators use stark colors of oranges , blues , and greens and then underdraw the images to craft a simple and almost surreal landscape . i found it lovely . perhaps my favorite part of the movie is the music . not surprisingly , it is rated g , and there is not a single bad word spoken . this film would be fine for children of any age although there is always some risk that sharptooth might scare them a little bit . i recommend this film to anyone young at heart and give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"topsy-turvy is not a bio-pic in the conventional sense of the term . it's a bio-pic in the mike leigh sense of the term , which may be redundant . however , it may not even be appropriate to call it a mike leigh film in the conventional sense of the term . one does not think of period pieces when one thinks of mike leigh , nor would one likely think of him as the ideal film-maker to look behind the scenes at the creation of gilbert & sullivan's "" the mikado . "" how would this fashioner of human drama approach the fashioning of light opera ? as it turns out , he does so with detail , detail and more detail -- occasionally to nerve-wracking excess . but the concept for "" the mikado "" is only the beginning of the arduous process of staging it . when topsy-turvy finally hits its stride , with gilbert's visit to the exposition , it's an extraordinarily entertaining piece of work . leigh dives into the pre-production process with gusto , exploring every possible element of a theater company's work . the rehearsal scene , in which gilbert attends to the details of pacing and the inconvenient absence of two actors , is hilarious even in its attention to the mundane ; a scene of gilbert using japanese women as advisors for cultural authenticity has a similarly unexpected charm . you know a film-maker is doing something write when he can wring comedy out of a wardrobe session , and drama out of whether or not a song will be cut from the production . it would be easy to embrace topsy-turvy unreservedly if leigh seemed to know what to cut from his own production . even at 160 minutes , the film never seems tedious ; it does , however , seem unnecessarily meandering . leigh also goes overboard in the inclusion of musical numbers , giving us full-scale recreations of at least a half-dozen songs from three different productions . while the inclusion of some gilbert and sullivan work would seem necessary as context , leigh takes too much liberty with the length and breadth of his musical interludes . by the end of topsy-turvy , you may feel you've sat through "" princess aida "" and "" the mikado "" in their entirety . in most films , the extra weight would probably have sunk the whole endeavor . blessedly , topsy-turvy is that rare film that gets better with every passing minute , building to that enchanting final hour of preparation for production . still more blessedly , leigh has put together another superb cast to give the scenes as much bite as possible , including leigh veterans like alison steadman ( life is sweet ) and timothy spall ( secrets & lies ) . broadbent's gilbert has a bit more to work with -- and hence the showier part -- but corduner's more amiable , artistic integrity-bound sullivan is a delight as well . leigh covers a lot of ground in topsy-turvy -- perhaps , ultimately , too much -- but he has the good sense to come back around to the good stuff . the result is a biography as singular as leigh himself : messy , insightful and , of course , very human . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"in this kidpic , which is a very safe movie to make in today's iran , as even with the intolerant dictator khomeini dead , and a more liberal regime in its place , there is still no room for anything but subtle dissension to get sneaked into the story , because of strict censorship , and the most fertile ground to do that sneaking in , is in a type of film like this one , where there is no challenge to the ongoing political system and its fundamentalist religious system , as everything is seen through the children's eyes . the only thing , is that i couldn't pick up any subtle attacks against the regime . maybe it was too subtle for me to pick up , or maybe there was no dissensions , this was just meant to be a tear jerker of a film . the story is guileless . it is about a lost pair of shoes and a shared pair of sneakers , which if it was an american film and didn't give me a chance to see a country such as iran , which i am unfamiliar with , but curious to see how it looks under this new regime , i would have been really disappointed at how weakly structured it was . but because it is iran and i am aware how difficult it is to make a film under censorship there , i am more tolerant of its flaws than i ordinarily would be . why he doesn't tell his teacher about this problem , i don't understand , especially since his teacher seemed like a kind man , and , since this might be a problem that is not that uncommon in a school where a lot of the children are poor . but , then again , if he did that , that might have taken away the reason for making this slight film , in the first place . if this film was made in the states , its theme could be , the ny state lottery theme , "" you gotta be in it to win it .

"gillies mackinnon's handsomely shot hideous kinky contains enough lush visuals to serve as a moroccan travelogue , albeit one with a time warp . although the images are sometimes quite compelling , the threadbare story never is . billy mackinnon's thin script is based on a novel by esther freud . her life may have been exciting , but almost nothing happens in this movie . without much information , the viewers are left to piece together for themselves what the director is trying to say . this might lead us to believe that we are to feel compassion for a single parent coping with poverty , but the effects of being destitute are never made obvious . julia doesn't appear to be lacking much since her needs and desires are so modest . perhaps the movie is about the effects of bad parenting since julia does a better job of loving her children than caring for them . the characters are all written so superficially that one can never be sure what the filmmakers' intentions are . the film's title is completely misleading . there are no hideous , kinky sex scenes in the movie . a different title would have helped in marketing the film correctly , but perhaps the current one will prove more lucrative . after a reasonable amount of time has elapsed , the picture comes to a completely predictable conclusion . as we leave the theater , we remember the sights and sounds of marrakech . nothing more of the story lingers . none of the characters were interesting enough to care about when the movie was on . still , if you've been considering morocco for your next vacation , this might be just the movie for you . hideous kinky runs 1 : 38 . it is rated r for a little nudity , profanity , and sexuality and would be fine for teenagers .

"yes , it's true -- stir of echoes features a child who sees dead people . it includes in its metaphysics the notion that disgruntled spirits cause chilly temperatures in the human world . it is at least partially a tale of a wrongful death made right . depending on where you fall in the old glass half-full/half-empty argument , stir of echoes is the beneficiary of either extraordinarily good timing or extraordinarily bad timing . maybe comparisons with mega-success the sixth sense will doom it to obscurity . or maybe a spillover effect , with movie-goers still hungry for supernatural subject matter , will present it with an audience it might not otherwise have had . for my money , viewers can't go far wrong either way . if they go , they'll be moderately satisfied ; if they don't go , they won't be missing all that much . it's awfully easy to dwell on the similarities between stir of echoes and the sixth sense , weighing in simply with whether the former is better or worse than the latter . it would be easier to ignore those similarities if the whole film didn't feel overly familiar . that doesn't change the way stir of echoes is likely to be viewed today : a mish-mash of familiar elements . that's not to say that stir of echoes isn't also a reasonably effective thriller in its own conventional way . david koepp , who helmed the unsettling and little-seen trigger effect , has a knack for crafting a scene that gets under your skin without resorting to too many shock cuts . he also draws nice work from a solid cast , particularly erbe adding a few shadings to the thankless wife role . koepp's direction may get a little showy -- jittery time-lapse shots of ghosts , funky business in the "" theater "" of tom's hypnotic trance -- but it does its job manufacturing the creeps . it ain't deep , but it's scary enough . unfortunately for stir of echoes , it's less effective than it could be because koepp seems to think it _is_ deep . the subtext of joe six-pack tom seeing his new gift as a shot at finally doing something extraordinary comes and goes , and it's hard to see anything voluntary in his character arc . bacon's performance suffers from this erratic motivation -- he's reasonably convincing both in his terror and in his determination , but the two never come together . by the time koepp trots out an extended flashback of a crime in progress , his melodrama has bogged down the chills . ironically , that's yet another way stir of echoes is like the sixth sense : it's a moderately clever genre diversion that wants us to believe it's something more . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"screenplay : alan parker , oliver stone . director : alan parker . mpaa rating : pg ( adult themes , mild profanity ) running time : 135 minutes . there aren't too many directors in the last thirty years who have directed one live-action musical ; alan parker has directed two ( bugsy malone and pink floyd the wall ) , and the latter was probably the last through-sung english-language film . well , one of them fulfilled the promise , anyway . parker has made evita a compelling visual spectacle , but his leading lady doesn't provide the same vibrant quality , even though it seems she is trying desperately to do so . one of the reasons andrew lloyd webber's musicals have been so successful is that they combine the appeal of grand opera with an accessible pop sensibility , and it would seem difficult to capture that operatic feel in a film . alan parker , however , has exactly the visual style required for a production like evita . the funeral scenes which open the film have an impressive scope , captured in mournful tones by cinematographer darius khondji ( seven ) , and there is a flow between scenes which is both theatrical and cinematic . evita is a story told almost entirely through the songs , and parker doesn't add any radical new interpretations with his direction . there are a few changes to the material , notably the addition of the new webber/tim rice composition "" you must love me "" which could have been dropped into any disney animated musical and been just as suitable , but other changes are more interesting and effective . some exciting arrangements also give new kick to webber's tunes . "" buenos aires "" gets a swirl of percussion to match eva's drive , and "" i'd be surprisingly good for you "" has a seductive swing . certain songs do have a dated , jangly 70s guitar sound , but the characteristic infectious bombast of webber's compositions holds up surprisingly well . what works far less well is the presentation of the film's three central -- and , for all practical purposes , only -- characters . antonio banderas brings his appealing swagger to che , as well as a voice which compensates for a weak lower range with some sweet high notes . che is the voice of eva's critics , yet he isn't a complete character , and neither is juan peron . that leaves madonna to carry the dramatic weight of evita , and it is plenty clear that she is eager to prove she can handle it . madonna understands determination , and she can convey it ; charisma is another story . you can't act a magnetic personality , and madonna is left to play benevolence without the force of will which makes her uncertain motives intriguing . the irony is that , for someone who has made a career of not caring about how people perceive her , madonna seems to want too much to be liked and respected as an actress . her evita lacks mystery , making alan parker's film a sweeping piece of visual theater with a star who wants to step into the audience and thank everyone for coming .

"all the country's money was needed to rebuilt , as movies seemed a frivolous activity at the time . rossellini used poor film stock leftover from the fascists and filmed despite all the technical deficiencies he ran into , and came up with a gritty , authentic looking film for his grim story of survival and fight for freedom . this was a breakthrough film for the director , whose neorealism style , using a hollywood type of narrative and a documentary style approach to filming , caught the dire mood of the resistance movement and the ordinary people who fought the fascists . awards such as the new york film critics circle and best film in cannes in 1946 , came to this film . it awakened an international audience to the knowledge that italian cinema was well and roberto rossellini was a director to be reckoned with , along with de sica , who just filmed "" shoe shine "" in the neorealism style , also , to international acclaim . the film has an immediacy about it , but it also seemed overly melodramatic at times , relying so much on the premise , that by being as good as the germans , the italians , the slave-race , can prove that there was no need for the war since there is no such thing as a master race . that manfredi dies without talking after being tortured , makes his heroics larger than anyone else's , and proves that the italians are every bit as good as the germans . rossellini hoped to examine the italian soul and show that there were both good and bad people among them , while the german's have gone so far off the edge of sanity , that it is hard to find a good german because of their perverse beliefs . anna magnani gives the film credibility through her humanity , as her story is filled with her heartfelt yearnings . the other professional actor among all the nonprofessionals to standout , was the priest role as warmly played by aldo fabrizi , who elicited a call for sensibility and caring for people . though , the film does not seem as relevant as it was when first released and acclaimed as a masterpiece , having lost some of its purity , nevertheless , it still retains its moral high ground and its ability to show the collective will of the people , who resisted being oppressed . it is still a work of considerable merit .

"operation condor , originally released in hong kong as armor of god ii , is something of an odd choice to release , since all die hard chan fans are likely already familiar with it ( it's available on video ) . all indications are that the distributor wanted to put out a jackie chan movie this summer , and settled upon something that was cheap and readily available . as far as plot goes , this film , like many of the action superstar's efforts , is decidedly silly and disjointed , often bordering on incoherent . any chan storyline is , after all , just a flimsy excuse to permit the leading man to perform a number of amazing stunts , engage in astonishing martial arts fights , and present a series of hilarious comedy bits . all of those elements are present here , but the connecting material is exceptionally feeble , to the extent that the patches between action sequences are not just filler , but boring filler . of the four recent u . s . chan releases , operation condor is the weakest , although it still offers a certain degree of episodic entertainment value . the film , which chan co-wrote and directed , plays like a merger of an indiana jones outing and a james bond adventure , and makes far less sense than any entry into either series . operation condor is light on spectacular action sequences and heavy on fights and comedy . there are numerous hand-to-hand combat incidents , all of which are meticulously choreographed ( things still go wrong , as shown in the end-credit outtakes that are a hallmark of chan's films ) . operation condor also features a high humor quotient , with loads of quick gags and longer physical comedy setups , that is enhanced by the cheesy dubbing . from an acting standpoint , chan is the only one worth paying any attention to . as always , he's a leaping , whirling dervish of madcap energy and exuberance . his ability to make any action sequence both funny and exciting is a testament to his talent . other players in operation condor fill their roles effectively , but no one comes close to accomplishing what michelle khan did in supercop -- encroach upon chan's place in the spotlight . give or take a few minor variations , chan films are essentially the same , which is what the fans want . fortunately , chan is so enjoyable that , even though the plots and characters vary from recycled to irrelevant , mediocre films like operation condor still feature bursts of undeniable entertainment .

"" and my heart was lightened at the sights and sounds of children making beautiful music . i'll willingly make the following admission , gentle readers : i found myself getting misty-eyed during music of the heart . i follow this admission with one of a different sort , the sort that makes viewers everywhere want to throttle critics within an inch of their thumb-turning , star-distributing lives : music of the heart , moving though it may be , just isn't a particularly good film . then those nasty budget cuts begin rearing their ugly head , forcing roberta to find creative funding solutions . there's no denying the fundamental emotional appeal of a story like this one . hollywood has always loved "" inspirational teacher "" films , and there have been plenty of them : the miracle worker ; to sir , with love ; conrack ; dead poets society ; stand and deliver ; lean on me ; mr . holland's opus ; dangerous minds ; etc . in recent years they have become even more prevalent -- perhaps indicative of how much more complicated teaching has become -- as well as more rigidly formulaic . the ultimate disappointment of music of the heart has little to do with its predictability ; on the contrary , like many films of its kind it hits its emotional high notes even though you know exactly where they're going to come . no , the disappointment in music of the heart comes from a strangely fragmented narrative that never quite commits to a central story . the film occasionally explores the juxtaposition of guaspari's background and that of her students , but the intrusions of social problems in the kids' lives are lurching and token pieces of "" reality "" -- a child of separated parents here , a victim of a drive-by shooting there , an instance of domestic abuse thrown in for good measure . when the story starts winding its way into guaspari's experiment with blind dating , you have to wonder if director wes craven has any sense for its focus . there's no question it was a pivotal moment in the history of guaspari's program , nor is there any question the carnegie hall benefit concert -- featuring big name performers like isaac stern , itzhak perlman and arnold steinhardt -- makes for a rousing finish . it just doesn't feel like part of the same film . stand and deliver reached its natural conclusion with the first successful ap exam ; music of the heart tags on a 45-minute coda after guaspari's first successful concert . of course there are several touching moments in that final 45 minutes , and throughout the film . unfortunately , however , it's the ideas alone that are touching , not the way the film presents them . it's easy to be moved by the sentiments expressed in streep and estefan's introductory clip . it's harder to be moved by a story that lets the mere concept of an "" inspirational teacher "" film do all the work . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"every time i think hollywood has slipped beyond redemption , someone in the system produces a film like jerry maguire that renews my faith . apparently , creativity is not dead in the mainstream movie market -- not entirely , at least . this is the kind of movie that reminds me why i started reviewing in the first place . jerry maguire is magic on celluloid -- fresh , funny , romantic , and upbeat . you'll leave the theater with a smile on your face and perhaps a tear in your eye . here , however , the actor is playing to his strength , which lies in an arena that demands less testosterone . leave the stunts and explosions to schwarzenegger and stallone . cruise is best when he stays low key and flashes the occasional smile . and , in this picture , surrounded by a superlative supporting cast , his ability shines . jerry maguire works because we root for the title character , and it's cruise's performance that forges the link between his screen personae and the audience . the essay attacks the sports agency business , advocating a more humane approach . in an era of downsizing and force reductions , it's easy to understand what happens to jerry . it's about finding one's heart and soul in a business climate that attempts to rip both away . writer/director cameron crowe , who previously helmed say anything and singles ( in addition to scripting fast times at ridgemont high ) brings both a strong sense of verisimilitude and a lively wit to his film . even as jerry maguire reaches out to the heart , it tickles the funny bone . not only does crowe have a knack for creating multi- dimensional personalities for secondary characters with minimal screen time , but he uses traditional formulas in unique ways to serve his themes . for example , a common sports cliche is integrated into jerry maguire in such a way that it doesn't seem cheap or overdone . it's not the point of the movie ; it's just another piece in the overall puzzle . with a fine performance , he forms the glue that holds the production together . cuba gooding jr . , who was excellent years ago in his boyz 'n the hood debut , but hasn't done much since , invests rod with a remarkable level of energy and enthusiasm . and , although his favorite phrase is "" show me the money ! "" , with a standout performance , she transforms what could have been an minor role into something noteworthy . zellweger displays an appealing blend of strength and vulnerability , and her chemistry with cruise is nearly perfect . their first romantic scene is charged with a playful , but undeniable , eroticism . if there's one downside to the actress' appearance in jerry maguire , it's that she's not on screen enough . and , even if jerry isn't immediately smitten , we are . while the budding romance between jerry and dorothy is jerry maguire's most enchanting element , the remainder of the film has the necessary appeal to keep our attention when zellweger isn't around ( cruise , on the other hand , is in just about every scene ) . crowe , who doesn't have a subpar entry on his short resume , has crafted another winner here . in fact , with its attention to detail , top-notch performances , and universal themes , jerry maguire marks his most successful movie to date . for anyone who has forgotten the feelings that a wonderful movie can trigger , jerry maguire provides a welcome reminder .

"screenplay : robert rodat . producers : steven spielberg , ian bryce , mark gordon & gary levinsohn . director : steven spielberg . mpaa rating : r ( intense wartime violence and gore , profanity ) running time : 170 minutes . the first and last image in saving private ryan , a war story of shattering visceral and emotional force , is an american flag waving in the breeze . it's a bold choice , one that defines what makes this film so unique among modern war films . for over 25 years in the post-vietnam era , american war films have reminded us over and over again that war is a chaotic and futile endeavor characterized by gleeful brutality and morality of convenience . even the most well-received examples -- the deer hunter , apocalypse now , platoon , full metal jacket -- trafficked in violence and psychological devastation as though they were the only facets of the wartime experience worth exploring . the stories were less about the people in war than about war itself as an existential disease . saving private ryan may be the most mature war film ever made , because it combines the horrifying realism of contemporary war films with the sense of purpose conveyed in the patriotic adventures of the 1940s . the reluctance of miller's men to take on this mission is understandable , since it's amazing enought that any of them survived the initial assault on the beach . it's hard to begin describing the film artistry involved : that half hour is disturbing , surreal , at times darkly humorous , simultaneously too intense to watch and impossible _not_ to watch . if it had been spielberg's intent to play a game of wartime can-you-top-this with his contemporary peers -- and you never believe for a second that it was -- the contest wouldn't even be close . cinematic warfare has never been more agonizing . nor , in its way , has it ever been more human . hanks delivers his finest performance yet as miller , whose trembling hand betrays demons his men can only guess at ; barry pepper radiates steely-eyed confidence as sharpshooter pvt . the most harrowing performance , however , comes from jeremy davies as cpl . in one brilliantly acted scene , upham's psyche vanishes into the rubble . this being a tale of the "" last noble war "" in american history , it's also about heroism , though not in a conventional sense . faced with an assignment everyone considers fubar -- an acronym for the saltier version of "" fouled up beyond all recognition "" -- miller and his men are forced to make it make sense . this is the sort of heroism saving private ryan examines : not the heroism of men fighting an obviously evil enemy for an obviously just cause , but the heroism of men taking responsibility for doing their duty to the best of their ability . it becomes the ability to make meaning from the hell war always has been and always will be . steven spielberg , who set a new standard for himself with schindler's list , actually manages to raise that standard in saving private ryan , which isn't to say that it's a perfect film . john williams score may not be as intrusive as it was in amistad -- but then , how _could_ it be ? -- but it still underscores scenes best left silent , and one late scene is a bit too reminiscent of schindler's "" i could have done more "" speech . yet even in that moment spielberg drives home his unique , provocative vision . late in the film , a character tells ryan , "" earn this , "" handing him the responsibility for making his life -- and the lives of those who died for his sake -- matter . that waving flag which opens and closes saving private ryan is a challenging sort of patriotism , free from self-righteous over-simplifications like "" good war "" vs . "" bad war .

"a modern day western adapted from cormac mccarthy's national book award-winning novel of 1992 , which was accurately transferred to film by ted tally's script , as it kept the same laconic cowboy dialogue from the book intact , but was reduced considerably from the over three hour length director billy bob thornton originally shot it in , to under two hours , the length the people from miramax wanted it . it was hard to tell if the film was missing anything because of this deletion , but i did find the film to be directed with a skewed sense of rhythm . there were also too many scenes that failed to go anywhere , making the film dull at times . for a slow moving film , there was the contradiction of scenes happening too fast to be developed and fully realized . as a result , "" all the pretty horses "" failed to be engaging . if the filmmaker was aiming for an epic , he sure didn't get it in this sometimes elegaic film . what he got is something that plays more like a slick magazine photo shoot on the travails of being a cowboy , or as a touristy travelogue of what the old west was like , or as a stylish film that can't find what it wants to say and stumbles around in the grimness of a prosaic story about youthful aspirations . what it lacked was some emotional kick , as the scenes where the cowboys show off their spirited exuberance , seemed more portentous than not and just didn't jive with the unsure pace of the film . what caught my attention in a positive way was how pretty the picturesque vistas were and how the film gave off some good cowboy vibes about friendship and loyalty and had some good cowboy lingo to go along with all the pretty horses and with the hot-blooded senorita played by pen ? lope cruz . it becomes an on-the-trail film , with a love story and a revenge story filling in the life of the youthful cowboy drifters , as everything in the film gets boiled down to a simplicity that is too simple-minded to just accept without asking questions .

"" grant gives a sympathetic and convincing performance as the everyday doctor who gets sucked into the vortex of some gruesome terror and has no idea what is going . it is created in such a way that the audience is in total empathy with the lead character . i can't tell you any more of the show other than to say that every time you think you have it all figured out , you haven't . although the medical conspiracy and most of the rest of the show is made believable , there is a homeless syndicate that isn't . finally , there is an unnecessary and confusing epilogue . why it is there , i have no idea other than perhaps it is a failed attempt to address some criticisms made during the test screenings . it is rated r for violence , emergency room gore , some bad language , and brief nudity . there is no sex . teenagers will probably like the show , but it would be inappropriate for younger kids . i recommend the picture to you and give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"i think angels and insects is supposed to be a morality tale , but it is so outlandish , it is comes off more as parody . if it were not so slow and somber , one might be tempted to laugh at it . the movie's purpose is to show the strong linkage between humans and insects . in one of the more pedantic editing jobs ( belinda haas ) in recent memory , we have frequent cuts between the horrors of the insect world and that of the human . although there are several memorable insects scenes , perhaps the most dramatic is the immolation scene of the moths in the ubiquitous candles that lit the rooms of that era . a close second is a scene straight out of the birds but with moths instead of birds attaching the helpless female . as soon as the viewer realizes that the film is meant to be out of focus and that he does not need to run and complain to the manager , the film switches to a swirl of upper-class dancers in england and here the colors are rich and the picture is sharp . watch the costumes ( paul brown ) in this and every scene of the show for they are as ridiculous and pedantic as the editing . some gowns are overgrown with fruit favored by insects while others are made to look like insects , e . g . , bold and broad , yellow and black bee stripes . well it turns out that the alabaster's home is a highly dysfunctional one , and we have long since learned from the movies that almost all victorian homes were . since i am sure movies would not lie to us , it is nice to be safely ensconced in the late twentieth century . i guess the servants are not supposed to know the dark secrets of the alabaster household . the shocking ending of this movie is telegraphed about a million times , but i will not reveal it here , although the trailers for the movie do . in one of the better pieces of dialog , the husband says of the mystery , "" whom can i tell that i should not destroy in the telling . "" this is a show where i developed an admiration for all of the fine details of my watch . at the one hour point , i began to wonder what , if anything , was ever going to happen . as it turns out , in the last quarter of the film the actors and actress come alive as if they had come through a metamorphosis . why director philip haas did not breath live into the show before then astonishes me . there is a genuine , albeit mainly unrealized , potential in this picture . actually , the worst part of the movie is not the plodding direction , it is the stilted script by belinda and philip haas . most of the lines fall like stones and are laden with gibberish . a typical one forces the excellent actress kristin scott thomas to have to say verbatim , "" i wish humankind would create such altruistic virtues , but sometimes i think socialism may never be realized . "" angels and insects runs too long at 1 : 57 . it is rated r for lots of sex including certain perversions and full male and female frontal nudity , but if you are looking for an erotic show , i think you have the wrong film . i would not let teenagers see the show unless they were mature . although i am glad the characters finally came alive toward the end , i can not recommend angels and insects to anyone , and i give it a single * for a good conclusion to a poor film . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"its title , female perversions , almost guarantees that most people will write off the film as a soft porn exploitation flick . those who do see it for cheap thrills will probably be disappointed . but those viewers expecting thought provoking material , will not be . although the film opened to uniformly good reviews , first-time director susan streitfeld had difficulty obtaining financing for it . eve's bravado will likely shock many viewers . to reinforce this notion are numerous sayings written on everything from pillow embroidery to billboard signs .

"nothing is sadder than seeing a once-beloved movie series keep churning out sequels long after its time is past . three more sellers' panther movies subsequently were released ( the return of the pink panther , the pink panther strikes back , and the revenge of the pink panther ) , none as good as the first two , but all worthwhile diversions . unfortunately , sellers' death in 1980 failed to stem the tide of the films which , at that point , should have been ended . the trail of the pink panther and the curse of the pink panther were produced , neither of which was worth the price of admission . benigni , star of the farce johnny stecchino , is adept when it comes to physical humor , and his abilities are highlighted here in four or five scenes that include heavy doses of slapstick . however , while these produce some laughter , they are largely regurgitations of material from previous pink panther entries . beyond copying peter sellers' style , benigni has little to do , and less by which to distinguish himself . i guess the years have taken away his edge . once , we demanded superlative films from him ; now , we're just hoping for something somewhat entertaining . the opening titles are as uninspired as those for any of the pink panthers . although they give the big cat his first opportunity to mix with live actors , the interaction is stale and fails to stir a chuckle . it's sad , because i always considered the pink panther to be one of the funnier cartoon characters , both on his own and introducing the clouseau movies . not only is the animated panther not up to snuff , but the opening theme is sub-par as well . at least the end credits retain the original music in its full orchestral splendor . there's very little about this movie that isn't disappointing . one might make the foolish assumption that for a pink panther film to be produced out ten years after the last disastrous entry in the series , there had to be a creative reason--preferably something new and inventive . instead , however , we are lumbered with this cobbled-together effort . if there's a mercy , it's that son of the pink panther should finally put the clouseau family to rest . then again , that's what i thought about the curse of the pink panther .

"u . s . availability : wide release 6/2/95 running length : 2 : 15 mpaa classification : pg-13 ( mature themes , brief nudity ) theatrical aspect ratio : 1 . 85 : 1 cast against type , clint eastwood plays robert kincaid , the male protagonist in the motion picture adaptation of robert james waller's the bridges of madison county . kincaid is a sensitive loner , and while the actor is certainly known for his portrayal of independently-minded individuals , one would be hard pressed to describe dirty harry as a model of sensitivity . as good as eastwood is , however , it's his co-star , meryl streep , who really shines . the bridges of madison county is a beautiful film , not only in the way it was photographed , but for the manner through which the characters are revealed to us . eastwood will not be hurried , choosing a relaxed pace for the unfolding of this romance . there's a lot of dialogue -- some mundane and some touching on the quintessential aspects of the human experience . the bridges of madison county presents a richly- textured emotional tapestry . it's the kind of movie you know is going to be special before much of the running time has elapsed . in the book , francesca is not an especially strong character -- things happen around her and she's swept up in the current . richard lagravenese's screenplay rectifies this , creating a dynamic personality for streep to work with . in fact , the actress commented that she was "" blind to the book's power "" but thought the script was "" beautifully crafted . "" there aren't many intelligent motion picture romances . and , as in that film , there's a profound sense of inevitability permeating the atmosphere , a realization that this magical time must come to an end -- and soon . it's easy to believe that francesca and robert's love is deep and special , but perhaps the real test of the film's power is whether the statements , situations , and characters transcend the screen to leave a lasting impression . not many pictures are created with the necessary skill to challenge our perceptions and beliefs , but the bridges of madison county is a rare exception .

"mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , violence , brief nudity ) running time : 140 minutes . early though it may be to make such a prediction , i'm going to do so : no one will be more deserving of an adapted screenplay oscar in 1997 than brian helgeland and curtis hanson . james ellroy's 1990 novel "" l . a . confidential "" was 496 pages of sprawling , tangled plotting and a staccato prose style in which entire chapters seemed to fly by without a single verb rearing its active little head . even the author himself said he didn't always know what was going on at any given time . hanson and helgeland took that narrative and tamed it into an intricate but accessible crime drama . they remained true to both the style and gritty substance of the story while giving it the appeal of pop entertainment . which is not to say that they have created an unqualified triumph . l . a . confidential is the kind of sturdy , satisfying studio vehicle which turns up rarely enough that it's easy to mistake it for a minor masterpiece . it's well-crafted but never dazzling , consistently interesting without being engrossing . helgeland and hanson haven't exactly taken an unfilmable novel and turned it into a classic . they've taken a novel which would have been a three hour art film and made a 140-minute mainstream multiplex success . there's more than a whiff of chinatown to l . a . confidential -- it's hard not to break into a chuckle when one character appears with a jake gittes memorial nose bandage -- but the story manages to stake out its own unique territory in exposing the dark side of booming post-war los angeles . it does a particularly impressive job of hooking into the relationship between high-profile crime and the media , skewering the public's inexhaustible appetite for sordid tales about which they can feel morally superior . curtis hanson's direction manages to navigate a smart path between the glossy image of hollywood and the sleazy reality . it's a perfectly appropriate ambiguity that l . a . confidential ( photographed by the talented dante spinotti ) may be one of the best-looking films ever made about ugly doings . it's also appropriate that the characters are similarly ambiguous , complex people whose motivations are never as pure or as selfish as they appear at first glance . another of the accomplishments in this fine script is that those characters feel softer and more humanized than they do in ellroy's novel , easier to sympathize with . yet one of the problems with l . a . confidential is that while the characters are uniformly well-acted and multi-dimensional , there's not enough time to get under the skin of any one character . we find ourselves surprised by some of the decisions the characters make , but once we understand a single basic motivation for each one there's not much left to learn about them . pearce , crowe and spacey do solid work with solid characters . they're never boring , and never fascinating . hanson and helgeland still do an impressive enough job that i couldn't help wishing they had trusted their own skill with material a bit more . the plot twists of l . a . confidential may be a lot to take in , but not so much that they require the constant nudging the script and direction provide . every character is identified in bold letters ( sometimes literally ) , every significant development is accompanied by a flashback or wordy exposition to make sure we realize the significance , and whole chunks of the film are summarized at various points like chapter-ending cliff's notes . it all gives a smart film the feeling that it's not quite so smart after all , or that the audience isn't expected to be smart enough to figure it all out . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"it's always good around halloween to have one really bad horror movie to look forward to . alas , this year's lone october horror release , thinner , falls considerably short of the level of awfulness established by last year's halloween 6 . while this latest adaptation of a stephen king novel doesn't approach "" good "" film making , it's at least watchable ( if just barely ) -- a quality that no one would ascribe to the most recent chapter of the unbearably moronic michael myers saga . there are two kinds of movies based on stephen king stories -- the dramas ( stand by me , the shawshank redemption ) and the horrors ( pet sematary , the mangler ) . in general , the former are quite good while the latter are terrible . so , since thinner falls somewhere between genres , it's fitting that the film's quality is also somewhere in the middle . thinner is a rather shallow and unsatisfactory examination of some potentially-worthwhile themes and ideas . equally unfortunately , it's not at all scary .

"what have we come to as a culture that we can look with nostalgia at the events of a mere decade ago ? to most people nostalgia means events that happened several decades ago . even films about the 70s like the ice storm and boogie nights seem to be covering a time that happened too recently to parody with bad clothes and ridiculous sets . the wedding singer attempts a nostalgic look at the classic period of the mid-1980s , 1985 to be precise . although most people will have trouble remembering how 1985 was different from today , the wedding singer clears it up . in the previous decade we wore incredibly bad clothes with heavy reliance on clashing colors of lavender , pink , and lime green . our tastes in household decorations looked like an updated version of the ticky-tacky 50s . how soon we forget how awful we were . the wedding singer frustrates and delights with equal measures . one minute it is an over-the-top comedy that is gratingly bad , and the next it is a surprising sweet and touching little romance . director frank coraci exerts little control over his picture , which drifts aimlessly from bad to good and then back again . with long hair and a completely different look and approach , happy gilmore's star , adam sandler , plays robby . his uneven performance can be blamed partly on the script by tim herlihy , who also penned happy gilmore , but it is mostly sandler's own fault . the main reason , other than the energetic music , for the success of the movie is the lovely performance by the female lead , drew barrymore . julia is engaged and her romance , like robby's , is equally ill-fated . in the predictable , but none the less charming , romance developing between them , robby and julia don't realize that they are in love until almost the end . it isn't until julia practices her wedding ceremony kiss with robby -- she's not sure the degree of tongue that is appropriate in a church setting -- that they realize that they have the hots for each other . when robby isn't doing something stupid like the embarrassingly bad scene in which he ruins someone else's wedding party just because he is depressed , the chemistry between julia and robby is genuine and captivating . drew barrymore has innocence down pat . the supporting cast has lots of promise , partially realized . if -- and that's a big if -- you can ignore the stupefyingly bad comedy , you will find that the movie has a big heart underneath . rewritten this could be a wonderful movie . even as it is , it still has a lot to recommend it . it is rated pg-13 for sex-related material and language and would be fine for kids around ten and up .

"beautiful but headache inducing . kwon-taek im's chunhyang can probably best be thought of as a korean opera . featuring extensive sung narration in a type of ancient korean music called pansori , which features a male singer whose singing sounds more like screaming , the movie can be jarring to untrained ears . i haven't wished for earplugs so much since years ago when i took my young son to a live performance of the power rangers . the professor says that he didn't like pansori the first-time he heard it but that most people like it once they get used to it . that may be , but life is short , and i hope to avoid activities that assault my ears whether it be from the power rangers or pansori . to you , pansori may not be noise . it may be , well , music to your ears . the singer , accompanied only by a drum , which his voice easily drowns out , is the film's narrator , and the movie is a dramatization of his long , narrative song . the concert was four and a half hours long , but the film , thankfully , only runs two . as they cut to the concert's audience , we see living proof that many koreans are extremely moved by the music with reactions ranging from tears to dancing in the aisles . there are no surprises in the script or the acting . the same cannot be said of the production , which is sumptuous . the sets are impressive , the cinematography has a golden glow , and the costumes are intriguing . my personal favorite was the tall black hat with the wide brim that many of the men wore . mark twain once said that "" wagner's music is better than it sounds .

"date released : 6/30/93 running length : 2 : 34 rated : r ( language , mature themes , sexual situations , violence ) john grisham's novel the firm is a furious page-turner , the kind of book that you don't want to put down once you've started reading it . the characters are well-rounded and developed in such a way that the reader cares about their fates . the fascinating setup ( roughly the first 100 pages ) is perhaps the novel's greatest strength and , even though the eventual resolution lacks punch , few would deny that the firm is an entertaining read . sydney pollack's film the firm is the kind of movie that almost anyone could walk out on without feeling that they've missed much , regardless of whether they've read the book or not . very little of what made the written version so enjoyable has made it to the screen and what we're left with instead is an overly-long ( two hours and thirty-four minutes , to be exact ) , pedantic thriller that , at best , can be described as average . that's a good idea , because the film the firm doesn't come close to reaching the level of intensity achieved by the novel of the same name . comparisons are inevitable , of course , but it isn't necessary to have read the written version to be disappointed by the visual adaptation . the plot is a good place to start the discussion . this was the book's weakest element and , if anything , it's worse in the movie . while the final "" twist "" to the movie's story ( which in no way resembles what happens in the novel ) is clever , it is also difficult to accept . is it reasonable to believe everything that happens in the pivotal climactic scenes ? i doubt it . while i applaud the screenwriters for coming up with a unique way to conclude the film , their inept execution of the concept causes the ending to seem cheap and contrived . the unfortunate tone of the movie is set during the first hour . the film spends quite a bit of time using short , often-disjointed scenes in an attempt to recapture the near-perfect mood of grisham's setup . this would have worked nicely if those various snippets had successfully conveyed the allure of the firm to mitch and abby , but things rush by so quickly and everything is so out-of-sync that the result is to make the first quarter of the movie long and tedious . there are many differences between motion picture and novel . with numerous expected , mostly-minor cuts and changes , the first half of the film stays reasonably close to its written counterpart . not all of the changes are bad--some , at least in their intent , are intriguing . unfortunately , the script writers appear not to have thought things through all the way--a fault that grisham's novel is rarely guilty of . not until the last act does he give anything resembling a feeling performance , managing to effectively sabotage mitch in the process . by the time things get interesting in the firm , we don't care what happens to the protagonist , because the actor playing him has failed to capture our sympathy . jeanne tripplehorn is worse , playing abby with as much enthusiasm and energy as a zombie . even as i was apathetic towards mitch because of cruise , i began to actively dislike abby as a result of tripplehorn's unimaginative performance . consider for a moment someone of emma thompson's caliber in this part and you'll want to break into tears of frustration . fortunately for the film , the supporting cast is uniformly strong . both of these actors steal many of the scenes that they're in . as impressive as these two , if not more so , is gene hackman's avery tolar . softened in the movie from his counterpart in the book , this avery becomes the only completely real--and sympathetic--character in the film . hackman's performance is more than half the reason why . in the hands of a lesser actor , avery could have become sappy , silly , or stupid , but not in this case . by the closing scenes of the firm , he was the only one i really cared about . i dislike bashing movies simply because they differ from the books that spawned them . the mediums of entertainment are different , after all , and should be treated as such . no film can do a perfect adaptation of a novel . putting aside the issue of its source , this is not a good movie . if there's a reason to go , and i don't think there is , it's to see gene hackman's performance . unfortunately , given his amount of screen time , there's a lot of other garbage that will have to be endured along the way . in the past , i've enjoyed many of syndey pollack's projects ( out of africa and tootsie in particular ) , but this film got derailed early and even this talented director proved unable to get it back on course . i suppose it's a difficult task to try to please both admirers of the novel and the casual movie-goer who has never read it . in attempting that , pollack has made a mess of everything--plot , characterization , and pacing . fans of john grisham's novel will see the firm regardless of what reviews it gets , so to them , and to others , i offer a cautionary warning to be wary . the firm had a lot of potential but the production team found numerous ways to mess it up . this isn't an awful film , nor is it unwatchable , but i'd think twice before spending time and money in a darkened theater with telling of mitch mcdeere's struggles .

"director : alexander payne . this is how i know i'm dealing with a film of uncommon intelligence : election resists the tidy summations in which most films are all-too-eager to wrap themselves . like many recent films , it is a comedy set in a high school , but it's more than just the latest high school comedy . it deals with a student body election , but it's not really _about_ a student body election . it's a film in which characters narrate much of the story , but it doesn't use that narration in a conventional way . like director alexander payne's previous film citizen ruth -- if to a somewhat less successful degree -- election is a satirical scalpel that refuses to let you know exactly when or whom it's going to cut . it would have been easy enough for election to turn into a broad comedy about adolescent peer politics , and it _still_ would have been more insightful than most teen comedies . payne and co-writer jim taylor , working from tom perrotta's novel , have bigger targets in mind . tracy flick's campaign casts her as a political cousin of our current president , seeking election as a "" you really like me "" validation rathern than out of a desire to serve ; even her nomination speech parrots the naming-of-names , i-feel-your-pain personal touch . even the ridiculous posters , filled with little more than sloganeering , seem disturbingly similar to national election campaigning . it's savvy , cynical , and very funny . even more effective is payne's use of that old literary device the "" unreliable narrator "" as counterpoint to his direction . only paul , perhaps too dense to be duplicitous , seems pure of heart . as he did in citizen ruth , payne explores the way we convince ourselves that our motivations are pure , even when we don't really understand what our motivations are . if payne stumbles anywhere , it's in his choice to focus much of the film's second half on mcallister's domestic troubles . but election is too smart to be derailed by this problem , too clear-eyed in its study of good intentions muddled by psychological baggage . with surprising sympathy towards all his flawed characters , alexander payne creates a furiously funny film in which his surrealistic directing touches keep the audience off-guard . he understands that in a world where people can't even summarize themselves in a neat-and-tidy sentence , we can't expect to summarize the movies about them that way . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"an historical fantasy film that took eight years to make . this low-budget independent effort ( it had a whopping budget of about $20 , 000 ) , initiated from an original idea by kevin brownlow . the events are make believe ; the b/w film resembles an orwellian nightmare . this is where this fantasy film begins . it looks as if it is a semidocumentary , with scenes padded for dramatic effect and narrative . the power in the film is from the sheer force of the clash of ideas and the expressions coming forth from the nonprofessional actors . the film allows you the luxury to see things for yourself instead of being spoon-fed what to believe . the result was that seven minutes of the film were cut until recently , when brownlow regained control of the film and milestone released it for the first time in its full version . this scene of euthanasia was done in a most humane manner , by injecting them with poison , it was one of the most powerful and stunning scenes to behold . the filmmakers used mainly original rather than merely authentic costumes and props , and they refrained from using any archival footage , which would have been easy to obtain . they drew most of their sense of history from the 1940s by watching newsreels , but in the film they only used voice-overs from professionals who donated their services and used montages and close-ups to get the 1944 look they wanted . you can say whatever you want about their methods , but when you look at the results you feel the intensity and madness of the drama , it has a curious starkness about it that is very compelling . it had the mark of a true artist's stamp on it , even its amateur production values do not weigh heavily against it . even the ending of the film , as it comes to no particular conclusion , it just ends by allowing this remarkable work to be viewed for what it suggested , shows a confidence that the film accomplished what it set out to do . it certainly took the smugness out of anyone thinking that fascism couldn't surface in a country like england . it showed the final liberation by the americans , as an ironically gruesome scene , where collaborators were rounded up and executed . a call for pacifism , is the clearest message that could be heard from between the lines when all is said and done .

"date released : ( late ) summer 1994 running length : 1 : 26 rated : r ( language , mature themes , sexual situations ) as might be guessed from the title , this is not a movie that takes an optimistic view on the basic honesty of men in relationships . what might have been called "" man bashing "" had it been penned by a woman will likely be termed "" insightful "" and "" honest "" in this instance , since writer/director john gallagher is a man . of course , no matter how long she tries to ignore the truth , it's obvious that eventually something is going to happen that scott won't be able to pass off as an "" optical illusion .

"but , unlike films that live or die on the basis of unexpected plot disclosures , secrets are only important to the locusts in the way they define the characters , explain their motivations , and drive their actions . it's entirely possible to guess one ( or more ) of the truths that these men and women keep buried before those revelations are explicitly divulged , but such insight is unlikely to diminish your appreciation of this film in any significant way . in fact , it may actually enhance it . the locusts is a genuinely powerful motion picture that achieves its potency through character development rather than audience manipulation . this approach is becoming increasingly rare in dramatic motion pictures , which often try too hard to generate tears , and it speaks highly of first time feature director john patrick kelly's ability to tell a story . the locusts is also successful in the way it manages to interweave small moments of triumph with intimate tragedies . this is not by any means a "" feel good "" motion picture ( quite the opposite , in fact ) , but there are times when it touches a core of optimism . writer/director kelly has chosen a strong cast to work with . vince vaughn , who made his mark in swingers before appearing in the lost world , gives his strongest performance to date -- an intelligent and believable rendering of a man trapped by powerful emotional forces . kate capshaw , best known as either mrs . steven spielberg or "" the girl from the second indiana jones movie "" , renders mrs . potts with the intensity and style of a femme fatale -- sexy , mysterious , and dangerous . the most striking performance , however , belongs to jeremy davies ( spanking the monkey ) , whose interpretation of flyboy is worthy of mention alongside that of dustin hoffman from rain man , tom hanks from forrest gump , billy bob thornton from sling blade , and geoffrey rush from shine . the locusts is as rich in themes as it is in three-dimensional characters . there's atonement , redemption , revenge , and a particularly brutal examination of the shifting balance of power between men and women , and parents and children . but the one with the darkest motivation is mrs . potts , who makes no excuse for her savagery and the manner in which she abuses every kind of power at her disposal . the narrative for the locusts does justice to each of these motifs as it gradually peels back the onion-like layers of the characters to reveal the complexity that lies beneath . the film doesn't offer any simpleminded solutions to difficult issues , and there are two very different ways to interpret the ending ( depending on whether you're an optimist or a pessimist ) . the locusts explores both extremes of the human experience -- the purity of innocence and the viciousness of cruelty -- as well as many of the ambiguous shades in between . if there's one misstep in the locusts , it's that the meaning of the title ( which is a metaphor ) is explained a little too obviously . but that's an extremely minor quibble and it does little to detract from the strength of this film , which is one of the year's best .

"rain man was not about dustin hoffman's raymond babbitt . there are some who find the film overly sentimental , and others who consider hoffman's oscar-winning performance little more than a gimmick , but it's hard to argue that the basic structure of the story wasn't what it had to be . raymond couldn't be that character , because it's absurd to build a narrative around the idea that someone with a profound emotional/psychological condition can decide through a simple act of will to be better . this lesson is offered to explain why chuck & buck , for all the quirky things it does right , is ultimately an experience somewhere between improbable and downright insulting . there's a lot of interesting stuff built into the premise , including a not-particularly-twisty twist that still generates a bit more interest in the chuck/buck dynamic . white's performance as buck is pitched just right , somewhere between endearing and creepy in his striped t-shirt and perpetually blow-pop-stuffed grin . director miguel arteta's choice of digital video seems an ill-advised one dramatically -- why heighten the immediacy and realism of a story centered around somebody's fantasy world ? -- but the technology and hand-held movement are rarely distracting . throw in an infectiously innocuous theme song to set the tone , and you've got the raw material for some solid whacked-out drama and dark comedy . and that raw material is left to rot . but charlie is a huge sucking black hole of a characterization , left utterly bereft of personality or motivations in chris weitz's performance and white's script . he's merely a target of obsession , carelessly created because white never intends for the story to be about anything but buck . chuck & buck's resolution is centered around the idea that 15 years of juvenile infantilism are as easy to toss off as a striped t-shirt . chuck & buck's saving grace is a sub-plot that ultimately has little to do with the ostensibly main plot -- buck's attempt to mount a production of a play he has written about his childhood friendship , called hank & frank . a short film entirely about the play within the play might have been great fun , unburdened by the need for grand third-act shifts of character . chuck & buck sinks thanks to a fundamental misunderstanding of how to structure a plot with a plausible character arc . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"fact or fiction , fairytale : a true story is a fine motion picture . cast from the same mold that shaped a little princess and the secret garden , fairytale is one of those rare family films that has the potential to appeal equally to adults and their offspring . while the movie is likely to make smaller children fidget , those who are old enough to grasp the themes and issues addressed by the movie will find themselves enchanted by the story . and grown-ups will discover that there's enough depth in the material to arrest their attention . in fairytale , children are the ones with insight , who can never be fooled because "" the expect nothing , and so see everything .

"" rationality can be a harsh taskmaster . the film's very title exemplifies this -- children in the audience will have no trouble accepting fairytale as true . adults , on the other hand , will immediately dismiss the "" true story "" part of the title and view this as a well-crafted work of fiction . almost immediately , frances and elsie find that they have a great deal in common , chief of which is a fascination with fairies -- the tiny sprits of the air that only children can see . in fact , by her own admission , elsie knows more about fairies than anyone else alive . as her mother says , "" i'm not sure which frightens me more -- that the children are lying to us or that they're telling the truth . "" fairytale is extraordinarily intelligent and insightful in its approach to the story , blending images of illusion and reality while playing the two off against one another . the film , which is presented from a child's point-of-view , also examines the mysteries of growing up . the realm of children is a magical one , and director charles sturridge understands this . each of the adults in the film reacts differently to the possibility that fairies might exist -- one is awestruck , many are skeptical , and a few are fascinated . fairytale also addresses the one area where faith is most necessary -- the great unknown of death . hoath plays elsie with a quiet seriousness while earl imbues frances with a pixie-like wildness and exuberance . the adult actors , while not often in the foreground , are just as good . harvey keitel remains low-key and unthreatening in his portrayal of houdini . one of the lessons of the bible is that a person who believes without demanding proof shows true faith . fairytale echoes and amplifies that message , adding that the purity of childhood is a necessary ingredient to the unquestioning acceptance of things that defy a rational explanation . this is a story without villains or melodramatic plot twists . it's a simple picture with two very likable , believable young protagonists and an uplifting , optimistic viewpoint . few family films of this caliber reach the screen in any given year , and , to this point , nothing in 1997 has come close . this film deserves much better , and that's the true story .

"with eerie old paintings , large human-like sculptures and creepy corridors , the house looks remarkably like disneyland's haunted mansion . the main difference in the two edifices is that disneyland's is comically frightening , whereas the haunting's is neither comical nor frightening . over-the-top action director jon de bont relegates the human stars to minor roles . since all of their performances are embarrassing , this is perhaps to their advantage . ironically , de bont's claim to fame is speed . most of the haunting appears to be on a quite different drug , valium . the tedium is more likely to bore you to death than scare you with its expensive special effects . only in the outlandish last part does the pacing pick up . as the story slowly advances , the house displays some of its charms . in canonical horror movie fashion , doors come alive and spirits move about . most of the time , however , the movie relies on lots of low base rumbling . the effects on audiences are likely to be profoundly muted . the movie works only if you can ignore how serious the participants are taking it and assume it must be a parody . the problem with this approach is that it's just not funny .

"taylor hackford's the devil's advocate has many laudable qualities , but subtlety is not among them . and , in what is arguably the most believable aspect of the movie , the devil's advocate takes lawyer-bashing to its logical extreme by making lucifer the head of a prestigious law firm . see what i mean -- no subtlety . that being said , the devil's advocate is a highly-enjoyable motion picture that's part character study , part supernatural thriller , and part morality play . although the film isn't a landmark combination of unique elements ( viewers will find themselves reminded of both the witches of eastwick and the firm ) , it has a lot of energy and the rather long 145-minute running time passes quickly . co-writer tony gilroy ( the cutting edge , dolores claiborne ) , who was brought in by director hackford ( dolores claiborne ) to expand upon jonathan lemkin's original adaptation of andrew niederman's novel , has produced a script that transcends any one specific genre , criss-crossing back and forth from horror to satire to melodrama . kevin's approach to a trial isn't that it's a forum for justice , but a game to be won or lost -- and he is willing to do anything for victory , even if he knows that his client is guilty ( the official term for this kind of person is a "" sleazeball "" ) . of course , this is the kind of over-the-top role that pacino plays best , and his virtuoso performance comes complete with a pair of the kind of monologues that he does better than anyone else working in hollywood today . of all the recent approaches to this role , pacino's dracula-esque method stands alongside the work of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) as the most memorable . although the spotlight shines squarely on pacino , there are other actors in the film . and , while pacino's performance is the best , it's not the most surprising . there are times when reeves lacks the subtlety that would have made this a more multi-layered portrayal , but it's nevertheless a solid job . spicy chalize theron ( trial and error ) is fine as mary ann , bringing equal parts sex appeal and pathos to a surprisingly well-developed role . aside from pacino's performance , the greatest strength of the film is its delicious build-up to an operatic climax . and , although huge parts of the devil's advocate are overblown and overplayed , it's never as silly as it has the potential to be -- and this quality consistently keeps the picture out of the dangerous realm of self-parody . the movie's greatest weakness is its ending , which , by trying to be too clever , ends up cheating the audience of a legitimate conclusion . while there's a sense of closure , it's not an especially satisfying one . oddly enough , with two of the most high-profile horror films of the year ( scream 2 and an american werewolf in paris ) slated for a december release , the devil's advocate may be the best option for a "" halloween flick , "" and the pairing of pacino and reeves should assure it a healthy bow at the box office . it doesn't hurt that the script is more intelligent that one might initially suppose and that the storyline is developed better than the theatrical previews cause it to appear to be . the devil's advocate certainly has problems , chief of which is the subtlety thing , but pacino's performance is so fun to watch that it eclipses the most significant of them .

"when viewing a melodrama like a thousand acres , it's easy to label it as a "" chick flick "" or a "" tearjerker . "" however , such a facile categorization would do the movie a disservice , since it possesses a layer of depth that most films of this sort lack . director jocelyn moorhouse , working from laura jones' adaptation of jane smiley's novel , gives a thousand acres the emotional pitch of fried green tomatoes ( even though the stories are vastly dissimilar ) . although the plot is undeniably overwrought at times , the characters remain strong and reliable , and it's their believability that pulls us through . the story is presented from the point-of-view of fortysomething ginny cook smith ( jessica lange ) , who burdens the film with a voiceover narrative that is occasionally useful , but more often tedious . a thousand acres has a choppy feel , almost certainly the result of the book-to-screen transition , and the pre-epilogue ending happens with surprising suddenness . subplots get short changed and characters seemingly disappear without warning . arguably , the complexity of the storyline may be too ambitious for 100-plus minute running time . nevertheless , moorhouse ( how to make an american quilt ) does a fine job with the material she is given to work with . in lesser hands , this could have turned into little more than another big-screen soap opera . however , by generating an effective rapport between the audience and the main characters , moorhouse gives us some meat to chew on . she also manages to develop a number of multi-dimensional characters by showing the good and bad in everyone . some will doubtless complain that the film engages in routine man-bashing , but anyone who looks carefully will see that the women are nearly as flawed as their male counterparts . three of the four leads give powerful performances . michelle pfeiffer shows an edge that we're unaccustomed to . this isn't a lightweight glamour role , and she is up to the challenge of pulling it off . jason robards manages to bring out both sides of larry -- the evil , lecherous creep and the fumbling , lost old man . only jennifer jason leigh is less-than-impressive , and that's more a function of the lack of exposure and development accorded to her character than a knock on her performance . a thousand acres covers a lot of ground , and raises numerous questions about the demons that some families keep buried . this is the kind of movie that you experience more with your emotions than with your intellect . it's not a dumb film , but its undisputed strength lies in the way it tears at the heart . moorhouse's manipulation is skillful , and that makes it easier to forgive the occasional missteps .

"stanley kubrick's first big financed a film and first film with a major hollywood star . kirk douglas who liked the script , thinking it would give him a chance to work on a quality film with a strong social message , thereby getting his production company to back it . this antiwar film , one of the best ever made , much like renoir's masterpiece "" the grand illusion , "" does a great job of criticizing the role of the french military higher-ups in ww1 . the movie turns most of its attention to the action taking place in a military courtroom court-martial and the interplay between the officer's political manuevering for power . kubrick's masterpiece was more cynical and gritty than renoir's very poetic and humane indictment of war . one reason why this was so , was because it hit harder at those who were its subjects and as a result many country's reacted so vehemently as to officially oppose the film . it should also be pointed out , that the ambitious kubrick rewrote the original script to give the film a more traditional hollywood upbeat ending to it , much to kirk douglas's surprise and disapproval . kubrick , reportedly , wanted the film to be a box office success and was willing to forgo artistic integrity . the controversial ending might be termed a cop-out by many , while others found its sentimentalities quite appropriate and cynical enough . incidentally , in my opinion , the major flaw in paths of glory wasn't the taut script , which was lucid and hard-hitting , but it was in kirk douglas's egomaniacal performance ( though a strong performance and the best one in kirk's career ) . but , as forceful and necessary as kirk's performance was , it still allowed the film to become centered around him , rather than on the universality of the story unfolding in its very natural and engrossing way about the horrors , evils , and insanity of war . kubrick aimed for a critique both of war and of class systems . he accomplished this by pessimistically and cynically showing how the privilege class cares only about themselves and how its power is corrupting . we are told that world war i has dragged on for two years and that it became a stalemate of fortified trenches and heavy casualties . war but then broulard says that a promotion awaits , there will be consideration for another star . after dax says it is not possible to do , mireau says , "" show me a patriot and i'll show you an honest man . "" but mireau , not to be undone in the generosity of the moment , says let's make it 3 and have the 701st's three commanding officers choose one from each outfit . broulard says we better get a court-martial for them and make it legal . angrily , dax turns him down , as broulard looks at him incredulously , as if he were a fool , saying you really cared about saving those three men , you are an idealist . dax tells him to give the men a few minutes . the film is direct and powerful . it wouldn't have been banned for so long if it didn't hit home with its hard message . it is magnificently shot , as the trenches are frighteningly real and incomprehensible to understand until seen . kirk douglas is overwhelming in his stabilizing role , in my opinion too much so . but , nevertheless , his anger is warranted , as he is the emotional glue that holds the film together and gives humanity some measure for hope . though i came away from the film feeling no hope . i was cynical of everyone's motives , including dax's . to call him a hero , as the ending of the film implies by its crass sentimentality , as it shows him going back to the front , left me cold . adolphe menjou and george macready came through with outstanding performances , each one an incarnation of machiavellian evil . when on screen , their performances are like machine gun fire directed at you . there is much to chew on idea-wise , despite how simple the film might appear on first viewing it , and thereby lies its true greatness , as it seems to make a timeless argument against war ; and , as in most kubrick films , it is not dated , in fact , it seems to get better with age .

"" i found this scene to be particularly dull and wondered why it was so scripted that bernice had to be told her granny had a lover by max and wouldn't have already have known about it , that is if she was such a caring grandchild as the film wanted her to be portrayed as . the film's quirky resolution comes at the point of a gun or two . it makes some point about getting to know the one you fall in love with . since i didn't find much comedy here ( only a lot of silliness ) and wasn't taken in with the characters or their troubles , i merely went along for the bumpy ride and tried not to wince too much at the forced comedy situations . this film could have used hartley's magical cinematic touch big time and a tighter script if it was going to take me somewhere i hadn't been before .

"this is a movie without plot and with precious little characterization . it moves along at a snail's pace , progressively losing more and more of the audience as it becomes apparent that absolutely nothing is going to happen . the long day closes is very much the visual equivalent of a verse or a poem : beautiful images , but no narrative ( that's not to imply that poems often don't have deeper meanings ) . this movie is a visual feast and a cinematographer's dream , but for the average movie-goer , eighty-three minutes of odd camera-angles and interesting shots is too much . the audience at the showing i attended numbered about twenty at the start of the film . personally , i don't think the movie was bad enough to walk out on , but i can understand why those who left did so . movies can survive without coherent stories if they have solid , three-dimensional characters . the long day closes has neither and , as a result , ends up being an overly-long bore . numerous opportunities for character development are left dangling , and we're forced to watch a bunch of people we never get to feel for . even bud , who's in nearly every scene , is flat and uninteresting . that's an interesting notion , and in the context of the movie , it's easy to see how this could be the case- a great deal of attention is paid to the smallest details . unfortunately , except in unusual circumstances , the mundane recollections of a person aren't the kinds of cinematic gems designed to captivate an audience . there are a few incidents in the long day closes that briefly caught my attention , but they couldn't hold it . on those rare occasions when the film managed to strike a responsive chord within me , it let the opportunity slip away . then it was back to staring at meaningless images on the screen again . i can't recommend the long day closes to any but the most devout art film students and die-hard lovers of unusual cinematography . for anyone else that happens to see this movie , they will likely find the title a fitting one . after getting out of the theater , it will certainly seem like it's been a long day .

"is there a market for bland and predictable children's films ? given the dearth of kids' movies , the answer has to be yes . with millions of kids hungry for movies , this means it is hard for kids' films to flop unless the producers are profligate spenders . into this tradition of non-offensive fare for our youngsters , walt disney productions in 1995 gave them a present called a kid in king arthur's court . although it sounds like something from the great mark twain and they even give him a mention in the credits , the film is merely movie mush . it will fill the kids up , but little more . do not get me wrong , there are the occasional good moments in the picture , but most of it is sleep inducing . things are not going well in camelot . joss ackland plays his part the same way in every movie only the character's name changes . there isn't even a round table . in everyone of these films as well as in heavenly creatures she performed brilliantly . although she does the best she can in this kids' movie , her part is hopelessly dull . the movie comes alive periodically from some of the lines in script by michael part and robert l . levy . most of the script however is leaden . take for example the king's musing , "" camelot rots , and i play at being king . i want her great again .

"this is a pointless b- film actioner , a remake of the gritty 1971 british noir classic directed by mike hodges , which had the good fortune to have michael caine be the star and to have a story with an edge to it . this "" get carter "" features mindless violence , an incoherent and uninvolving story , and most unfortunately the humorless presence of the miscast stallone as a vegas mob enforcer , going to seattle for the funeral of his bartender brother he hasn't seen for a long time . he is dressed in a tacky bright blue suit , sports a goatee , and speaks in a low voice . it is filmed amid some dazzling night shots of las vegas casinos and shots of a rainy seattle , though the rain has no effect on stallone's suit , it never gets soaked no matter how much he exposes it to the elements . it's a clich ? movie . . . so predictable , that if you didn't want to see the way the sleazy bad guys were going to get payback for what they did , you could have left the theater and figured out which way this macho stylish film was going by yourself . you would have missed nothing , there is absolutely nothing interesting about this film . it seems that stephen kay has taken a perfectly taut original film , which was nasty and unremitting to the core , and made a mess of the remake by trying to clean it up , making it into a sleazy film , nevertheless , but one with no redeeming features . he tries to give the film a moment of acting , hugging his niece in a warm embrace , as behind her back he grimaces with obvious pain on his teary face , assuring the audience to pay little attention to this human gesture , they shouldn't worry , he hasn't gone soft , there's going to be a payback . the most disgusting role in the film is reserved for "" gazillionaire "" computer geek alan cumming , he is the simpering coward , the most unmanly and therefore the most unseemly one in the film . it could have been built as the battle between the sleaze champ vs . the egomaniac . it's an undeveloped role , but caine is so good at getting credibility for his character , someone who pretends to have nothing to gain from the murder , who could therefore be honest about what happened , but is , of course , somehow involved in the cover-up . there are several other sleazes around , who have various things to add to the story , such as more gratuitous violence and a seamy look at their lives . since carter fails to heed such warnings , these two will clash in seattle . anyway , no minor b-thriller should be without such a car chase . the only positive spin i could put on this morose work , is to say that it could have been a lot worse , stallone could have talked in a loud voice . this is just another in a long list of films since the 1980s to try and resurrect sylvester stallone's "" comeback .

"this original youth film , that has the look of a pseudo-documentary but is a work of fiction , with the nonprofessional actors seemingly changing mid-scene from reading a script to doing ad-libs , fails to answer the simple questions i put to it about what it is trying to accomplish . this is director and writer , harmony korine's ( screenwriter for kids ) , debut film as a director , accomplished with all the verve and necessary shock and schlock he can muster . what results is a pointless but engaging romp through a midwestern fictional suburban city , xenia , ohio , and its dysfunctional inhabitants , mostly white redneck youth , who either seem retarded or prone to violence , as they are searching for something to do with themselves in a city still suffering from the devastations of a tornado . korine is non-judgmental about any of his characters . but is that necessarily a good thing ? what saves this film from being a complete absurdity , is the raw energy exhibited by the director , as he is on the cutting edge of cinema verite , showing the pent-up hostility and alienation these trashy young people have . he seems to be painting his words with images of the most freakish things you can see in america's wasteland , and not caring whether you believe what you are seeing or not--his aim seems to be to shock the audience and for the audience to respond and say how "" hip "" he is to be showing us all these revolting and boring images . but is that enough to make this a satisfactory film ? two skin head teens senselessly punching it out with each other for an interminable amount of time in their kitchen for fun and macho pride . but by showing all these freaks , is the director not just using them without any purpose but to exploit their oddness ? is this funny scene a comment on single-moms ? the film has an attention disorder disturbance of its own , as it keeps going at random from one vignette to another , without any deciferable plot or storyline , which should be a real treat for heavy metal enthusiasts with low attention spans and those who respect the personal creative nature of film and can overcome the depravity of what they are seeing and its immature fixations , and be impressed with the film's originality . for those lucky souls , they have found a film that is a rarity . but have they found a good film ? others who might like this film , could be taken in by the audaciousness of the director's style and the fast-pace of the film and its easy disposable use of images . but to its credit , the film does capture some of the fears the youths have about growing up and it does show that there are no role models around to help the children . but does the filmmaker really care about what he is seeing ? this film will probably be viewed as one that you either hate or love , and no one can convince you otherwise . since i was caught being in a voyeuristic mode by some of the film , then found myself tuning it out as i became bored with it ; i , therefore , can only say that the film did not work for me . it is hard for me to warm up to those who kill cats , yet i wanted to see how the minds of such people work . that i found out . which is the problem i had with watching the film , as i felt that i didn't need a mind to see it . this film lacked the needed pathos to make the youngsters' story seem more than a provocative freak show ; it failed to offer some meaning to their life , which resulted in giving the film a disjointed look , even though korine should be applauded for sticking to his personal vision . but , the final question is , do you think the director is really interested in showing us anything but a freak show ?

"date released : 5/28/93 running length : 1 : 50 rated : pg-13 ( language , mature themes , sexual situations , brief nudity ) yeah , there are a lot of implausibilities in this script , but the story moves along snappily enough that most of them are easily overlooked . more difficult to miss is richard benjamin's occasionally inadequate direction . there are numerous scenes that could have been a whole lot funnier had benjamin been more deft in choreographing them . too often , he is heavy-handed , but the film survives in spite of him . the first half of made in america is highly amusing . comedy is divided nicely between the outrageous and the subtle ( although bejamin likes to "" point out "" the less obvious moments by using tricks such as slow-motion ) . unfortunately , the comic momentum fades as the film moves to a climax , with the big "" plot twist "" near the end seeming like something out of bad television melodrama . there are a lot of different ways that the story could have gone ; the route it chooses is less-than-satisfying . surprisingly , although this is billed as a romantic comedy , i didn't find the romance between sarah and hal of particular note . despite the rumors linking goldberg and danson together off-screen , there doesn't seem to be much chemistry between them . i could believe these , which are at times touching and sweet , and on other occasions laced with bitterness . there's no question that the best performance is given by nia long . goldberg and danson don't have to stretch much to keep in character . never have i been more impressed with ms . tilly's acting than when she stares into the camera with that vacuous expression . one of the failures of made in america is in the way it introduces the two main characters . at the outset of the film , both sarah and hal are portrayed as irresponsible , arrogant , and thoroughly dislikeable . although they soften as the story progresses , and the audience gradually warms to them , this is not a positive way to start a movie . it's typical in a romantic comedy for one of the partners to be acerbic and unpleasant , but it's unusual for this to be true of both of them . had the comedy been less fresh , made in america might have lost me early on . as far as comedies go , this one is above-average , primarily because there aren't many clunkers among its jokes . character development is so-so , and there are number of problems , some of which are significant , about the way the story progresses during the last half-hour . overall , however , made in america is enjoyable . it handles the issue of a mixed-race relationship sensitively ( instead of sensationalistically ) and presents an intriguing look at a very different family dynamic .

"forces of nature ( dreamworks ) starring : sandra bullock , ben affleck , maura tierney , steve zahn , blythe danner , ronny cox , stephen schiff . screenplay : marc lawrence . producers : susan arnold , donna arkoff roth and ian bryce . director : bronwen hughes . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , drug use ) running time : 105 minutes . i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool . i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement . this was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm . then marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups . forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start , setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue . sandra bullock , for her part , is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films combined , avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping . the two performances -- part of a great top-to-bottom cast -- are effective and connected from the start , yet the script's apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely . lively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis , forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self-justification . the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose , leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution . forces of nature isn't about a man developing a fear of commitment ; it's about a man learning what commitment means _to him_ , learning that it's not what he thought it was . lawrence's script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending , an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense . earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance , and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine . though one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film , and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples , forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you'll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom . that is , provided you're not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes . for a brisk romantic comedy , forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the year : teetering hand-held shots , why-not low or high angles , sweeping pans . occasionally the hyper-real approach works , with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance ; far more often , hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is , covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can't find what's underneath . a script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director , but even hughes' excesses can't spoil this unique concoction . forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant , something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"screenplay : alvin sargent , based on the novel by mona simpson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 114 minutes . for a long time during anywhere but here , my attention was fixed somewhere i didn't quite expect . relationship dramas like this tend to be all about character and performance -- every scene is an actor's scene , every moment is an actor's moment . but to my surprise , i became fascinated with the way the film looked . the grainy film stock renders everything slightly fuzzy ; the bleached colors suck the golden glow out of tinseltown . i mean no disrespect to mr . deakins or to the craft of cinematography when i say that , even at the time , i knew anywhere but here couldn't have been working the way it was supposed to if i was paying attention to the choice of film stock . it's been done before , of course -- even the kooky mother and more stable daughter has been done before , in films like mermaids -- but solid writing and strong performances can often counteract familiarity . anywhere but here does come through with the strong performances . their scenes together effectively capture the perpetual tension between ann and adele , and do a particularly nice job of showing ann's frustration at being the real grown-up of the two while never turning her into a wise-ass . and that may be why anywhere but here feels so claustrophobic and artificial . we see ann walking uncomfortably through beverly hills high on her first day of school , but there's no sense of her struggle before she's giggling away with girlfriends ; a few scattered scenes of adele in her job as a speech pathologist/therapist provides no sense for why this flighty woman ever got into a field that demands so much patience . most disappointing , there's far too little background on their lives in wisconsin for us to understand why adele wants to leave and ann wants to stay , and far too little development of the potentially intriguing relationship between ann and her almost-kissing-cousin benny ( shawn hatosy ) . there's really not a single strong supporting character anywhere but here can bounce off of . it's no wonder these two drive each other crazy -- they've been hermetically sealed away from the rest of the world . one could argue that such an isolated , in-each-other's-face relationship is precisely the point of anywhere but here -- that ann and adele have nothing in the world but each other , crazy-making as they may be to each other . that doesn't make it any easier to spend two hours with them -- and only them -- and their conflicts , well-acted though they may be . and of course there was the cinematography , which -- while thematically appropriate -- also reminded me what anywhere but here was missing . this is a drama too lacking in background color . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"german-born director michael haneke ( "" funny games "" / "" 71 fragments of a chronology of chance "" ) continues to make fascinating and diverse films about morality . code unknown is a film marked by its documentary style of filmmaking , as it attempts to look in a realistic way at the immigration of people from all over the world to paris . by using shots with long-takes , the director is able to capture in the facial expressions the various moods that strike his subjects . there's an inherent violence in western europe and there's a mixture of races that can easily be seen in the street scenes , the filmmaker tries to see how a modern european city in the midst of such population changes for its white country handles itself . in this episodic film there are several unconnected stories that seem to be leading nowhere , but are followed through at various points of the film ; the film is devoid of plot and relies on the viewer to make their own observations from what unfolds . this is a brilliantly done art film , offering a detached view of immigration according to the way an outsider sees it . it doesn't come to any grand conclusions , at least none that we haven't seen before , but its way of telling its story holds our interest and should be a rewarding film for those who have an interest in observing things in minute details . it was an excellent idea to have a series of long-takes so we can view the african family in action , the romanian woman dealing with her compatriots back in romania and then desperately sneaking back into paris to try and earn some money , and how the french family is also disengaged by the modern times . there's a sense of loss here , but there's also an excitement about what all this change could stir up . some might see it just as a film -- the way binoche views her actress role in the film within the film , who laughs at it when she sees herself on film . there's a special emotional quality about "" code unknown "" that allows paris to be seen in its lies . the film convincingly shows how hard it is for different cultures to communicate with others , and even though this has been said before the film's method of getting to that conclusion is the thing to look for here .

"what can you say about this set in baltimore film , by the king of bad taste , john waters , except it is what can be expected from the director whose type of rebellious childish low-budget indie films have now become passe since his peak days of the 1970s , when he made "" pink flamingos . "" now his satire has become more tame than outrageous . it is ironic that the director made a film railing about the poor quality of a hollywood film and has made a film that is equally as bad , if not worst . this is a shoddy production , the comedy is lame , the acting almost non-existent , and the satire is sophomoric , taking pop shots at an easy target such as hollywood , but shots that have no sting . if i laughed more , then i could have found some justification for the film . at best , this "" demented "" could be seen as a tv sketch on "" saturday night live , "" or a straight to video movie release . as a full-length feature , it ran out of gas shortly after the initial kidnapping scene and went quickly downhill due to a lack of subtlety and the film's inability to be challenging or get at what is really troubling about pop culture . it certainly can't be because the theaters still make popcorn in cocoanut oil and people who go to theaters in the mall talk during the film . demented rants that he is quite willing to die for art and will do anything to make his film . -- to her enthusiasm about changing her image and acting in their film , made for some of the most amusing scenes in the film . the kidnapping scene had some energy in it before even that became tiresome . there was some gentle digs at hollywood : from poking fun at a pauly shore film marathon to the mall showing only "" star wars "" and "" star trek "" films to the set of the expensive remake of "" forrest gump "" being taken over by the guerillas to `les enfants du paradis' panned for being insultingly dubbed in english to mocking the maryland film commission to the "" patch adams "" film showing of a director's cut in the mall . these were easy targets and the comedy wasn't that funny or radical . it might have been funny on paper but when acted out , it seemed to be mild stuff , things even mainstream films do in a more daring way these days . everyone in the film is bursting at the seams thinking about sex , but cecil has outlawed sex until the movie is completed , so they all live by being sexually frustrated and some are even confused about what kind of sexuality fits them . there's not much to prove by the kidnapping , as the story is really irrelevant . the thing here is if the character can shock you and if the film hit your funny bone . for me , it came up close to empty in all respects . i'll take my deranged films from andy warhol anytime , whose freaks are really freaky and whose stories have more of an edge to them . here , dorff is good enough as the abby hoffman characterization of a punk who has gone completely mental as a deranged artist , while griffith is a good sport , taking in all the remarks about honey's age , her ego-centredness , her tantrums , her phony public demeanor and her defense of the kind of film she made a reputation on as a hollywood star , first defending and then renouncing it . but i wouldn't call her performance acting , as she was mainly around to play a prop of herself to be used as a source for the comedy . the satire was not tough enough to make this a biting film , but rather one that has no claws to scratch and no gumption to really antagonize anyone but the christian right-wing moralists . and since it can still at least do that , no matter how trivial this film is , i guess , the film has a little fire in its belly . . . by the way , water's stated in an interview that the film got its title "" cecil b . demented , "" because that's what he was called in an early review .

"screenplay : stephen peters . director : john mcnaughton . mpaa rating : r ( adult themes , sexual situations , nudity , profanity , drug use , violence ) running time : 113 minutes . if hollywood is going to insist on making awful films , the least it could do is make them as wonderfully , hilariously awful as wild things . there is a kind of zen preposterousness certain films achieve -- oh , let's use showgirls as an example -- which makes them too much fun to dismiss . they become impromptu "" mystery science theater "" experiences , where you find yourself hooting and commenting throughout the ridiculous situations , plaster-of-paris acting and quotably appalling dialogue . i'm not entirely sure that wild things isn't a huge , self-aware joke , attempting to combine the joe eszterhas oeuvre ( showgirls , basic instinct , jade ) and grade-z exploitation films bursting with busty women in the swamps . for the next 100 minutes or so it spins off into a dozen different twists and turns of double-dealing , accompanied by the kind of non-stop sleaze which would make eszterhas proud . soap opera threats snarled through clenched teeth ? yep . career-threatening performances ? you betcha . check . chicks in wet t-shirts ? check . gratuitous full-frontal shower shot of detective ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) which reveals -- ahem -- just precisely how many degrees of kevin bacon there are ? and yet , as undeniably wretched as virtually every moment of wild things is , i can't imagine anyone walking out on it . the same kind of perverse i-only-read-it-for-the-articles voyeurism which finds otherwise sensible people pausing when they flip past jerry springer could have you shaking your head and giggling non-stop . in fact , the pseudo-serious but scandal-grubbing television coverage of lombardo's trial in wild things serves as an apt metaphor for what we should be expecting from the film . there's no way to take wild things seriously as a movie , any more than it's possible to take "" melrose place "" seriously as topical drama or "" hard copy "" seriously as journalism . it's a lowest-common-denominator side show of all the stuff we mock with knee-jerk superiority , yet still manages to do gangbuster ratings . it is only a tremendously entertaining supporting turn by bill murray which makes it hard to forgive wild things all its trespasses . as lombardo's ambulance-chasing attorney , murray brings a genuine comic touch to the proceedings , one which doesn't force you to stop laughing to figure out whether the humor is intentional . even the film's extended closing credits coda , which back-tracks to explain how all the plotting comes together , feels like a huge miscalculation . if it matters that much whether or not the plot makes sense , then wild things really _is_ that bad . perhaps it's just the eternal optimist in me which makes me want to believe there was a logic behind the perverse inanity -- or perhaps that's inane perversity -- of wild things . or perhaps it's the need to find a reason why i'd rather sit through a film as bad as wild things again before i'd sit through a "" better "" film like twilight . i can't even call it a "" guilty pleasure , "" because it's not the film i enjoyed . i did , however , immensely enjoy the act of _not_ enjoying it . start-to-finish trash just doesn't get much trashier than this , unless a certain writer's name is attached to the script . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"intimate relations is the latest in a long line of films that claims to have been inspired by real events . this is one of those instances , however , when i could care less whether or not the movie is based on a true story -- the knowledge certainly doesn't add anything to the viewing experience . nevertheless , for some reason , it seems important to first-time director philip goodhew that we recognize that at least the bare-bone facts of intimate relations are culled from the historical record . of far more interest than the "" based on a true story "" aspect is the film's central theme about the inherent hypocrisy of a "" morally upright "" ( or should that be "" uptight "" ) society . there has been and always will be a human preoccupation with sex . the only thing that changes with the years is how the culture deals with this basic concept . appearances meant everything , and people would go to extraordinary lengths to seem above moral reproach , even if the truth was much different . it's possible to see intimate relations as a dark comedy , but it's really more of an attack on the hypocritical attitudes that pervade society in every era . our society may claim to be more liberal and permissive in the '90s , but sexual secrets are still the most closely guarded , and , if they get into the open , have the greatest potential to damage . appearances still count for more than reality . plot-wise , intimate relations is nothing special . the film is too long and too repetitive -- we get the point well before the final , inevitable act . in many ways , this movie seems to be trying to recapture the spirit and feel of peter jackson's courageous , original heavenly creatures . indeed , there are some similarities -- the slightly exaggerated fashion with which '50s families are depicted , the way that simple domestic discord grows into something that's increasingly more ominous , and the manner in which obsession is shown to short-circuit all rational thought . intimate relations is a more pedestrian film , however . it lacks the artistry and the character depth that jackson brought to his breakthrough feature . it's a little chilling how easily her character switches from the british version of june cleaver ( who would rather "" be dead than brazen "" ) to the pathetic , sex-starved woman who crawls her way into howard's bed every night . newcomer laura sadler , who plays marjorie's teenage daughter , brings an appealing mix of innocence , eroticism , and cunning to the most complex role in the film . ultimately , i appreciated the ideas in intimate relations more than the presentation . things feel a little too over-familiar at times , as if i've seen them before , and it isn't hard to guess how the story will end ( consequently , it seems to take forever to get to that point ) . also , from time-to-time , the characters are designed more as tools to be used in service of goodhew's themes than as unique individuals . these elements conspire to weaken the film just enough that the mixture of drama , suspense , and dark comedy fails to gel properly . as a result , while intimate relations makes an important statement , it does so in a forum that often feels clunky and awkward .

"the production notes trumpet the matchmaker as "" a romantic comedy for people who hate romantic comedies . "" this statement implies that the film has something exceptionally original or daring to offer those who are tired of screen love affairs that follow a predictable trajectory from point a to point b . in fact , it's false advertising . there's nothing remotely special about the romantic component of this picture -- it's strictly boy meets girl , boy loses girl due to a silly misunderstanding , and boy gets back together with girl in time for the end credits . so why would anyone who hates romantic comedies like this one ? presumably because the film makers believe that janeane garofalo is the type of atypical leading lady who will attract a more cynical audience . indeed , she shows the same unselfconscious charm in the matchmaker that made her character so irresistible in cats and dogs . the primary difference is that the script for this film has a confused sense of what it wants to accomplish , and , as a result , director mark joffe ( cosi ) is unable to utilize garofalo's talents fully . the film begins conventionally enough . unfortunately , instead of just allowing the story to coast along through familiar romantic comedy terrain , the film makers choose to bring back the political sideshow during the final half-hour . this might have been okay had the material been well-written , but it's all trite and derivative . the matchmaker's script doesn't offer one observation about the american political process that hasn't been presented many times before , frequently in better movies . worse still , as this aspect of the plot attains pre- eminence during the closing twenty minutes , marcy and her romantic situation are crowded out . maybe the reason romantic comedy haters are supposed to appreciate this film is because , after a hour's buildup , the love story gets shortchanged . also , since the movie was shot on location in ireland , a dash of the local color and scenery gets thrown into the mix , and there don't seem to be as many stereotypes as one might normally expect from a production of this nature . however , while the romantic stuff here works , the unsavvy and unappealing political material proves to be a constant irritant ( and leads to the film's worst moment -- a short , preachy speech on ethics delivered in strident tones by garofalo ) . as a result , the movie's marriage of true love and cynical campaigning turns out to be less than a match made in heaven .

"every time audiences are presented with a reasonably well-made serial killer movie , they line up for it . why ? human beings are irresistibly fascinated by the lurid , the horrifying , and the depraved , and what could be more attention-grabbing than an individual who murders repeatedly in sick and twisted ways ? of course , serial killers ( both real and fictional ) have provided material for countless movies , but most of those are artless hack jobs , replacing tension and intelligence with gore and cliches . so , when a movie comes along that's a cut above the usual , it's worth making note of . kiss the girls is such a film . i'm not saying that kiss the girls is a great motion picture , nor am i arguing that it's the best of its kind to come out in recent years . but it features a pair of well-developed characters , the plot contains some clever twists and turns , the dialogue is reasonable , and director gary fleder ( things to do in denver when you're dead ) keeps the level of tension and intrigue high . put together , all of that adds up to a worthwhile motion picture . fans of seven , copycat , and silence of the lambs will likely agree that their $8 admission for kiss the girls is well spent . kiss the girls wouldn't be nearly as involving without the two strong performances of the leads . freeman plays alex as an insightful , confident investigator with powerful emotions bubbling just beneath his calm , carefully-controlled exterior . as kate , judd adds another impressive performance to a growing resume . the actress plays her character as outwardly-tough and self-sufficient with an inner core of vulnerability . nevertheless , vulnerability , whether emotional or physical , is something she has a hard time coping with . one thing i appreciate about kiss the girls is its willingness to spend time developing the characters before jumping into the main story . there are times when it manifests itself almost as a father/daughter bond , but , on other occasions , there's a sense of latent romance . however , the film underplays this dynamic to avoid wandering off on a tangent . despite being consistently involving , kiss the girls , based on the best-selling novel by james patterson , has its share of flaws . on several occasions , the film's blatant ignorance of real-world police procedures strains the viewer's credibility . i also have a gripe about the end scenes , which are overly familiar . with one exception , the acting is solid . although elwes only portrays a small-town cop , and doesn't steal any scenes , he's never particularly believable , and every time he's on screen , he sticks out like a sore thumb . the film makers , with a nod to the success of seven , have apparently decided to mimic the grim atmosphere and in-your-face cinematography of that movie ( light , darkness , and shadow are used to great effect here ) . stylistically , kiss the girls is very similar , and the presence of morgan freeman only heightens the connection . even though there are vast plot differences between the two , both are well- made and are likely to appeal to the same kind of audience . so , much like seven , kiss the girls makes for a suspenseful , if somewhat bleak , two hours .

"perhaps most significantly , american beauty became a critical and popular success with its cynical take on the facade of suburban bliss . it doesn't take long for a film's entire context to change . could judy berlin avoid feeling instantly , jarringly out-of-step ? in the case of judy berlin , such concerns probably seem silly , since its style is already so surreal and timeless . if judy berlin looks and plays like a suburban spin on a woody allen ensemble comedy , it shouldn't be surprising ; mendelsohn spent years as an assistant costume designer for allen films . essentially it's a character study , exploring the submerged longings of its suburban denizens that come to the surface only when the eclipse causes time to stand still . the veteran cast members deliver some superb performances , particularly kahn in a very funny yet very sad piece of work , and barrie as the not-well-liked teacher with an unknown inner life . judy berlin manages to hit some effective comic notes while always staying true to the small , very personal desires of even its peripheral characters . mendelsohn's main characters , however , fare less well . the title of the film tells us to focus on the interaction between david and judy as the thematic center , and , unfortunately , the center doesn't hold . david exists primarily as a stand-in for the filmmaker -- the frequent , nudgy references to the fact that we're watching a story that's going to be turned into a film don't help matters -- and hornick doesn't do enough with what is there . it's a very entertaining performance as an endearing character , but judy is more a symbol of possible escape than a fully-realized person . while david's mopey self-loathing may ultimately come in for affectionate mockery , that doesn't make it any easier to latch on to him as a protagonist , or to care about the fate of david and judy's relationship . even when he fumbles one of his sub-plots , mendelsohn keeps judy berlin enough on the sweet side of bittersweet that it remains appealing . the look ( jeffrey seckendorf's black-and-white cinematography ) and sound ( michael nicholas's piano and harpsichord score ) may contribute much to judy berlin's sense of timelessness , but the story itself plays a significant role . the characters in the film spend much of the running in place because they're always looking behind them . how refreshing to find a film that suggests there's something to look forward to -- even in the suburbs . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"did you ever get the feeling that brian depalma designs entire films around set pieces he thinks would be really cool ? think about mission : impossible -- can you recall more than a few scattered seconds aside from the computer room break-in and the train tunnel finale ? the trivial business of building a story between cool sequences frequently seems to bore him ; if there were a directorial equivalent for "" script doctor , "" he'd probably be all over it . that opening reel is a nice piece of work , and an ideal showcase for cage at his bug-eyed , manically-grinning finest . there's a kinetic artistry to the scene as depalma captures the excitement at the event , the shark-like constant motion of our protagonist , and the unstable nature of the events about to occur . we recognize instantly that for every pie in atlantic city , there's rick santoro with his fingers deeply immersed or doing his best to dip them in . we also recognize that somewhere in the dizzying scene are the clues to what will come next . what will come next is an investigation of the shoting which often feels like an afterthought . the story's arc is clearly designed to lead santoro towards a redemptive choice -- cash vs . the right thing -- but it seems to take an awful lot longer than 90 minutes to get there . and that's not to say that snake eyes doesn't move . in fact , depalma rarely stops moving , mixing up extended point-of-view sequences with tautly-edited pursuits , throwing in a drifting overhead pan through a series of hotel rooms for good measure . snake eyes has technical virtuosity and sheer forward momentum to spare . what's missing is heart , a reason to care about stringing depalma's shiny individual baubles together into cinematic jewelry . by the climax , depalma seems to have lost all focus on making snake eyes a redemption thriller , hinging a pivotal sequence on a turn of the weather . between that stormy sequence , the extended speeches in which the villains explain their motivation , and the tagged-on romantic coda , you may find yourself wondering what the point of it all could be . i suppose snake eyes could satisfy an audience as a display of craftsmanship , but that really defines why so few of depalma's films satisfy as stories . he's not really a film-maker . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"their latest offering is something called china moon , a film noir featuring the unlikely pairing of ed harris with madeleine stowe . this movie , which bears a 1991 date , is not like a fine wine--age has not improved it ( in fact , in the three-plus years since it was filmed , ms . stowe has gone to some lengths to distance herself from the production ) . after exchanging a few bad lines of dialogue , rachael and kyle recognize the attraction , although they don't act on it--at least not immediately . as far as thrillers go , this one starts off dead in the water . the first forty minutes are not only dull , but dull in a manner that calls attention to the bad dialogue and obvious plot points . there are instances when the relevance of some little detail is called attention to by everything except a big neon sign saying : "" look ! the second half of china moon almost redeems the first . despite numerous coincidences designed to stretch one's suspension of disbelief to the breaking point , and several truly dumb plot contrivances , it's actually fun to follow all the twists and turns--even if too many of them are predictable . the ending , which displays a willingness to try something a little different , is another source of potential forgiveness . then there are the actors . if you don't listen to 75% of the dialogue ( which sounds like it was written by a seventh-grader hooked on dime-store potboilers ) , the two leads give enjoyable performances . ed harris is generally convincing , as is madeleine stowe , although it should be pointed out that neither role demands a great deal of range . these are pretty much single-dimension performances : the strong , silent detective and the scared , abused wife . on the other hand , the supporting cast doesn't have a clue . charles dance gets into his role as the detestable husband , never once eliciting a glimmer of sympathy from the audience , but his performance seems almost clinical--a sort of act-by-numbers job with a very , very bad southern accent . benicio del toro is absolutely dreadful , and almost every scene that he's in turns into an endurance contest for those watching . basically , for anyone who just wants to see a truly convoluted thriller without considering the logic or intelligence of the serpentine track of the story , china moon isn't a terrible choice . the film is good only by b-movie standards , and as such it offers something in the way of lowbrow entertainment . enjoyability depends largely on how deeply the viewer can immerse him- or herself in the movie's murky waters--something that's an iffy prospect with the combination of mr . del toro's acting and screenwriter roy carlson's often-inane script .

"you get a film with a few subplots in it for the ticket price of one here . but you ultimately get what you pay for , and here the main story becomes tiring and the secondary story is oedipal and underplayed , and the other subplots are pointless , so what you really get is the main story being compromised by the subplots , which weakens the main story into a formula-driven one . the main story is a homage to the movie "" wall street "" and its message of greed but , at least , it comes without the moral piety of oliver stone . yet , he still stays with the firm , something the film couldn't really show why , even though they tried explaining it with a subplot of a ruptured father/son relationship . the story's other subplot is a frenetic tale of white men in their twenties with lots of testosterone to burn , who just want to be millionaires and don't care how they do it . the dialogue is schmaltzy and unconvincing ; their hard sell techniques are sleazy and leave the characters soulless , and the 'homeboy' attitudes displayed by their after-work hijinks- of pub crawling , looking for fights and girls , leaves a lot to be desired . father and son had a tension between them that made for some melodramatic moments . but this is clearly a film about young people with unbridled energy who are clueless about how to live their lives without copying someone else's idea of what the good life is . and because they are so dull-witted and deliver lines without the gift of gab that a writer like david mamet presents his stars with , in his glengarry glen ross , the film lags in scope . but through the device of quick-paced editing , it appears to be moving to some sort of rapid resolution . its moral theme might be , if you get rich so fast , you must be ready to fall quickly . the characters here are just low-level white collar hustlers , the amoral garden variety kind , and their distasteful conduct and empty lives spark no interest . these are the kind of telemarketers that the american public has been inundated with over the recent years , with no end in sight . since the film doesn't humanize them , but allows them to be the monsters they really are , it is indeed a hard sell to find this film as anything but a look at the ugly side of outlaw capitalism . the movie has a lot of energy and zeroes in on an unhealthy segment of the population whose lure for working is solely for material things , such as fancy cars , not giving a hoot how ethical their job is . its company name j . t . in the background hip-hop music blares away . this is a film geared for young people , its target audience is probably made up of those who liked last year's overrated nihilistic fight club . a romance is brought into the film as another subplot , but is never fully developed to be anything but superficial . she shuns greg and goes for his underling seth , in a romance that has about as much spark in it as a firecracker that fizzles out in your hand . why this interracial romance develops and how it suddenly ends , doesn't amount to hill or beans . the best thing about the film was the performance of vin diesel as chris , a seasoned hustler of stocks and bitter rival of greg's . there is a certain power in his character , a believability about what he is doing there that seemed more intense than seth's fall and redemption . the film would have been better off focusing in on his story ; it would have remained true to its cynical premise about the youth it features . this story is at best , about a theme that was done before in films such as "" wall street "" and "" tin men , "" but this time with even more cynicism and more of an edge to it . the picture itself is a hustle , trying to sell you something by pretending it has something to say , if you hold onto to its premise without selling it short . underneath the closeness of the boys in the boiler room , there are some underlying problems in their relationships besides the usual ones of competiveness . and chris shoots back , "" why don't you go make me a latke , dreidel boy ?

"another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like "" waking ned devine , "" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . the strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . the film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia . everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . the film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . it is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . things work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . ummm !

"the full monty is the third recent dramatic comedy to emerge from the united kingdom to illustrate the effects of unemployment on the individual and the family . like brassed off ! moreso than its two immediate predecessors , however , the full monty is interested in getting the audience to leave the theater with a warm feeling , and , considering this undemanding agenda , it's reasonably successful . no one would ever call the full monty ambitious . in fact , with its confident reliance upon formulaic situations and familiar characters , it's anything but that . most of the credit for the film's success must go to the game troupe of actors and director peter cattaneo , who allows the story to develop in an unforced , easygoing manner . originality may be at a premium here , but the full monty offers plenty of opportunities for laughter and genial smiles . the tremendous crowds that turn out for the event give gaz an idea . if male strippers who don't take it all off can rake in the money , what about those who are willing to show "" the full monty "" ? unlike other recent stripper movies ( showgirls and striptease , for example ) , the full monty throws pretended eroticism out the window . there isn't a sexually provocative moment in the film . the nudity is discretely handled , although the actors did in fact perform a live strip show in front of 400 extras in a sequence that was , according to the director , "" a one-take deal . "" this lends a degree of spontaneity to the full monty that makes the movie's climactic scenes more believable and enjoyable . the degree to which the actors manage to bring their characters to life is a key reason why the full monty is a little better than countless other pictures with similar goals . robert carlyle plays gaz with the right mix of pathos and energy . the actor continues to impress with his range , adding this film to an impressive resume that includes ken loach's riff-raff , michael winterbottom's go now , and the aforementioned trainspotting . tom wilkinson ( sense and sensibility ) has the "" stuck up bastard with a good heart "" role down pat . and , as the overweight dave , mark addy brings to the fore feelings of insecurity that almost anyone can relate to . the full monty is basically about overcoming adversity and succeeding is spite of certain perceived shortcomings ( no pun intended ) . cattaneo borrows a tactic that numerous , recent australian comedies have adopted : incorporating a slew of pop hits into the soundtrack . what the full monty lacks in depth , it makes up for in good will and likeability . this isn't a great movie , but it's breezy , enjoyable , and easy to sit through . and sometimes , even when dealing with a serious issue like unemployment , that can be the perfect tone to drive home a message .

"pi , the mathematical notation , is commonly used to represent the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter . pi is actually the second low-budget , no-effects science fiction movie i have seen this year . i must admit to liking the approach embraced by pi and sticky because the monetary limitations have spawned creative scripts with unique solutions . socially , max is completely inept . his objective is to use his home-built supercomputer , euclid , to analyze the patterns in the financial markets to predict the exact performance of every stock . although the plot of pi is eccentric ( even for a science fiction effort ) , aronofsky's message is actually quite simple : life does not fit into neat patterns , and complete control is impossible . oddly , this is also the underlying premise of the two jurassic park movies , proving that certain concepts are universal . however , the central theme is only one of many fascinating subjects tapped into by the screenplay . for example , max's quest to use numerical patterns to model every aspect of the universe reveals some interesting facts about the hebrew language . aronofsky elected to shoot the film in black-and-white , which lends a dream-like atmosphere to all of the proceedings . pi transports us to a world that is like yet unlike our own , and , in its mysterious familiarity , is eerie , intense , and compelling . reality is a fragile commodity , but , because the script is well-written and the central character is strongly developed , it's not hard to suspend disbelief . as the movie draws to a conclusion , it perhaps becomes a little too ambitious in trying to unify all the great questions of existence . at that point , pi slides with only limited success into an exploration of metaphysics and spirituality . nevertheless , i prefer movies that take risks like this , even when they're flawed , to those that try for a safe , formula-driven resolution . so , while i didn't necessarily buy everything that transpired in the final fifteen minutes , i was surprised by much of it , and aronofsky never lost my attention . for anyone who wants a movie to feed their intelligence and imagination more than their eyes and ears , pi is a solid choice . it probably deserves 3 . 1416 stars , but since my scale doesn't support that , i'll round it off to three .

"i'm sure there are people out there who view beavis and butt-head do american as yet another sign that the end-times are upon us ; they are probably the same folks who have condemned from day one the mtv series on which it is based as a celebration of violence , stupidity and lack of respect . speaking as an admittedly defensive some-time fan of the show , i think "" beavis and butt-head "" is much smarter and more self-aware than its detractors give it credit for being . mike judge created a series for mtv which takes aim at the generation of youth mtv helped create : kids without the attention span to sit through an entire music video . do young viewers of the show sometimes delight in the anarchy and low humor without appreciating the sub-text ? probably , but the same statement is true of "" the simpsons , "" and no one would accuse "" the simpsons "" of not being smart . there's no point in pretending that beavis and butt-head do america doesn't traffic in plenty of below-the-belt gags -- and above-the-belt , where women are concerned -- because that is the level of beavis and butt-head's sense of humor . sex , masturbation , gas and other toilet functions all send the twosome into paroxysms of their trademark immature snickering , yet judge stages many of these moments with a knowing wit . that is not to say that a little beavis and butt-head doesn't go a long way . even fans of the series might find 80 minutes of their antics getting repetitive , particularly when connected to a standard "" mistaken identity "" premise in which morons take such bizarre actions that they are assumed to be brilliant . the series also benefits from the commentary on music videos which breaks up each episode's plot , and that commentary is missed in beavis and butt-head do america . its absence removes the rare opportunities you have to witness how selective their obliviousness can be as they analyze the cliches of videos . judge tosses in some clever bits unrelated to the series , including a great opening credits sequence scored to a "" shaft "" -like isaac hayes tune and voice cameos by cloris leachman and a fellow credited as "" earl hofer "" ( david letterman's nom-de-cinema in cabin boy ) , but most of the gags are directed squarely at fans of the show . the uninitiated might find themselves baffled at the applause which goes up for cornholio , beavis' caffeine- and sugar-fueled alter-ego . a keen grasp of reality prevents me from attempting anything like a conversion of "" beavis and butt-head "" haters . hard-core opponents consider them not just annoying but actively evil , an animated pair of potty-mouthed pauly shores sucking the collective will to think out of the heads of america's impressionable youth . but beavis and butt-head do america , crude though it may be , is more genuinely inventive than space jam and 101 dalmatians combined , and less insulting to the intelligence of younger viewers . all it takes is a very funny moment which underscores the futility of butt-head trying to piece together a rather elementary crime scene to point out that dumb characters don't have to mean a dumb movie . beavis and butt-head do america overcomes its fundamental dopiness to provide entertainment for those prepared to laugh with its self-absorbed protagonists _and_ those prepared to laugh at them .

"an amazingly strange film , confusing and not thoroughly enjoyable , but a film i found more interesting than i thought possible at first viewing . this experimental film in minimalist story telling , a film consisting of disturbing visualizations and almost no dialogue , had a concept that was greater than how the film turned out . it felt at times like i was watching paint dry on the wall , but the reward for sitting through those excruciatingly redundant scenes , was in seeing something different , something that cast a spell of sorcery over a terrible incident , as i believe the film in its unique and sometimes shrill voice does justice in commenting on the violence in american society , especially against women . the film uses its impressions of the marine base as a metaphor for the social violence in today's american society , and to give it its startling look of reality , marines were used as the actors . the plot is simple . the film's boredom is broken up by camera shots of marines in conversations that we can't hear in its entirety but are treated to little snippets of , hearing mostly their curse words . because the film had no linear story and followed no chronological order , and it stressed the mundaneness of life on the base and did not film its story in the usual way a murder investigation is filmed , it appeared surreal . i thought these additions seemed to serve mostly as unneeded arty pretext . the unsettling milieu in which the crime took place , speaks volumes about why the murder might have taken place . the film seems to be telling us that it's up to us to make sense of what we've seen . though the film was dull and did not move me while i was watching it , it did something to me afterwards intellectually , it made me think of a military base , the persian gulf war , and of marital abuse , but it made me think of them without the usual concepts i bring to my thinking cap . does that make this a great film ? no . but it makes it an interesting one , a film that i can't easily dismiss . its filming of the arrest is so chilling and memorable because what is so dull and ordinary about the crime scene , is the understated reason for the origin of the violence , contrary to the way hollywood films portray violence . here it is a part of the landscape that one regularly sees but , perhaps , one doesn't really understand or want to understand what evil society has created .

"one of the most disturbing elements of any organized protest of this sort is that most of those involved will not have seen the picture in question . another equally unfortunate byproduct is that , as was the case with the last temptation of christ , the movie itself may get lost somewhere in the resulting polarization . if that happens , it will be a shame , because priest has a lot to say , and doesn't deserve to be hamstrung by those who miss the point or have no idea what they're talking about . there is nothing in priest that hasn't appeared in recent newspaper accounts , which makes the catholic league's opposition to the film somewhat ludicrous , not to mention hypocritical . perhaps they feel threatened by priest's depiction of men of the cloth as flawed human beings rather than as icons . certainly , the men who don the collar here are not perfect , but neither are they lunatics , epicureans , or devils . jimmy mcgovern's script does an excellent job of dovetailing the two main elements of the film--greg's homosexuality and lisa's sexual abuse--into a compelling whole , often using unexpected bursts of humor to keep the level of tension from becoming too intense . arguably , the more stirring story centers on the priest's battles with his conscience over how to help lisa , but this film wouldn't have the same emotional resonance without the other pieces . in fact , the final scene incorporates several threads into a moment that , while perhaps a little overdone , is nonetheless powerful . at its core , however , is the question of absolute certainty versus faith . there is , of course , no answer to most of the questions that greg agonizes over , but these--such as how christ could expect him to keep silent when that silence condemns a girl to continued suffering--are presented for the audience's consideration . provocative films like priest rarely arrive without creating some sort of controversy . by not compromising her vision ( which is similar to that of fellow british film maker ken loach ) , director antonia bird has fashioned a picture that not only stirs up a hornet's nest of timely and volatile spiritual issues , but faces up to homosexuality and incest with a frankness which few films dare . priest is effective not only because of all the ground it traverses , but because the final turn brings closure without excess .

"i have this sneaking suspicion that the extent to which viewers can appreciate dazed and confused may be limited by how readily they recognize it as a perfect capsule of mid-70s youth culture . it's a clever and completely un-self-conscious portrait of pot-smoking , beer-drinking teenagers revelling in the awareness that right now , nothing else really matters . as frequently as people tend to toss out comparisons between films , i think i can safely say that what american graffiti was to 1962 , dazed and confused is to 1976 . writer/director richard linklater's first feature was slacker , a quirky but gimmicky look at apathetic twenty-somethings that established his talent for creating unique and amusing characters . while many of the characters are recognizable high school types , what i found original was that these were types i actually recognized from high school , not from * movies * about high school . cool but basically decent randy interacts convincingly with both his jock buddies and the inexperienced mitch . linklater gives them sparkling dialogue , daring to let his characters talk like teenagers actually talk . the one major character failing in dazed is the absence of any equally interesting female characters ; many could be interchangeable . this is a male coming-of-age film first and foremost , but it could have been more inclusive . as a film without a real plot , dazed depends on set pieces and atmosphere . the hazing of the junior high girls is lively , as is a wacky monologue by the stoned slater about george and martha washington's fondness for marijuana . however , there's a fair amount of dead space , and it's left to the cast of unknowns to fill it . they are generally personable enough to do so , particularly wiggins and cochrane , but not always . as for atmosphere , it's dead on . dazed captures 1976 brilliantly , from the bell bottoms and feathered hair to the soundtrack of early hard rock classics to a pair of statues painted to look like members of kiss . the production design had to be perfect , and it is . anyone who can't quite recall a time when sex was safe and far fewer kids "" just said no "" should take a look just for the sake of historical accuracy . it's impossible for me to determine whether those not in my age bracket will be as enamored of dazed and confused as i was . it's a slight , loopy little film with no pretensions , and it was a page right out of my own youth . i don't know . . . maybe you had to be there . of course , * i * didn't inhale .

"first of all , let's get the obvious question out of the way . however , while moore's body may be the movie's primary selling point , the film tries to do more than just display naked breasts . the heart of striptease is a satirical examination of those who frequent strip clubs , and this makes it profoundly different from showgirls , which embraced those aspects of american culture that striptease lampoons . unfortunately , striptease's satirical bent , while aimed not only at the sexist attitudes of those who patronize topless joints , but at politicians , right-wing religious fanatics , and lawyers , is unfocused and lacks the requisite viciousness . it's just one aspect of a muddled , overly-long motion picture that can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama . ultimately , the overabundance of ineffective dramatic moments hurts the movie . the situation is just too improbable and silly to carry any dramatic weight . one of the supposed comic elements of striptease is burt reynolds' offensive , fatuous character . this is an unsavory man , and reynolds plays him in a creepy , unsettling manner . but , if it's difficult to laugh at reynolds , the same can't be said about ving rhames . in his role as shad , the eager beaver's bouncer , rhames' deadpan , matter-of-fact style ( similar to the one he used in pulp fiction ) is consistently hilarious . moore is fine in this role , although more attention will be paid to her physical attributes than her acting . she's a little out of her depth in the dramatic sequences , although that's only one of the reasons they don't work ( the script being the primary culprit ) . young rumer willis , who received a lot of notoriety before she was born as a result of moore's vanity fair cover , displays some promise with her unaffected performance . despite being designed to mock those who leer , striptease does some leering of its own . several lengthy topless dance sequences are shot in an energetic and provocative manner . it's easy to be cynical about this film's motives , especially considering how drastically andrew bergman's script has watered down the most biting aspects of carl hiaasen's novel . striptease is a curious mix of eroticism , comedy , and drama that , instead of blending into a pleasing whole , has a tendency to separate and curdle .

' robin williams -- who else ? -- does a nice turn as the humorous dr . know , a franchised , electronic knowledge dispenser , to whom david turns for advice . john williams's music with its creepy undercurrents reminds us to always be on our guard . filmed in a beautiful haze by janusz kaminski ( shindler's list ) , the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat as you are sweep into its mysteries and its characters . after reaching an absolutely perfect concluding spot , the last act tacks on a long feel good ending that is more likely to infuriate than to please . the result is less than a masterpiece but much , much more than the typical movie fare . and it is , thankfully , a summer movie with something on its mind . a . i . artificial intelligence runs 2 : 20 . it is rated pg-13 for some sexual content and violent images and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up . my son jeffrey , age 12 , gave it * * 1/2 . he thought it was interesting and had impressive images . he was troubled by what he thought were many logical holes . he also complained that it ended at the wrong place , saying , `not all fairy tales have to end perfectly in happy endings .

"vivica a . fox , who has had the bad luck to be in some pretty miserable movies , including idle hands and booty call , as well as an occasional winner like independence day , plays shante with a wonderfully compelling mixture of comedic verve and rock solid self-assurance . shante spends most of the time talking directly to us to explain her program , which she does with a winning smile that's hard to resist . shante allows as how ,  every gal's got a little 'ho in her ,  but shante thinks that there's too much of it in conny . even if writer/director mark brown's two can play that game is rather like a sitcom , it is like a really good sitcom . the characters are all so likeable that you feel sorry to see them leave when the ending credits roll . one of the movie's small jokes is the flagrant product placements , which could be considered the sitcom's commercial breaks . the movie's look , however , from the lush cinematography to the colorful clothing is head and shoulders above anything you would expect to find on television . although this is fox's film , the rest of the cast is superb .  it is merely transferred from one person to the next .  all keith needs to do is to learn how to properly channel shante's energy , and shante has enough energy to power a small nuclear reactor . you'll be pretty charged up too after watching two can play that game . it is an upbeat film with a wonderfully sweet sense of humor . it is rated r for  language including sexual dialogue ,  and would be acceptable for most teenagers . just send me a letter with the word  subscribe  in the subject line .

"if i were in a kind mood , i might say that the specialist attempts to be an atmospheric , dramatic thriller . on the other hand , if i wanted to be truthful , i could note that this film has two obvious assets ( both of which are used to maximum advantage ) : sylvester stallone's biceps and sharon stone's breasts . everything else , ultimately , is superfluous , as becomes apparent the moment you actually start to think about the story line . may , however , is not entirely on the level . this movie is excruciatingly dumb . and , given the releases of speed and blown away this summer , there's no dearth of explosion-based motion pictures . the atmosphere of the specialist is peculiar . it's almost gothic in nature , with dark settings , dim lighting , and a grandiose john barry score ( which might have been impressive somewhere else ) . the cinematographer clearly has a sense of style far in excess of what's warranted for this movie . several scenes take place in misty surroundings , and the overall mood is relentlessly grim . no one appears to be having fun , least of all the actors . to say that woods goes over-the-top would be to vastly understate what he accomplishes in this  performance .  his acting is as far overboard as the director allows , and that's quite a distance . this sort of manic display is actually entertaining to watch , primarily because everything else offered by the specialist is so bland and dreary . it's always a bad sign when the most impressive feature of a motion picture is its visual effects . in this case , the memorable moments ( if you ignore a scene where woods literally foams at the mouth ) occur when buildings blow up . unfortunately , they don't take up much screen time , and to get from one to another , you have to endure the so-called plot that moves events along . no amount of pyrotechnics , bare flesh , and flexing muscles is worth that price .

"don't make the mistake of assuming that  187  is gritty , urban classroom drama in the mold of dangerous minds . but this story isn't about the amazing power of dedicated teachers to effect change in the face of socio-economic hardships and an oppressive tie-in soundtrack .  187  is a horror movie . at least that's what it _should_ have been . for most of the time he is on the screen , jackson generates a tension which threatens to explode at any moment . his performance is raw and haunting , like a priest experiencing a crisis of faith . credit jackson with an insight screenwriter scott yagemann and director kevin reynolds both lack . yagemann's script -- full to bursting with good teachers ( kelly rowan ) and bad teachers ( john heard ) , good students ( karina arroyave ) and bad students -- fairly yanks the outrage out of us with pliers , dwelling on the unconscionable conditions and trite confrontations . reynolds , meanwhile , perhaps in an attempt to create an atmosphere of surreality , opens up the film school grab-bag -- dizzying 360 degree tracking shots , blurred focus , black-and-white video footage , jittery hand-held camera work , slow motion , rust-tinged cinematography . it is a dreadfully misguided choice . every flashy gimmick proves distancing and distracting , pulling us away from the painful reality of garfield's life . it's clear that the makers of  187  want to leave viewers angry and frustrated . and they succeed , though not in the way they intended . we don't need another film to drag us into the classroom to show us how bad things are . we don't need another film to lecture to us , or to try to impress us with cinematic puffery . only in a riveting climax do we ever get a chance to see garfield in his darkest moments , as reynolds and yagemann create a pointless did-he-or-didn't-he mystery . this could have been the urban high school film which has been begging to be made for years , one which avoids inanely and simplistically describing that world as  gritty  or  tough .  the appropriate word is  terrifying .  the appropriate mood is horror . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line  subscribe  .

"frears himself supplied the answer by saying that as uneasy as he felt about the decision , the opportunity to film roddy doyle's wonderful script was more than enough to overcome any misgivings . the result speaks for itself . in the curley household , unwed motherhood isn't the disaster it might be elsewhere . the snapper is a very funny production , and it gets funnier as the movie progresses . some of the humor is distinctly irish in flavor , and it takes a while to get used to the ebb and flow of certain jokes . the biggest obstacle to laughter in the snapper may be getting past the heavy irish accents . wisely , however , miramax has decided against subtitles , which would have ruined the subtlety of many of the wittier moments . rarely has a movie honestly , yet humorously , shown how the pressures of pregnancy can tear at the fabric of a close-knit , working-class family . the relationship between sharon and her dad is more intimate than that of most daughter/father pairings , and the things that these two have to admit to one another are often heartrendingly difficult to say . in fact , it may ultimately be some of the dramatic elements of the snapper that hold the humor in check . it's hard to let loose with unrestrained laughter when you recognize the pain that underlies a scene . there are several sequences that move from laughter to tears back to laughter , bringing the audience along on the roller coaster ride . this structure doesn't always work , and that occasionally leads to an unsettled feeling . this role could easily have turned into a type , but colm meaney's intelligent portrayal makes desi seem more like a real person than a writer's creation . the actress has a highly-expressive face which director frears knows how to exploit , and this is used to her advantage . many times sharon doesn't have to speak for us to know exactly what she's feeling . also impressive is fionnuala murphy as sharon's best friend jackie . the best thing about the snapper is that it manages drama without manipulation . every emotion generated is legitimate . the script is honest and takes chances , not all of which work , but one thing it never does is set the audience up . it's refreshing to see an old subject dealt with in the refreshing and original manner that the snapper handles pregnancy . the marriage of humor and drama is admittedly imperfect , but it works well enough to occasionally spawn laughter and touch the heart , and there's a crucial scene between colm meaney and tina kellegher that is beautifully written , acted , and directed . i'm sure there's much more in this movie for a native of ireland than for a  foreigner ,  but the film contains moments of universal appeal . even those who have trouble understanding the accents will find that once the language barrier is broken and the slang deciphered , the snapper has a surprising amount of depth .

"this is a ridiculous film . if you think about it , it just doesn't make sense . it's a tale about wishy-washy  humanitarianism .  that is something i just find hard to believe always happens ( opinions often change , but people ( principles ) do not ) . it's a manipulative film and if you go with the flow of the story and accept the logic presented , then everything is manufactured to make you eschew reason and be persuaded by your blind emotional responses . this is a middle-brow art film and even though it pretends to offer more , it doesn't . it should only serve those who go to films to be entertained in the way a vacuous hollywood film does , where the viewer is expected not to care how ridiculous the story is . what this film is best at doing , is having its star actors look good and have a cinematographer , like eduardo sarra ( leconte himself did a lot of the filming ) , make a static film look stimulating by beautifully photographing it . these are diversionary tactics that can easily lull one into just going into a slumber and accepting this contrived film at face value without giving it a further thought . patrice leconte (  ridicule  ) latest film  the widow of st . pierre  is particularly annoying because it is so smug . it is a film that stacks the deck in the murderer's favor and could care less about the murder victim . if the film's aim is to make a case against capital punishment , it succeeds only in making a case for phony compassion . i'm afraid the filmmaker's aims are just to make a movie pushing its star cast into appealing fantasy roles and sucking the viewer into believing the film is serious in tackling tough issues because the stars are taking their roles in a serious manner . its moral high ground against capital punishment was not only unconvincing , but it leaves a bitter feeling in the air . do-gooders generally manage to do more harm than good , and that will prove itself in this film as well . the widow of saint-pierre is juliette binoche ( in my book , she's the julia roberts of french movies , matching the american in superficial acting techniques ) . it might be of interest to note , that guillotine is a slang word for  widow  in french . basically , this is a bourgeois story about the self-righteous couple wallowing in their comfort and materialism and self-aggrandizing powers . his blank look at his situation is probably what the director expects from his ideal movie viewer . this is a visually pleasing film ; it has nothing more to offer than a make believe tale about real issues and concerns that the film can't get to because of its own arrogance in filmmaking .

"screenplay : kevin smith . director : kevin smith . kevin smith's dogma is offensive . devotees of film industry scuttlebutt probably know that miramax , dogma's original distributor , put the film on the auction block after religious groups started turning up the heat . catholic organizations in particular declaimed the film's subject matter , many proclaiming it sacrilegious sight unseen (  i don't need to swim in a sewer to know it stinks ,  went one typical slice of logic ) . it won't surprise any of those folks when i say dogma is offensive . and i'm not even talking about the theological content . dogma should be offensive to anyone who expects more from a movie than two hours of a filmmaker's musings on every religious notion that ever came into his head . those musings are linked -- rather tenuously -- to a plot involving the very fate of existence itself . and oh boy , are there plenty of lengthy conversations . smith's eternity-threatening premise is probably meant to distract from an otherwise non-stop series of metaphysical/scriptural/doctrinal discussions on everything from the nature of god to religious intolerance . it doesn't . dogma is an incredibly long sit , a deep-n-profound dorm room debate of a movie without the benefit of cold pizza and beer . sometimes smith is simply snarky ( a deconstruction of  the walrus and the carpenter  as a critique of organized religion ) , in which cases he often churns out genuine laughs . when smith actually does get into the events of his plot , things don't get much better . smith has always been a filmmaker only in the most nominal sense , but his limitations are even more evident when he makes a half-hearted effort to add supernatural action to the mix ( radically shifting the tone from comedy to grim violence along the way ) . in a way , the low-tech fight sequences have their charms ; battles always seem to occur just outside the frame , and people come flying through the air from improbable directions . it's hard to cut smith that much slack , though , because you can't help but think his choices are based entirely on his limited visual vocabulary . he'll point a camera at people sitting around a table as long as you'll let him . i suppose the most frustrating thing about dogma is that , whatever your feelings about its messages , kevin smith is the wrong messenger . it's not that his insights aren't insightful -- he has some interesting things to say about faith , religions and self-righteousness -- but that he's pitching his weighty notions in such a scattershot fashion . life of brian could get away with borderine sacrilege because monty python played it smart and scathing ; dogma may be a sincere expression of belief , but it's too juvenile too often . smith opens the film with a disclaimer that the film is only meant to be a satire , then includes a comment to the effect that  god must have a sense of humor . . . you simply _must_ do better than that if you want to turn sacred cows into fajitas . i hope smith feels better about religion after venting his spleen into a feature film . losing two hours to deep thoughts wrapped in limp jokes -- now _that_ i find offensive . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject  subscribe  .

"director : kinka usher . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , mild profanity , adult humor ) running time : 117 minutes . of all the reasons to be frustrated by a film , i'll take the one mystery men provides : it's just too clever and original for its own damned good . the super-hero action film has become such a predictable package of action sequences , limp quips and bland characterizations that it was screaming for a satirical treament . to fill this need , along comes mystery men , spinning out a dozen different ways to turn the genre on its ear . . . which turns out to be at least a half-dozen too many . as busily directed by television commercial auteur kinka usher , mystery men rarely sits still long enough for any one of its sharp ideas to turn into inspired comedy . the concept , based on characters appearing in dark horse comics , offers plenty of potential . mystery men works best from the outset by turning its super-heroes into analogs for contemporary athletes . every so often , mystery men nails the absurdity of its premise so well that the comedy is blissfully perfect . it's just not often enough . as the film winds its way through two hours , its comic highlights are nearly matched by the unexplored sub-plots . lost in the shuffle of too many characters are the team's two over-eager tag-alongs , the geeky spleen and earnest invisible boy ( whose  powers  may be nothing more than a major case of teenage existential angst ) . neil cuthbert's script spends too much time on the sphinx's initially amusing yoda-like training , and too little on kinnear's splendidly smug captain amazing . rush's cassanova frankenstein hardly gets a moment to develop a distinct personality , treating his teutonic accent as sufficient evidence of his villainy . mystery men wants to make every possible gag about super-heroes in one film , but it's off on the next set-up before you get a chance to appreciate the last punch line . thankfully , there are just enough quirky pleasures in mystery men to counteract its hyperactivity . a cast like stiller , garofalo , macy and azaria guarantees more oddball enjoyment than most films could deliver , but they could have been part of a cult classic . it's ironic that a parody of summer movie overkill is guilty of some of the same sins . you can't swing for the fences every time , especially if you're a minor leaguer trying to make it to  the show .  sometimes , you've gotta take one for the team . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject  subscribe  .

"anyone following the behind-the-scenes history of even cowgirls get the blues knew that the film was in trouble long before its release . it didn't work . even cowgirls is as close to an unwatchable film as there is available at this time in the theaters . perhaps i might be more sympathetic had i read tom robbins' 1976 book - the  first hippie novel  , as van sant calls it - but i haven't , so i'll leave the comparisons to someone else . whether or not this is the 90s version of bonfire of the vanities remains to be seen , although cinematically , it's certainly on the same level . this provokes an armed federal response , and one of the most laughably idiotic denouements in recent film history . even if the plot made sense ( which it really doesn't ) and wasn't unbelievably contrived ( which it is ) , even cowgirls is difficult to follow because of its disjointed nature . whether this is a result of poor editing , confused writing , or ( most likely ) a combination of the two , the result is obvious - a chaotic motion picture that never finds its focus and is agonizing to sit through . sissy , the main character , is bland , although through no fault of uma thurman , whose performance is reasonably restrained in the midst of a festival of scenery-chomping . the problem with sissy is that van sant never forges a connection between her and the audience . there is no emotional link , and the viewer isn't likely to care any more about her at the end than at the beginning . with the notable exception of that given by thurman , the performances are awful . lorraine bracco ( who i don't consider to be a good actor ) and john hurt ( who i do ) go so far over the top that you wonder if they'll ever reach bottom . the dialogue , especially the tom robbins-supplied voiceovers , is grating . there's too much pretension and posturing here , and a typical conversation consists of characters trying to one-up each other in the number of meaningless profundities they can spew out . this is probably supposed to make the viewer ponder ; amidst all the other garbage that comprises even cowgirls , it just made me reel . the themes presented by the movie - feminism and the rights of the individual - have a heavy 70s flavor that van sant has done nothing to update . in a rare case of getting something right , at least even cowgirls gives a natural , non-exploitative view of lesbian love . then there are sissy's thumbs . every time sissy sticks out these monstrosities to hitch a ride , the viewer's eyes are glued to them - not because of some inner desire to gape at the deformity , but because they look so fake . further rumination on even cowgirls is probably as pointless as the film itself . the only possible reason to see it is to experience firsthand how badly a moderately-budgeted art film can go wrong . in some sense , it's hard to believe that this much talent can produce something so worthless . that's enough to give anyone the blues .

"not knowing much about the life of dorothy day , i approached this bio-pic with interest . unfortunately , two hours later , while i knew quite a bit more about the woman's life , i felt like i'd been subjected to a dry , unremarkable , text-book retelling of her accomplishments . entertaining angels has a shallow , tv movie style that reduces what could have been compelling drama to a sadly superficial experience . unfortunately , john wells' script lets her down . no matter how hard she tries , she can't overcome the constraints placed on her by a pedestrian screenplay and a director who isn't willing to try anything ambitious . with the exception of brief , bookending scenes that take place in the 1960s , entertaining angels proceeds in a strictly chronological fashion , starting in 1917 and concluding around 1938 . entertaining angels was produced by paulist pictures , the catholic organization that formerly made romero . occasional forays into overt moralizing betray the film's origins . it's an embarrassing scene that should have been excised from the final print . melodramatic and poorly-written , it serves only to remind us that , although even the most devout christians occasionally doubt their faith ,  the lord will provide .  it can rightfully be claimed that viewing someone's actions tells us a lot about the person . in that sense , entertaining angels gives a reasonable portrait of its subject . ultimately , however , too much is skimmed over or completely ignored by this film . entertaining angels is interested exclusively in mundane plot exposition , and , while that functions adequately in giving a loose sense of day's importance in history , it fails to provide us with a rounded view of the woman who bears the famous name . because of its limited , constricted view , entertaining angels is less satisfying than it should be . -- ingmar bergman ",2,0.0129499075464,3.475223532289999e-61,0.987050092454
"groovy platform shoes and bell-bottoms , happening floral prints , far out leisure suits , and a dreamy davey jones -- once again , we've been sent time tripping with the bradys , the stuck-in-the-'70s clan living in the '90s . with the premise firmly established in last year's the brady bunch movie , a very brady sequel offers more of the same : sexual innuendo , double entendres , and a truckload of references to the original series . aficionados of the tv show will probably appreciate this film , as will those who enjoyed the first installment . after all , there's nothing new here -- this is just a continuation of the jokes and style that made the initial big-screen foray a surprise success . even though the director has changed ( arlene sanford replacing betty thomas ) , the two movies fit together so well that it's impossible to notice . a very brady sequel lacks the freshness of the first outing , but it makes up for it -- at least as much as it can -- with a slightly better plot structure . nevertheless , there's only so far you can stretch an affectionate parody of the bradys , and , like its predecessor , this film loses its momentum before the halfway mark . by the end , all the puns ,  innocent  sex jokes , and nods to the series have become tiresome . the scenes of the bradys blithely interacting with '90s culture don't have nearly the bite they should -- things are played a little too nice , a little too safe . the material in the brady bunch movie couldn't sustain a ninety-minute feature , and neither can that in a very brady sequel . as was true of the 1995 film , the most remarkable aspect of the production is how it mimics the feel of the series . the sets are near- perfect recreations , and the performers look and act eerily like their tv predecessors . unlike in the brady bunch movie , there aren't any cameos by former cast members , but a couple of witty links to other old tv shows ( gilligan's island and i dream of jeannie in particular ) make up for it . a very brady sequel has a light , breezy air that will probably appeal to a certain segment of the movie-going population , although it's a little too vacuous for my taste . at half its length , a very brady sequel would have been fun , but , no incarnation of the brady bunch , no matter how cleverly satirized , can use up an hour and a half's screen time without making the audience feel like they've overdosed .

"perhaps you have the same reaction to documentaries that i do . in general , they aren't my favorite type of movie , and it's usually only with a degree of reluctance that i see even a highly praised member of the genre . despite my misgivings , however , i almost always come away educated and intrigued , provided , of course , that the film maker has a clear idea of what he or she is doing . and , in the case of errol morris , the man who made one of the best-ever documentaries ( the thin blue line ) , the strength of presentation couldn't be more apparent . fast , cheap & out of control isn't much like any of morris' other well-known films -- gates of heaven ( about a pet cemetery ) , the thin blue line ( about a murder ) , and a brief history of time ( about science , space , and infinity ) . in fact , at first glance , this movie appears startlingly unambitious by comparison -- the kind of project one might encounter any night on pbs or the discovery channel . but there's more to fast , cheap & out of control than initially meets the eye . not only is there a great deal of craft involved in the film's production , but its underlying themes are compelling and universal . the basic framework for fast , cheap & out of control has morris interviewing four men with unique , but not terribly interesting , professions . all four of these individuals are among the best in their respective fields , and it's their passion for their jobs , rather than anything especially startling or hypnotic about the work itself , that piques our interest . as we watch , however , we become aware that , by structuring fast , cheap & out of control as he does , morris is doing far more than merely presenting a series of talking-head interviews . by piecing the film together with fast cuts and sequences where the soundtrack of one interview overlaps images depicting the activities of another of the subjects , morris explores at least two intriguing , interrelated themes : the evolution of humankind and our never-ending attempt to control our environment . contrast is a critical element . shaped by an ever-changing cultural and technical climate , jobs , like people , evolve . by telling all four stories , morris gives us a sense of what will be lost and what may be gained as time moves on . fast , cheap & out of control functions as a requiem for the past and a nod to the future . and even the mild-mannered mendonca alters the course of nature by twisting and shaping bushes into works of art . still , if you're a reluctant documentary-goer like me , there's probably only one question that you want answered : what's so special about a movie than interviews a no-name lion tamer , a no-name hedge trimmer , a no-name vermin photographer ( with a funny bow-tie ) , and a no- name robot scientist ? the answer , simply and succinctly , is errol morris , who has the talent to give meaning to even the most apparently- mundane material . spending time with the four subjects of fast , cheap & out of control isn't just an opportunity to learn about what they do , but , surprisingly , a chance to understand a little more about our place in the universe .  the cinema is not an art which films life : the cinema is something between art and life . unlike painting and literature , the cinema both gives to life and takes from it . . .  - jean-luc godard ",1,0.0,0.9998345637039999,0.00016543629571899997

"as i reported recently , hollywood is on a shakespeare tear . the studios just released three shakespearean films and have more about to be unveiled . this week i got to see for the first time the laurence olivier classic richard iii from 1956 . this is one of three shakespearean films where olivier was both director and star . in hamlet he actually won the award as well as garnered a nomination for best director . when i saw the film , the theater was rather full . since the sign on the door incorrectly said looking for richard , perhaps there were even a few people there wondering when al pacino would show up on screen . the audience's reaction was fascinating . the teenagers saw the costumes and the exaggerated acting style and laughed frequently at the film . to them the movie was a parody . otto heller's old saturated technicolor print and roger k . furse's disneyland style sets combined to look like the wizard of oz . actually , it visually reminded me of the 5 , 000 fingers of dr . moreover , olivier's elaborate costumes , bad hairdo , and fake nose kept me thinking how much olivier looked liked hans conried playing dr . terwilliker . most of the rest of the audience seemed to have my reaction , an interesting film , but not quite what i had expected . it certainly does not possess the seriousness of his henry v . the film opens with a hokey score by william walton . like most of the film , although it seems so dated today , it probably seemed fresh and stirring in its time . the sets have a fairy tale quality , and the whole movie , with the exception of the ending , has the claustrophobic feeling of a filmed play . today's shakespearean interpreters , especially branagh and zeffirelli , open up the plays much more when they bring them to the screen . in olivier's days , most of the movies were filmed in the controlled environments of the studios' sound stages . another difference is in the way shakespeare's text is adapted . most modern screenwriters , most especially baz luhrmann with his screenplay this year for romeo and juliet , truncate long monologues . alan dent and laurence olivier's script for this richard iii edit only slightly the long monologues and have them delivered in sparsely furnished rooms so that the viewer has few distractions . here i must be honest , as much as i admired olivier's richard iii , i found mckellen's more involving . olivier's film is interesting and certainly the acting is excellent , but i had trouble getting over how dated it all seemed . don't get me wrong , i do like old movies and think olivier's henry v is brilliant . it is at this point that the movie really came alive for me . one never knows of course what the original prints looked like . olivier's richard iii is less serious and more colorful than i had expected , but it is a film well worth seeing . i do not feel i can close without listing some of the many members of the cast . richard iii ran 2 : 19 in the version i saw , but some footage has been lost over the years . originally it ran about 2 : 40 . the film is not rated but would get a g today . there is no sex , nudity , or bad language . the little violence is cartoonish , but there is a little blood . the film would be fine for a child of any age , but young children can only appreciate the visuals since the language is way too obscure for them . i recommend the film to you and give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"8 heads in a duffel bag definitely isn't for everyone . but if you have a twisted sense of humor and can see the comedy in films like weekend at bernie's , this movie is right up your alley . for my part , while i wasn't overly impressed by significant chunks of the movie , there were times when i was nearly doubled over with laughter . 8 heads in a duffel bag works very much like a series of skits cobbled together into a movie -- some of them work , some don't . not surprisingly , the most interesting performer in the film is lead actor joe pesci . in the midst of all the madcap zaniness , pesci plays his role mostly straight -- a weary hitman who just wants to complete one last job so he can retire . some of 8 heads' best moments come as a result of pesci's even-handed approach to the material . in fact , the movie's comic momentum has a tendency to flag whenever he's off-screen for more than a few minutes . tommy's trouble starts on the airplane , when he's forced to check his bag because it's too large to be carried on . a lot of the humor in 8 heads is expectedly lowbrow and grotesque , but there are some truly inspired moments . writer/first-time director tom schulman ( who , curiously enough , penned dead poets' society ) clearly knows how to use macabre circumstances to get a laugh , although by the last reel he has become repetitive . while this is ultimately pesci's film , there is a fairly sizable supporting cast . newcomer andy comeau does a nice job making charlie seem both likable and inept . george hamilton , dyan cannon , and kristy swanson all have their moments , but , in general , their work here is largely forgettable . while louiso's interaction with the heads is worth at least a chuckle , spade is constantly more annoying than funny . 8 heads in a duffel bag offers humor of the most irreverent , and sometimes downright disgusting , sort . as a result , it belongs in the same group as films like the monster and cemetery man , neither of which could be described as examples of sophisticated taste . and , while this particular entry is not really a  good  film in the traditional sense , it's hard to make it all the way through without laughing your head off at least once .

"of all the reasons i was pleasantly surprised by good will hunting -- and there were several -- the easiest to identify was its subversive awareness of its own genre . i called long ago for a moratorium on physician-heal-thyself psychiatrists as a cinematic type ; therapy sessions as revelatory contrivance seemed just as ready for mothballs . good will hunting can't possibly steer clear of every pitfall associated with therapy-centered drama , but it's conscious enough of those pitfalls to provide a goofy sense of originality . the script , by damon and his co-star and real-life buddy affleck , keeps the dialogue between will and sean generally smart and smart-alecky ( particularly sharp was a pastoral scene which will describes as a  taster's choice moment between the guys  ) . the arc of their relationship is convincing and patiently developed , with williams and damon sharing an impressive chemistry . the performances are consistently strong enough ( even robin williams in his  bearded , ergo serious  mode ) to carry good will hunting through its inevitable dips into confrontation , as well as a running time which could have used a judicious twenty minutes of trimming . strongest of all is damon himself in a dazzlingly charismatic piece of screen acting . both believably brilliant and convincingly rough around the edges , damon avoids the too-common actor's trap of white-washing his character's dark side . it's too conventional an instinct for a director who has rarely done anything the conventional way , offering damon a protection he simply doesn't need . as both actor and writer , matt damon gives good will hunting energy , soul and a welcome desire to avoid trite situations . it's a rare drama which satisfies without pandering , a feel-good , heal-good session which gives you just a little hope that every trip to the couch doesn't have to be a trip into cliche-land . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line  subscribe  .

"director chris columbus's stepmom , which would have more appropriately been titled mommy's dying , wants to be two movies . as seen in the film's light-hearted trailers , stepmom wants to be a comedic look at the perils of being a stepmother , and , indeed , the movie's first act sticks to that plan . rather than examining the relatively unexplored territory of stepmothering , the movie wants , most of all , to be another terminal illness picture , of which we have one a month . the maudlin script , by a committee of no less than 5 writers , expects you to bring extra tissues and use every one of them . in a stellar performance , susan sarandon plays jackie , the obsessively prepared and sanctimonious mother . the treacly script has a throwaway and not credible subplot about her being fired for trying to mix a career with parenting .  mommy , if you want me to hate her i will ,  he tells jackie with a sincere innocence . well , duh ! the film is at its best when it tries to grapple with the issues and conflicts surrounding divorce and remarriage .  can i move out ?  the by-the-numbers plot has isabel taking the kids to central park while she conducts a photo shoot . - gets lost , which makes isabel feel very bad about not being a dutiful parent like jackie . and jackie gets to rant and rave and generally feel superior . try as hard as they can , the superlative acting by sarandon and roberts can not overcome the schmaltzy material . manipulative to the end , the movie prolongs jackie's dying as long as possible . it wants to wring every last tear possible out of the audience . stepmom runs too long at 2 : 04 . it is rated pg-13 for profanity , thematic elements and dope smoking and would be fine for teenagers .

"it is an extremely moving tale that points to the ultimate hopelessness of the human condition . the script by claude berri and arlette langmann and the direction by claude berri pull no punches . this is a movie that rarely considers the gray areas , but paints everything in sharp contrasts . everything is either good or evil ; there is no middle ground . periodically , we glimpse the possibility of a few redeeming features in the rich , but generally they are portrayed as the devil incarnate . although the number of contrasts the film metaphorically presents seem innumerable , the ones that struck me the most were : rich vs . poor , day vs . night , above ground vs . under ground , light vs . dark , opulence vs . frugality , green vs . brown , workers vs . bosses , and capitalism vs . unionism . if you watch for them , you can see many more , and this contrast provides an extremely effective and propagandistic albeit one sided reading of history . the other , an anarchist i guess , says the only solution is to burn down all of the mines and factories and only out of this utter destruction will salvation arise . what a great bunch of choices zola provides ! we can change this lousy world .  within a week you'll all starve . then what will you do ?  the smallest increase will bankrupt me .  the second part of the film deals with the chaos that ensues once a massive strike is underway . the film ends well , but it is both dramatic and frightening . the acting is brilliant all round . there are many scenes where their acting is right on the edge . the supporting cast is also good , except for the bosses , but then again , they are made to seem so shallow that it would be hard for an actor to shine playing one of them . the cinematography by yves angelo is somber and striking , full of brown and black sepia tones . the sets by thanh at hoang and christian marti are evocative of great horror and misery . the most frightening scenes are those of the claustrophobic sets for the mines . the make-up by joel lavau and nathalie louichon provide just the right feel of the grit on a coal miner's face . germinal runs too long at 2 : 50 , and i would have preferred editor herve de luze to have made the movie not such an epic length . the film is rated r for sex , nudity , and violence . most of the film has little violence , but there are a few needlessly horrific scenes , including one of castration , that should have been edited out . nevertheless , it is my judgment that the movie would be fine for most teenagers . i liked the movie , recommend it to you , and award it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"the title comes from the markings found on packages delivered by the postal service . the inspiration of the film comes from the studio-like hollywood musicals of the '50s . his other influences are the great french directors of the past , such as renoir and vigo . i rented up down fragile , along with rivette's first feature , paris belongs to us ( 1960 ) , and it was interesting to see how rivette kept some of the same themes , how one has the need to be alone and also the need to be with a group , how one handles reality and fantasy , and the politics of being . in his newer film , which was stylistically and cinematically a much more sophisticated and well-done production than the former , we see these themes come out clearer , brought out by a director who is more assured of his abilities to work with actors on a more experimental basis , as they each collaborate on the script , as he gets them to improvise in their roles . the film follows the life of its three main characters : ninon ( natashe ) , louise ( marianne ) , and ida ( laurence ) , as they try to work out their many problems in life , occasionally breaking out in song and dance at the oddest moments , even when the film is moving along in a dramatic fashion . this lighthearted approach to the film annoyed me on my first viewing , but when i watched the film for a second time , i felt more relaxed and was able to get in the mood rivette probably intended for his film to be viewed ; which is , that it is up to me to fill in the meaning of the story . but , this also , allowed me not to take this film as a very serious work but more or less as a spectacle in the hollywood tradition , a tradition that rivette gladly acknowledges a kinship and admiration for . its entertainment value was enhanced by the gorgeous use of colors , which captured the summertime paris streets and parks , as well as the beautful indoor sets . we followed the moped messenger , ex-whore , ninon , do her deliveries . that this musical is better than most of the hollywood musicals it flatteringly immitates , is true to a certain extent . it is better in the sense , that rivette is able to bring out the poetry of the real-life situations and present his existential view of life and not just play for the song and dance to be the thing . though the hollywood performers are more professional and have better voices and quicker feet , is certainly true , but they also , seem to rely on an artificial story . while for rivette , as amateur as his performers might seem to be in comparison , the story still seems real and important , and the musical numbers are intrusive but seem to be imbued with a magical quality about them , that makes them seem just as fantasy oriented as the typical hollywood production ; and , in my opinion , that makes for a more interesting and better film . though it makes for a different way for american audiences to appreciate the musical , a form of film that hollywood at one time was the most innovative creators of , but has now all but abandoned that genre because of high production costs and not enough box office gross to show for its efforts .

"producers : clint eastwood , karen spiegel . director : clint eastwood . when we first encounter luther whitney ( clint eastwood ) in absolute power , he is sitting in an art gallery sketching hands and eyes from paintings in one of those slow , silent moments characteristic of an eastwood-directed film . at that moment , you may be tempted to break into a slight smile , impressed that eastwood has merely fleshed out his character under the guise of plot development . perhaps , you think , this won't be just another plot-driven conspiracy thriller . perhaps three-dimensional characters are going to make it something special . just wait sixty seconds . luther manages to escape , but the president's people know there was a witness . almost any other director would have taken this material and made it a big , dumb hollywood thriller -- and frankly , that probably would have been the best thing for it . eastwood is a director with a precise control over the details of his films , but in absolute power he spends so much time fussing over those details that he fails to notice that the story is completely absurd . while eastwood is able to construct clockwork sequences like an ambush at a coffee shop , he doesn't seem to care that , like much of what goes on in absolute power , it is resolved through pure coincidence . even the casting manages to get in the way , specifically the casting of hackman as richmond . the press notes for absolute power boast of hackman's career that  there is no such thing as a 'gene hackman role , '  but that simply isn't true . it is also hard to figure out how the pathetic , libidinous drunkard of that opening scene becomes the take-charge whip-cracker , or why his press conference in support of his grieving friend sullivan demonstrates such a lousy poker face you wonder what kind of politician this guy could possibly be . the script , by the legendary william goldman , does offer a few nice touches and typically snappy dialogue , and ed harris plays the detective investigating the murder as a courtly and respectful spin on the usual foul-mouthed cop . when a central character seems to be a different person from scene to scene , however , those little details lose a lot of their charm . that brings us to eastwood's luther whitney , as baffling a screen character as i can recall . eastwood's acting has grown more interesting with the passing years , more relaxed and subtle , but he has devoted nearly every ounce of energy in the creation of absolute power to making his own character sympathetic . never mind that before that scene we had no indication that whitney even knew the man in the sullivan house was the president ; in fact , the scene plays funnier and more interesting if whitney is such a recluse that he doesn't even know what the president looks like . but everything is subjugated to giving luther the moral high ground , making him a doting father and a good citizen with a handful of quirky traits . i'm willing to grant the conceit that whitney is a master of disguise even though it doesn't seem particularly necessary for a sneak thief -- maybe he needed a hobby when he tired of sketching the old masters in the smithsonian -- but absolute power lost me when it became clear that this man who could disarm any security system in the world couldn't program a vcr for his alibi .

"the defiant ones received academy awards for sam leavitt's moody cinematography with its sharp whites and gloomy grays and for harold jacob smith and nedrick young's crisp but powerful screenplay . the chase , although interesting , plays out on a minor stage with the dialog within the two groups taking center stage . in contrast to today's films , where the word  nigger  is thrown about as if it means nothing more than any other profanity , this movie treats it with the contempt it deserves . in their first verbal encounter in the picture , joker uses the word nigger to refer to noah . you call me that again , and i'll kill you !  sheriff max muller , played in an oscar nominated performance by theodore bikel , says with disgust ,  the warden's got a sense of humor .  and he's not far off . at this point jail begins to look pretty inviting . kramer stages the scenes with such simplistic power that he gives the outdoors almost the look of a stage play -- all the better to focus the audience's attention on the words in the two dramas at hand . he shoots in tight close-ups to draw the audience into the story . with two superb performances and palpable tension , the film has a strength that rises above the simplicity of the storyline . as siamese twins , for example , their inevitable fistfight makes no sense and yet seems perfectly natural . although some scenes become a bit didactic , most have remarkable subtlety . one brief kiss , and the camera cuts away to the next morning . although i would have preferred a more dramatic and surprising ending , kramer stages the inevitable one with efficient precision , and the story seems to wind down rather than ending . but it is in the dialog that the film finds its power anyway and not the drive toward some hokey conclusion . the defiant ones runs a fast 1 : 37 . it is not rated but would be pg-13 for adult themes and a little violence and would be fine for kids around 10 and up .

"screenplay/director : kevin smith . for the past few years , filmmakers have been trying to capture what it is that defines the generation which has thus far been difficult even to name . so-called  generation x  films like singles ; bodies , rest & motion ; and reality bites have tried , but their target audience seems to have rejected those attempts . at first glance , clerks appears to be cut from the same cloth , a bargain basement variation on tales of cynical , over-qualified and under-achieving whiners . made for a paltry $36 , 000 by writer/director kevin smith , clerks frequently shows its low-budget roots in performances which can charitably be called amateurish . brian o'halloran has an easy-going and engaging presence , but he's often far too broad in his physical acting . only lisa spoonhauer as the sexy and sharp caitlin puts much real spark into her performance . smith's direction is simple , but his insistence on swinging his camera back and forth in two-character scenes also proves distracting . like go fish earlier this year , clerks is occasionally just a bit too clunky to be completely endearing . the episodes which make up clerks are of inconsistent quality , but the good ones are very good . the dialogue is filled with ultra-crude observations which almost earned clerks an nc-17 rating , but they're caustic and on-target . randal in particular , who acts both as the devil on dante's shoulder and as the real voice of reason in clerks , gets some marvelous lines , though virtually every one of them is unprintable . less effective are sequences involving a roller hockey game on the store's roof which simply lasts too long , and a montage of annoying customer types which is a bit is too cutesy . but clerks turns out to be more than just the sum of its parts . kevin smith places himself in the awkward position of chastising those who are most likely to be his audience , and it is that daring that makes clerks most worthy of admiration ; it is not often that personal responsibility is the moral to a story . while he may not have had all the tools at his disposal that a studio filmmaker would have had to tell this story , kevin smith did have a story to tell . clerks is unquestionably uneven , but it is also a very funny wake-up call to the over-the-counter culture .

"a typical 1950s noir , distinguished by its rapid pace and taut script , that delves mainly into the character of the villain-- making him out to be someone who went over-the-edge when he couldn't take being ridiculed as a failure , anymore . by being nearly blind and wearing thick glasses for his myopia , he assumes the role of a victim in society , visually manifesting a pathos based on this physical handicap . this the suburban atmosphere and the no nonsense style of telling the story , are a stark contrast to the suspense building up for the very characteristic 1950s couple . the blandness of the story and the failure to elicit anything out of the ordinary , play against the competence of this well-crafted script . the result is a watchable film , which could be seen for the sense of nostalgia it evokes to a more receptive time for noir to work as well as it does .

"there are two kinds of viewers for the x-files movie : those have seen at least a few episodes of the tv series and those who have never watched it . i am a member of the latter group , so that's the perspective from which this review is written . as a result , i cannot assess how the film will appeal to a die-hard follower of the program . but , for the  uneducated  movie-goer , the x-files offers two hours of solid entertainment . ( of course , one unanswered question is how many non-x files aficionados will exhibit sufficient interest to venture into a theater showing this picture . ) transferring a television program to the big screen has become a routine procedure for a film industry starved for ideas , but this is a rare occasion when the movies continue the adventures begun on the small screen , with no re-casting involved . twentieth century fox is hoping the wrinkle : the television series is still going strong . in interviews , writer/producer/series creator chris carter has stated that his goal with the x-files was to make a movie that could stand on its own . there's no question that he has succeeded . the script can be followed by someone with literally no previous knowledge of the characters or situations . ( by  cleverly ,  i mean that these passages don't cry out ,  character exposition !  ) although i'm told that the storyline picks up where the last season of the tv program left off , there's no sense that new viewers are entering in the middle of things . the only obvious concession to the ongoing series is the ending , which includes several hooks that can be used to launch stories in the upcoming season . mulder and scully have exchanged their investigations of things paranormal and extraterrestrial for more mundane matters such as terrorism . plot-wise , the x-files bears more than a passing resemblance to 1996's alien invasion/conspiracy movie , the arrival . although things get sloppy near the end , when several story holes are ignored or ineffectively plugged , the script as a whole exhibits an uncommon intelligence for this type of movie . in addition , director rob bowman ( who has helmed a number of the tv episodes ) maintains a fairly high level of tension as the complexities of the multi-layered plot mount . the movie is perhaps a little too long ; cutting ten or fifteen minutes would have made for a better focused adventure . it's not hard to understand the appeal of mulder and scully . it also doesn't hurt that they're both likable and neither is hard on the eyes . actors david duchovny ( who's no stranger to movies ; his most recent foray being playing god ) and gillian anderson ( who is more familiar to viewers of the small screen than the large one ) are both accomplished and entirely believable in these roles . of course , we would expect no less of them , since they have been inhabiting these fictitious shells for five years . the chemistry between them is palpable , blending camaraderie and respect with a little subtle romance . having seen the movie , it's easy for me to comprehend why so many people are enamored with the series . although a lot of the material explored in the x-files isn't new or revolutionary , the style of presentation and the quality of the writing set this above most other conspiracy theory/alien invasion pictures . i won't claim that the experience of having watched this film will suddenly convert me into a weekly viewer of the tv show , but at least now i'm aware of what awaits if i choose to catch an episode . in a summer that has been characterized by over-hyped and largely pointless big-budget films , the offerings .  my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down .  -- david puttnam ",1,3.436665163609999e-110,0.998478587906,0.00152141209413
"mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , mild profanity ) . running time : 85 minutes . the strange re-release patterns inspired by chan's sudden american popularity has made it nearly impossible to make any sense of the police story chronology , if making sense of things like this matter to you . first strike itself makes only a rudimentary kind of sense , but chan's hair-raising stunts and affable demeanor rarely require much set-up to be enjoyable . a chase sequence involving gun-toting skiers is straight out of for your eyes only ; the underwater battles in a shark tank with oxygen the most prized possession is vintage thunderball . the scenery shifts from hong kong to the ukraine to australia , serving up a few sacrificial vehicles ( helicopters , a funeral carriage ) for big-time explosions . throw in a saul bass opening credits sequence and a vodka martini and you might think 007 had become a celibate asian . unfortunately , while first strike is the grandest of chan's american releases , it is also the least charming , for most of the same reasons . jackie chan films don't work because of large scale set pieces ; they work because chan himself is extremely personable and because his unmatched fight choreography can make you giddy with pleasure . the moments when chan gets to show his stuff up close are wonderful -- he flips through windows as though he were made of paper , dances across rooftops , uses an inflatable pool toy to walk quite literally on water . the extended sequence where he takes on four men by turning a broom , papier mache dragon heads and an eight foot ladder into weapons is one of the most spectacular hand-to-hand combat sequences i have ever seen on screen , a combination of martial arts and acrobatics edited with astonishing fluidity . while the more elaborate bits fall flat with ho-hum familiarity , the seven minutes of that one fight sequence make first strike worth seeing . the very end of that sequence may be just as indicative of what makes a jackie chan action film unique . as superhuman as chan can be on screen , he is also quite human in his persona . he doesn't endear himself to the audience by tossing off dreary one-liners ; he simply plays a guy , sometimes silly and sometimes embarrassed , who happens to be able to defy gravity . jackie chan's first strike is a terminally dopey spy thriller with anyone else in the lead role . jackie chan alone is enough to make the thought of first strike 2 -- or is that supercop 3 , or police story 5 ? -- somewhat appealing .

"director : mike figgis . late in mike figgis' experimental drama timecode , a young would-be film-maker pitches an idea to a hollywood production company for a film shot on digital video , following four characters in real time in one uninterrupted take . . . at which suggestion one of the production executives bursts into laughter and calls the idea  pretentious .  it seems like figgis is trying to have a little fun at his own expense , since that pitched idea is exactly the idea behind timecode : four characters followed in real time , the screen divided into four quadrants to follow their individual stories . and it would be easier to buy figgis' self-deprecation as genuine if he didn't then begin his closing credits with a caption describing exactly how the film had been made .  look what an interesting and original film you've just watched ,  figgis says to us out of one corner of his mouth , while the other mutters ,  and it was all just a big pretentious joke .  figgis has been on a kick in the last couple of years of trying to stretch cinematic boundaries , but it's too often too difficult to get past his art-for-art's-sake bluster . timecode was essentially improvised around a loose plot structure , leading to a predictably ragged feel to the film . and while figgis would probably emphasize that raggedness as a function of the film's realism and immediacy , it simply doesn't make for particularly engrossing viewing a lot of the time . at times timecode is a satire of film industry poseurs , and occasionally a very funny one . most intrusive of all is the use of a series of earthquakes as a device to shake up the lives of the characters . in a more conventional film , it might have been easier to forgive the obvious and repetitive symbolism . in a film like timecode , you begin wondering when figgis will ever take off his avant-garde hat and just let a story be a story . i might have considered timecode a thoroughly failed experiment if not for a development that briefly justifies the entire structure . in timecode , i was able to watch tripplehorn throughout the scene , from her puzzled but intent face as the background noise from the screening room prevents her from hearing rose , to the anguish that overwhelms her once it's impossible to deny the truth . film too rarely allows us to watch actors do purely physical acting . i was so fascinated by tripplehorn's wordless performance that i rarely took my eyes off of her quadrant of the screen , even when there was dialogue coming from elsewhere . i'd gladly accept a structure like that in timecode if it meant i could spend time following interesting supporting characters instead of blank-faced bores like burrows' depressed hollywood wife . of course , i'd prefer it if a film-maker acknowledged the importance of developing character and story , rather than assuming falsely that improvisation is always the best way to get at the  truth  of a situation . the snicker itself was a completely believable reaction ; the woman's puzzled expression , as though she had never before in her life heard a joke about her name , strains all credulity . figgis , however , never intrudes on his experiment in realism , not even so it might make more real-world sense . all that remains is his self-congratulation at doing something entirely new , even if it ultimately feels mostly like a big pretentious joke . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject  subscribe  .

"mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 109 minutes . what dreams may come , a sort of post-mortem romantic fantasy-drama , shows us a world which is unlike any we've seen before on screen . oh sure , plenty of films have ventured into the realms of the afterlife , from the sublime ( defending your life ) to the ridiculous ( jacob's ladder ) . this , however , is a heaven of a different , considerably gaudier color . those scenes in chris's heaven-of-his-own-making highlight what dreams may come at its finest , creating spectacularly imaginative visions of the next world . unfortunately , those same scenes also highlight the film's most glaring weakness . it's an inevitable part of metaphysical fantasies like this that someone has to bring the audience up to speed on exactly what they're seeing and why . that doesn't make it any less tedious , especially when what dreams may come isn't supposed to be about what makes particular cosmic gears turn the way they do . the scenes of chris's earthly life with his family , strewn throughout the film in a near-subliminal series of flashbacks , form a potent back-story of a life which isn't as suburban-ideal as it first appears . there's something compelling about the suggetion that love doesn't have to be perfect to be powerful . those emotions should have carried what dreams may come to a transcendent level , if not for those nagging distractions . it's not just the constant exposition which causes the problems , either . an even bigger distraction is robin williams , whose performance can't quite capture the aching love he's supposed to be feeling . williams is certainly a fine performer , but there are times when he's giving a  serious  performance that he looks like he's trying way too hard . the furrows in his brow , the perpetually fidgeting lip and the over-dramatized line readings turn too many interpersonal moments into exercises in how not to act on the big screen . annabella sciorra's convincing anguish could have grounded the story in heart-breaking reality if williams hadn't kept pulling it into melodrama . again , the marvelous look of the film draws you in , as annie's shattered mindscape takes the form of the nielsens' home turned a desolate grey . and again , a viewer is pulled away from the look of the film by tortuous exposition and emotional confrontations which only feel genuine on one side . what dreams may come will likely wring tears from those entranced by the ghost-like prospect of romance beyond the pale . for others , it will seem like a missed opportunity . if a tale of primal fears and primal emotions can't grab you without a nattering narrator , something's very wrong . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line  subscribe  .

"a * * * * movie classic from 1987 , it was released theatrically by disney but was basically ignored . featuring a cast of mainly unknown voices in a low-budget production , it is worth renting again and again . sadly , the same cannot be said of its recent direct-to-video sequel , the brave little toaster goes to mars . one viewing is more than sufficient . one hopes the second , and purportedly the last , sequel will prove more imaginative . the series's appliances are among the most lovable animated characters in modern motion pictures . there are also a whole host of unnecessary new characters to clutter up what should be a simple story and cast . carroll , whose most recent movie , playing by heart , suffered from stiff dialog with excessive cleverness , comes up with a script this time that is almost terminally bland . the basic setup for the plot holds little promise , and carroll finds little interesting to do with it . or as our hero , the toaster , puts it better ,  the little master has been spacenapped !  the original movie had a cornucopia of sweetly hilarious lines that were full of poignancy and pathos . the deeply empathetic , little appliances were absolutely lovable . they still are , but this time they are being held hostage in a lackluster movie that isn't worthy of them . in order to pad the time to get the movie past the minimum time necessary to be considered a full-length feature , they inject a half-dozen , imminently forgettable songs . a helium , hippie balloon that's been floating in space since woodstock , sings one especially dull one . once the appliances get to mars , any hope for them to encounter some well-drawn villains , who could add some much-needed tension to the movie , vanishes . they shout , but they are far from threatening . the only truly funny part of the movie comes in the casting of a cameo . for the part of the faucet , they chose -- who else ? -- farrah fawcett . it is not rated but would certainly be a g , as it is appropriate for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 9 , kind of liked the movie , especially the character of blanky , and gave it * * . he complained that the sequel was a little stupid and the songs were not memorable . a big fan of the original , he thought this one wasn't near as good .

"before sunrise is a romantic talkfest . it is a two character movie featuring julie delpy ( last seen in white ) and ethan hawke . the movie happens almost in real time since it all takes place in less than 24 hours . the movie has a realness to it that approaches almost a documentary feel . this is not surprising since it was written and directed by richard linklater whose first movie was the black and white avant-garde slacker . before sunrise , on the other hand , is a main stream movie albeit one with a wonderfully fresh approach . as one who has traveled on trains where i was constantly overhearing conversations in languages i knew little of , this was so familiar . they talk about everything as the script is written bright , interesting , and extremely natural . many lines were worth remembering . i could see this scene again and again . if you love trains and vienna , as i do , this movie will be a special treat for you . you get to see the prater amusement park , the opera house , demels coffee house , and many other landmarks , but the movie is no travelogue ; it is about conversations and romance . notice , i said romance as in infatuation and kissing . whether anything more transpires between them , you will have to see the show . the scenes where they discuss how far to take their friendship that evening are natural , honest , and a lot of fun to eavesdrop on . through out the show , i laughed out loud many times at the sort of natural things that can happen in romantic conversation . what would i change about the show ? almost nothing . i do think i would have him lose that goatee . it was too 50s beatnik looking . the acting was terrific . it was easy to identify with the characters , and you certainly cared a lot about both of them . you really wonder when you leave the show what are they doing now and then you pinch yourself and remember that it was fiction . the largest amount of credit has to go to the writer/director who was confident enough of his script and cast to let the two leads just talk constantly for the entire movie . before sunrise runs a well paced 1 : 40 . it is incorrectly rated r . this is without a doubt a pg-13 show . it has absolutely nothing to offend other than some uses of the f word . i recommend it to anyone , but especially to romantics and to lovers of the english language . if you have to have a lot of action or a strongly driven plot , you may be disappointed by the movie as it has neither . it easily won a * * * 1/2 rating in my book . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : january 29 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

" i'd rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell ,  earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher . with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister , hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story . instead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god . and arguably just as surprising , the good-spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments . instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures . robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film's director , writer , executive producer , and chief financier . rarely has a movie been such a labor of love . with a white suit , peach-colored shirt and tie , and dark sunglasses , sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher . duvall has every movement down pat .  i may be on the devil's hit-list , but i'm on god's mailing list ,  he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent . and they lap it up . people jump up , scream ,  praise the lord !  and mean it . the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable . but sonny is no saint . his romance with the separated woman , like the rest of the film , doesn't follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies . his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show's many surprising scenes , again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take . although it probably couldn't have ended any other way , the movie does wrap things up nicely . and don't miss the sweet epilogue during the film's closing credits . a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film . it is rated pg-13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up .

"screenplay : paul rudnick . director : barry sonnenfeld . there were plenty of things surrounding the first addams family film that i hated more than the film itself : its undeserved status as blockbuster ; the stupendously annoying theme song by hammer ; endless iterations of the word  ooky  in print . 1991's the addams family was not a terrible film . it was high-spirited and gleefully performed . it simply exhausted its premise after about fifteen minutes . addams family values is lots more of the same , which means that its premise is exhausted before it begins . yet it's both worse and better than its predecessor , the latter the result of christina ricci's marvelously morbid wednesday . like many recent megasequels , addams family values meticulously recreates the original , element for element . the script is once again largely a collection of black-humored sight gags and one-liners , and the theme song is again rap ( a slightly altered version of tag team's excruciating hit  whoomp ! even the title design is the same ;  no surprises  is clearly the motto in place . the only real question is , is it funny , and as in the case of the addams family the answer is  sometimes .  there aren't as many laughs as there were in the original , but the laughs that do come are bigger . there's a great photo among the shots of debbie's previous disguises , and the summer camp play is an anarchic riot . what almost never worked for me were the jokes in the  setup . . . macabre retort  format . i kept wanting to yell out ,  all right , they're weird , i get the point .  values is broken into three almost entirely unrelated subplots ( not that plot is an issue here ) . the debbie/uncle fester plot is extremely sluggish ; joan cusack tries gamely , but doesn't quite click as the villainous black widow . the biggest surprise may be that gomez and morticia play a very small role in the proceedings . they get a nice , goofy dance sequence , but for most of the film raul julia only reacts , while anjelica huston spends her time hitting lighting marks so that her eyes and cheekbones appear translucent . the summer camp subplot is far and away the best , and ricci is a demonic delight . ricci spits out her lines with comic venom , and provides most of values' highlights . the easiest conclusion to reach about addams family values is that it will probably please those it was made to please , the same folks who brought over $100 million to the addams family . if you didn't like the original formula , there's little to inspire a change of heart the second time around . she deserves better .

"there is a scene about half way through blood and wine which , for the briefest of moments , inspires the giddy sense that you may be seeing something quite different . seconds later , you realize you aren't ; within a few minutes , you realize you're watching a movie with an inordinate fondness for inflicting punishment on its characters , and nicholson just happened to be first in line . with all the consternation over violence in the movies , you could easily forget that the kind of violence you tend to see in movies is fairly distant and antiseptic : gunfights in which people fall over like kids on a playground , comic book hand-to-hand combat where the winner walks away with a split lip and a smudged forehead . blood and wine may be the most brutal film ever made in which a gun is never fired . add a slow death after a car accident and a scene of nicholson suturing his own eyebrow , and you have a thriller strictly for the strong of stomach . with all the unpleasantness blood and wine asks its viewers to tolerate , you'd think it would offer a more satisfying pay-off for all the time spent shifting in their seats . that certainly creates an appropriately dark tone , but there is scarcely a drop of wit to lighten the relentless gloom . after recent films like bound have found a way to make you giggle at the tough talk even as you are engrossed in the story , blood and wine comes off as something to be endured rather than enjoyed . it might have helped a bit if there had been a hero worth rooting for . he sneers defiant insults at stepfather alex and falls in lust at first sight with gabriela , all the while acting like a 14-year-old rather than a 24-year-old . his refusal to get a life of his own might have made sense if the script had really followed up on a whisper of oedipal sub-text between jason and suzanne ; instead , you just want him to stop pouting and find an apartment . the only genuinely interesting think in blood and wine -- and it is a very interesting thing -- is michael caine's performance as victor . caine gives victor the weight of a shakespearean villain , his rotting body a reflection of his rotted morality , but his actions always seem born of fear rather than spite . only caine keeps you watching when your better judgment recommends turning away from blood and wine , a film where you find yourself ducking to avoid the psychic shrapnel as characters inflict pain on each other as though it were their job .

( the film makers may have miscalculated here -- the crowd i was with laughed their way through the supposedly-taut climax . ) ( cinematographer doug milsome's glorious scenic shots are easily breakdown's highlight . ) but that's not the worst aspect of the situation -- jeff and amy think they're being stalked by another driver ( m . c . i have just described about the first thirty minutes of the movie , and it doesn't sound bad at all . take a little hitchcock , a dash of steven spielberg's duel , and a pinch of the vanishing , and you get a fair approximation of the level at which breakdown begins . that's a lofty perch to start from , which means that it's a long way down , and , unfortunately , breakdown plummets the entire distance . the ending has more in common with sloppy , cliched , psycho-killer thrillers like unlawful entry and benefit of the doubt ( the setting reminded here me of that one ) than with anything fashioned by a respectable director . the three leads -- kurt russell , j . t . walsh , and kathleen quinlan - - do the best they can with cardboard , one-dimensional roles , but the script's banality defeats them . of course , they can't be held entirely blameless for this debacle , since they agreed to appear in it . given his recent track record , which includes the white-knuckler executive decision , i would never have guessed that russell was so hard up for a job that he'd have to accept something of this sort . thrillers don't have to be realistic to work . take speed , for example . there's no way that the bus could have cleared the gap in the road . but we believed it because the movie had painstakingly created an  alternative reality  in which such gravity-defying feats were possible . breakdown never does that , and , as a result , its increasingly- preposterous turns come across as laughable . his pedestrian direction and unoriginal script diffuse any tension that breakdown might have generated . if this movie was a car , it would have been hauled off to the junk yard as soon as it started falling apart -- a process that is well underway by the half-way point .

"any traditional version of shakespeare's  richard iii  will open with  now's the winter of our discontent made summer by this son of york  , the first line of one of the bard's best-known soliloquies . this movie , a labor of love for al pacino , who makes his directorial debut , does not intend to present a complete , unabridged version of the text . looking for richard is a condensed version of  richard iii  wrapped in a stream-of-consciousness documentary . i don't think it's a serious concern , however . the primary audience will be shakespeare buffs , and , even if they have seen mckellan's adaptation , they won't mind . besides , the films , despite telling essentially the same story , have vastly different approaches . richard iii translates the play to a 20th century , pseudo- nazi england while looking for richard keeps the original historical context intact but adds a great deal of work-in-progress footage . pacino begins the film as a documentary investigating what modern day audiences think of shakespeare's works . the answers he gets during person-on-the-street interviews are predictable :  it sucks  ,  it's boring  ,  huh ?  the director's motivation for making the movie is stated up front :  it has always been a dream of mine to communicate how i feel about shakespeare to others .  to do this , pacino interviews numerous actors and scholars . we glimpse the casting process and are given an impromptu history lesson about the war of the roses ( which functions as background material ) . someone in the crew worries that no one knows  richard iii  , but the assertion is made that it's the most often-performed of all of the bard's plays . and , although the documentary portion of looking for richard is largely over at this point , occasional interludes throughout the remainder of the film return to this format . the second half of looking for richard concentrates on performing select scenes from the play . although perhaps only a third of the full text is used , even someone who has never seen  richard iii  should have no problem following what's happening ( pacino's narrative interruptions attempt to explain potentially-confusing issues ) . the unconventional method of filming , which becomes a little wearisome through repetitiveness , must have required extensive time in the editing room . there are lots of quick shots that switch between a full , costumed version of a play and a simple read-through . at times , looking for richard recalls vanya on 42nd street , although this movie makes the behind-the-scenes sequences a more important part of the whole . a number of familiar faces fill roles here . it's worth noting that , while the play sequences appear to have been produced over a relatively short period of time , the entire film has taken years to piece together , as is evident from pacino's constantly changing appearance ( short hair and a beard in one scene , clean-shaven with long , flowing locks in the next ) . although pacino is attempting to make  richard iii  accessible to the  average  movie-goer , he probably doesn't succeed . looking for richard is a fascinating piece of film making , but i don't think it does anything so revolutionary that non-believers will be suddenly converted . pacino's passion is obvious , but it's not universally contagious . however , those who enjoy shakespeare , or are at least open-minded , will find much to appreciate here . looking for richard is unlike any previous adaptation of the bard's work , and that's reason enough to give it a shot . -- ingmar bergman ",2,0.0,0.29867797367,0.70132202633
"screenplay : d . v . producers : tim bevan and rudd simmons . director : stephen frears . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 110 minutes . at first glance , there's every reason to believe john cusack is the ideal cast for rob gordon , the protagonist of high fidelity . few actors could pull off the amount of narration required of rob without becoming instantly annoying ; even fewer could make self-absorption somewhat sympathetic . so why does cusack seem ever-so-slightly wrong in a role that should be so right ? it's not the sharp comic setting crafted by director stephen frears and a team of four writers ( adapting nick hornby's novel ) . cusack is fine as the saner center , but his co-stars are superb . black's barry is an aggressive , abrasive pedant who delights in the power of dispensing arcana or withholding a rare record ; louiso's dick is a portrait in awed fan-geek deference . it's not the focus on rob's relationship history , either . the gimmicky casting is occasionally distracting , but not so much so that it overwhelms the strengths of the individual episodes . there's even some charming wisdom in high fidelity's acknowledgement that middle school make-out sessions can stay with you for life , or that a skillfully made mix tape can speak from the heart . no , the one key problem with an otherwise thoroughly entertaining film is that cusack's screen persona is just too . . . nice . rob is a somewhat unreliable narrator , since it is gradually revealed that he's caused just as much emotional damage as has been done to him . combine his romantic irresponsibility with his musical snobbery , and you've got a character that should be played with more jerkish , immature edge . with cusack , the nice guy is too dominant . rob's confessions -- which should have played as calculated attempts to win us to his side -- feel more like guileless soul-baring coming from cusack's mouth . and they never quite feel right . it's only then that you can feel enthusiastic about wishing for rob's happiness . high fidelity's sharp wit could have made up for a multitude of sins , when in fact it only has to make up for one ; there's more than enough quality film-making to weigh in the film's favor . there's also that nagging realiation that rob's not the good-natured hero we all want him to be when john cusack is playing the part . cusack has proven himself to be a talented , versatile actor , but there's a guy we've come to know and love in off-beat romantic comedies like the sure thing , say anything and grosse pointe blank , and it's hard not to listen to cusack reveal personal traumas without expecting that guy . even when high fidelity is at its most inspired , you can tell that rob gordon isn't that guy . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject  subscribe  .

"lazenby makes the mistake of trying to imitate connery rather than giving his own interpretation to the role , and as we all know , imitations just make us yearn for the genuine article . lazenby , an exceedingly plain looking actor devoid of much personality , lacks connery's handsome face as well as his suave demeanor . he went on to appear in the television soap opera  general hospital  and in many minor films . but , thankfully , he never again attempted the travesty of acting the bond role . ( bond films titillate with hints of nudity and sex while showing neither . the line pokes fun at the switch but also serves to remind us that our old favorite is gone .

"screenplay : leslie bohem . director : roger donaldson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , intense situations ) running time : 105 minutes . i have been anticipating the arrival of dante's peak , the first of 1997's two volcano films , with a combination of dread and . . . well , still more dread . the return of the disaster film has been about as welcome a pop culture phenomenon as 70s nostalgia , both of them reincarnating uncalculated vapidity as calculated vapidity . it only takes one twister to turn you off the genre ; throw in independence day and daylight and any critic could be excused for walking into dante's peak with an attitude . but if i have to sit through more disaster films , i only hope they can be as thrilling as dante's peak . though just as plot- and character-impaired as its genre cousins , dante's peak delivers a solid hour of relentless tension and excitement . dante's peak is a strange kind of success , because it includes many of the noteworthy flaws of twister , and then some . we get the same obligatory romantic pair thrown into danger with a minimalist back-story tagged on , along with a team of quirky scientists to provide comic relief . brosnan is ruddy and somber for most of the film's running time , hamilton is frazzled and likeable , and both of them trudge dutifully through fifty minutes of exposition as though any unnecessary acting might tire them out before the big finish . leslie bohem ( the scripter of record on daylight , apparently a specialist in films which end with traumatized people wrapped in heavy blankets ) also adds a dose of jaws , but doesn't give us the pleasure of an actual villain . charles hallahan provides the political voice who ends up causing more damage , and there is a teasing sub-plot about a potentially skittish business developer . neither one offers enough conflict , however , forcing the audience to sit and wait out the plodding first half for the big show . and what a show it turns out to be . the surprising thing about the post-eruption second half of dante's peak isn't necessarily that it is effective , but that the reason for its effectiveness doesn't exist entirely on a hard drive somewhere . there are certainly a few impressive visual effects sequences , including a cloud packing the concussive force of a small nuclear weapon , but director roger donaldson gets just as much mileage out of the time-honored technique of jiggling the camera to represent an earthquake . no , dante's peak is an effective thriller because the characters repeatedly find themselves in new and apparently impossible situations , and the direction gives those sequences an edge-of-the-seat tension . from a dizzying truck ride through town destined for the universal studios tour , to the crossing of a flood-threatened bridge , to a mine shaft which threatens to turn brosnan into a sardine , dante's peak provides the kind of relentless , well-crafted action which is what movie-goers should be talking about when they talk about certain films being like roller-coasters . the biggest surprise of all may be that the man behind that action is donaldson , who has served up cinematic backwash like species , the getaway and cocktail . it is an eerie moment , and donaldson manages to get you itching for the fate of the characters even though they haven't been given any personalities . more impressive still , he does it without assaulting your senses . there is , however , something rare in a film which can generate the kind of tension dante's peak generates . maybe it is possible to present a disaster without being one .

"sudden death is a jean claude van damme action film . if you feel like a die hard ii type of movie and are ready to switch your brain to autopilot , this movie will provide an acceptable time at the bijou . sometimes after a hard week at work , you want a little fast paced albeit highly implausible compendium of chases and shoot 'em ups . it's the seventh game of the stanley cup playoffs . think about the title , and you can write most of the rest of the movie yourself without gene quintano's simplistic script . the director ( peter hyams ) has a spartan approach that sticks to action ( read killing ) without much worry about plausibility . i never realized how many ways there are to kill people in a kitchen . the lines are broadly written and sometimes funny . the pacing by editor steven kemper is clean and crisp . this movie is pure escapism and action scenes . think of it as die hard ii crossed with black sunday . if that is what you want , you could worse that sudden death . not particularly original , but funny nevertheless . i find jean claude van damme a strange actor . he does not have the charisma of a steven seagal or the energy of a bruce lee and yet his low key approach to killing bad guys holds a certain fascination no matter how ridiculous . powers boothe is always good as an evil figure and here he gives his standard performance . the best scene of all , and one worthy of a much higher quality movie , is the one where van damme gets to suit up and go on the ice . it is wonderful . it is rated r for massive violence which sometimes makes you squeamish but more often is more cartoonish than anything . after you see scores of people killed with little small bullet holes in the head , it becomes more unreal than frightening . i think the show is acceptable for teenagers if they are mature . i can not bring myself to recommend sudden death , but it did provide a nice diversion albeit a totally forgettable one . i give the film * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

( presumably , miramax is offering the horseman as an alternative for anyone seeking something with more substance than twister or mission : impossible . ) other than a few pregnant glances , these two don't share much in the way of intimacy . they don't even kiss . a little extra heat might have made for a more powerful romance -- at times , the horseman on the roof takes restraint too far . love and emotion aside , this is a wonderful spectacle , and , with all the action and adventure , it's an undeniably enjoyable romp . even those who typically shun france's more artistic fare will be entertained by this big-budget feature . not counting the subtitles , it's the kind of thing that hollywood would be proud of . there's nothing in this film that american audiences can't relate to . although much of the horseman on the roof is more lighthearted than many sweeping melodramas , there are moments of stark , horrifying power . most deal with the effects of cholera on france's unprepared populace . it's a chillingly memorable moment . this is one of the most lavish , recent french exports , and the production values are top-notch . rappeneau ( cyrano de bergerac ) directs with a sure hand , martinez and binoche do credible ( if not spectacular ) jobs , and cameos by francois cluzet and the ubiquitous gerard depardieu add a few brief moments of  star power  . despite all of this , however , the horseman on the roof is not a transcendent experience . but , while it doesn't have the power to get eyes misty and hearts aflutter , it's still entertaining enough to make the two hours pass quickly .

"relying on the ruth prawer jhabvala's superficial and ill-focused script was probably his worst . surviving picasso is a passable film , but it's far from the kind of powerful motion pictures the producer/director team of merchant/ivory was turning out just a few years ago . merchant/ivory at their best means thought-provoking , emotionally wrenching drama that affects both heart and mind . howards end and the remains of the day are both amazing feats of film making -- deep , resonant studies of repression . surviving picasso isn't close to the same level . this shallow , almost-trite movie details picasso's interactions with one of his many mistresses without ever giving us a meaningful portrayal of any of the characters involved , including the painter and the woman . we go into a film like this expecting a full meal , but emerge never having gotten to the entree . there are moments when surviving picasso rises above the ongoing soap opera of francoise's attempts to make a life with her older lover -- brief discussions of painting , picasso's adept handling of art dealers , and an enjoyable interlude with henri matisse ( joss ackland ) . during these sequences , ivory's movie shines , but they represent a minority of the two-plus hour running time . of course , it can be argued that no film with anthony hopkins could be all bad . his picasso is nothing to be ashamed of : passionate , charismatic , and enigmatic . though he puts francoise through hell , he is never intentionally cruel , nor is he ever abusive or violent . picasso , as presented here , can often be short-tempered , insensitive , and neglectful , but he is never blatantly hurtful . hopkins displays all of the painter's faults while exhibiting a vulnerability that allows us to sympathize with him . newcomer natascha mcelhone , who plays francoise , has an attractive enough face and figure , but doesn't display great range . she's fine in most of the low-key scenes , but doesn't appear comfortable with displays of deep emotion . of the supporting performers , julianne moore stands out as the most memorable . her dora marr , a hardened , bitter woman , gives us a keen sense of the lasting damage picasso is capable of inflicting . even that would be okay if there was real depth and energy to their interactions , but , even given the acting talents of anthony hopkins , surviving picasso can't manage better than spotty character development . occasionally , francoise and picasso come across as real individuals , but rarely do they click as a couple . there's never any heat , even when francoise first disrobes in front of the painter ( in fact , considering hopkins' startled reaction , this scene is actually more funny than erotic ) . with ismail merchant producing , james ivory directing , and anthony hopkins starring in a film based on the life of one of the most colorful and influential artists of this century , a movie-goer is justified in expecting a film of epic scope . surviving picasso definitely doesn't fit the bill , and , as a result , represents the second straight disappointment to come from merchant/ivory .

"the birdcage is a well constructed one joke movie that audiences seem to love and that some critics like and others don't . this critic admired robin williams's performance as well as some of the minor actors , but found the film's depiction of gay people more insulting to them than funny . then again , perhaps i am too sensitive or maybe i just want more from a movie than caricature . the birdcage is based on the french film la cage aux folles . although the other male singers in the club are quite convincing as females , albert isn't and looks more like a male actor trying to play a transvestite . this is consistent with lane's performance . although i found williams believable as gay , lane overacted so much that i never found his character believable . the screen adaptation by elaine may ridicules senator dole by name many times in order to make the movie topical and to make sure that audience knows they are serious about the republican hypocrisy point . let's cut to chase . the reason i do not like the show is the repeated single joke . every time he hits the pinkie , the audience roars . in general , every exaggerated gay behavior sends the audience wild . i found the antics demeaning to gays and highly repetitious . the audience gets to laugh at him a lot , and i do mean  at  him , because he can not walk in shoes without falling on everyone and because he is portrayed as both a stupid character and one whose sole , supposed charm is that he has a strange accent . this character is the most insulting of them all . director mike nichols should have been ashamed to have used such cheap shots . there are some lines i liked . albert , trying his best to act macho , answers in an attempted deeper voice with ,  how do you think i feel ? there are two aspects of the show that deserve special mention . full of bright colors of limes , yellows , and roses . the costumes , especially those of armand's done by stephen shubin , are both outlandish and visually compelling . there is one actress in the movie that plays the secretary to val's biological mother . she is not listed anywhere on the web , which really bothers me . i know i have seen her somewhere before but i can not figure out where . if anyone knows , i wish they would drop me a line . she has a trivial part in the film , it is just that i can not figure out where i saw her before . the birdcage runs a little too long 1 : 58 thanks to editor arthur schmidt . the film is rated r for some mild language . there is no sex , nudity or violence . the film should be fine for teenagers . although i do not recommend this show , i should point out in fairness that my wife liked it and was laughing right along with most of the rest of the audience . i suspect the film will make a bundle . i give the movie * 1/2 for william's performance plus the well done minor performances of flockhart and wiest , but i found little worth rewarding in the rest of the cast and found the script demeaning to gays and insulting to republicans . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"an enjoyable b- movie but not quite as good as its reputation suggests it would be . if you can suspend critical judgment regarding the thinness of the story and the robotic acting and taut dialogue that should have been made funnier instead of playing it so straight , then you should be in a receptive mood for what the 1950s took for schlock cyberspace . we are in the prime time of hardened cold war attitudes , which are bristling with military solutions and a case of good old paranoia to keep us on our toes . so what better or easier target for all our pent up anxieties , than for the martians to be the bad guys . now there might be just as many people in this country who believe in flying saucers as there are who don't , so when we see a flying saucer land in someone's backyard and disappear in the ground , the film is on familiar sci-fi turf . in this cheapie production , he makes the most of the sets he created , and in the final battle scenes between the army and the martians , they look good enough to add a certain amount of necessary chills to the film . anyway , life on mars doesn't seem so hot , so why not come to america the land of opportunuty , a haven for those seeking a better life . the only thing serious about this movie , is that it was done in a serious manner . aside from that , it's a harmless tingler with enough thrills in it to make it pleasantly watchable . it is one of those movies where you can find enough in it to think it wasn't so bad ; and , it really wasn't so bad when you come to think about it . the most interesting part of it , is that it gives you a clear view of 1950s attitudes . it reflected a time that was much different from the way things are now : parents spoke to their children in a respectful manner and vice versa , there was a na ? vet ? in its political concerns , and it idealized the small town concepts of america . there are many old-timers who wish america could return to those simpler times . . . even though those times had masked the bigger problems they couldn't face , the problems that blew up in the '60s and changed the language and attitudes of the country . this film was made 46 years ago but seems as if it came from a nostalgic time that will never be with us again . it is worth seeing mainly for those reasons .

( niggaz with hats ) , whose members are rappers ice cold ( rusty cundieff ) and tasty taste ( larry b . scott ) and dj tone def ( mark christopher lawrence ) . in terms of plot structure , it often seems that writer/ director/star rusty cundieff decided simply to  colorize  spinal tap . it is not simply the framing device which is borrowed , but a multitude of specific details : gigs with somewhat insulting billing on the marquis ; internal squabbles triggered by a domineering girlfriend ; tap's series of ill-fated drummers replaced by n . w . h . 's series of ill-fated managers . yet with all these borrowed elements , there are a couple of other things cundieff might have been well-served to duplicate . one is keeping the framing structure consistent . frequently the camera work breaks out of the verite style for shots a single-camera documentary really couldn't be filming . the other is keeping the performances as deadpan as possible . if fear of a black hat tends to stumble , it's when it veers into campiness . even then , there are some huge laughs to be had in black hat . tone def's solo project is a hilarious bit modeled after p . m . but cundieff is perhaps most adept at skewering rap's self-important politics through ice cold's wonderfully improbable explanations of how songs such as  booty juice  actually contain an important social message . even the misogyny in rap culture is nailed perfectly in a single line , perhaps the film's funniest ( be sure to stay through the credits or you'll miss it ) . there are a lot of great details in fear of a black hat ( my favorite being tasty taste's massive bowling-trophy-on-a-chain necklace ) , which makes it frustrating that cundieff often plays up the broader bits . an obligatory scene in which ice cold is pulled over and hassled by a rent-a-cop is dragged out far too long , and a parody of new jack city seems only to serve as a way to take a jab at black filmmakers (  jike spingleton  is the director ) . still , i laughed harder and more often at fear of a black hat than at any other movie in quite some time . make sure you're in the house when n . w . h .

"walsh , e . g . marshall , david paymer , david hyde pierce director : oliver stone producers : clayton townsend , andrew g . vanja , and oliver stone screenplay : oliver stone , stephen j . rivele , and christopher wilkinson cinematography : robert richardson music : john williams u . s . distributor : hollywood pictures it's always a tricky proposition to make a motion picture based on recent history -- and the more public the episode , the more difficult it is for the film maker to balance drama with accuracy . this is especially true when that film maker is oliver stone , a director known more for self-aggrandizement than for the thoughtful handling of difficult issues . it's entirely because of stone's reputation that the even- handedness of nixon is such a surprise . while not an unassailable portrait of the late president , this movie at least attempts to present nixon as a human being , with all the failings and greatness inherent in a man of his stature . nixon is portrayed an neither demonic nor angelic . this is a rare occasion where stone's script is more concerned with executing a character study than pushing a political agenda . the film even ends with a touching tribute culled from nixon's funeral last year . that's not to say that stone has stuck entirely to the historical record . one wonders if stone didn't include this bit just to incite controversy and raise a few eyebrows . nixon is not a simple regurgitation of historical events . in fact , history is used primarily as the backdrop against which this character study takes place . less a biography than an impressionist's vision , the film may disappoint those expecting a vitriolic attack on someone who is surely not among stone's heroes . but the lead personae , as realized by anthony hopkins , isn't reduced to an unthinking , unfeeling caricature . while nixon is depicted as a paranoid , borderline-megalomaniac , he's also shown to have deep moral convictions , a strong sense of loyalty , and a love of his country . the drama plays out in a shakespearean fashion , with nixon's tragic flaw of hubris clearly in evidence . hopkins is not heavily made up -- and therefore doesn't really look like his character -- but his mannerisms are perfect and he is allowed a full range of facial expressions ( unlike robert duvall in stalin ) . hopkins does far more with acting than fake jowls could ever accomplish . the film's structure is disjointed , especially during the first hour , as the narrative skips back and forth through time from watergate to 1960 to the 1920s and 30s . stone is giving us a snapshot of nixon's life , but it comes in such a random and haphazard fashion that it dims the dramatic impact and dilutes early character development . it's not until the film's second hour , as nixon faces the dilemma of how to end the vietnam war , that hopkins' character starts to click . stone's penchant for bizarre cinematography damages the film more often than not . many of the odd camera angles , film stock switches , and surrealistic superimposed backdrops are distracting rather than effective . unfortunately , this has become one of stone's trademarks ; he seems unable to make a film without making some kind of statement to the effect of :  look at me ! i'm an artist !  nixon would have been better focused without such grandstanding . there are several memorable scenes in nixon and these , along with hopkins' outstanding portrayal , keep the viewer engaged . nixon really doesn't offer any surprising insights , nor does it break new ground for the director . this is a dynamic -- if flawed -- look at the man who , for better and for worse , changed america's place in the world and its perception of itself . there are few who do not have an opinion of nixon . and , factual or not , there's no denying that nixon has moments when it is nothing short of compelling .

"the problem with movies like rush hour 2 that give away almost all of the good jokes in the trailers is that seeing the movie itself is about as much fun as watching reruns . in rush hour 2 , this problem is further compounded by the lack of freshness in the jokes themselves . the movie's almost saving grace is that it stars that teddy bear of a martial arts comedic hero , jackie chan . and women , if you do have a thing for jackie , you'll be glad to know that you'll get a chance to catch a glimpse of his naked buttocks this time . blink , and you'll miss it . they have good chemistry together even if tucker keeps trying to upstage chan . but , if you've seen the trailers , you already know the joke . the setup this time , to the extent that one is needed in a chan movie , concerns the thwarting of an international counterfeiting ring . don cheadle has a cameo that works best in the outtakes , just about always the best part of any chan film anyway . as always , chan is lovable , funny and vulnerable . unlike most action heroes , his pain is palpable . working from an unimaginative script by ross lamanna , director brett ratner is never able to get the pacing right , with long slack sections slowing the momentum between funny moments . in the movies today , all roads lead to las vegas , where the neon glitters and all of the buildings are little more than movie sets for adults . rush hour 2 ends there in a burst of glory that hints at what could have been if the rest of the movie were better written and more tightly paced . it is rated pg-13 for action violence , language and some sexual material and would be acceptable for kids around 8 and up . they both thought that it was funny and had well planned out laughs . in the silicon valley it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word  subscribe  in the subject line .

"tie me down ! ) never does anything in a conventional manner , and kika is no exception . a black farce on sex , violence , and the attraction held by both for the general public , kika is one of those films that causes the mpaa to get nervous . as a result , this admittedly explicit motion picture was given an nc-17 . the real problem with kika is that , while it's moderately entertaining and occasionally riotously funny , one of the first thoughts after leaving the theater is likely to be along the lines of  what was the point of that ?  as a satirical social commentary , the film is surprisingly shallow , not to mention insensitive . it's easy to see how some viewers could be offended by the cavalier , jokey manner in which rape and incest are portrayed . the plum role belongs to victoria abril , portraying a  journalist  who makes geraldo rivera look like a serious tv newsman . with a camera mounted atop some sort of futuristic-looking headgear , she goes from crime scene to crime scene , hoping to catch a murder or something equally as juicy . this satire on tabloid tv and the public's fascination with it is done with scalding insight and an indifference to political correctness . almodovar has never worried about being accused of going too far , and the viewer's reaction to kika may reflect how much distance along this path they're willing to go with the writer/director . the title character is a bit flighty , and more than a little afraid of a commitment . for the first two-thirds of the movie , kika lies at the center of everything that's going on . removing the main character from the climax is a strange way to structure a movie . kika is too long , and the ending doesn't fit well with the much-better first half . by trying to tie all the disparate themes and storylines together at the end , almodovar creates a chaotic mess that is never successfully untangled . there are a number of dead bodies , but no real sense of closure . there's no doubt that kika does exactly what almodovar intended it to . from its moments of inspired comedy to its descent into bad taste , the director's indelible signature is woven into the fabric of the film . this movie is likely to offend as many as it appeals to , and i felt a little of the pull in both directions . ultimately , however , almodovar's central parody is strong enough to save this film from floundering too much or too often . it's daring and nasty , but rarely brilliant .

"titantic , writer and director james cameron's much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ? as a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful . if you've already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again . the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world's most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers . in either case , it is filmmaking at its best . when we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long . he said no but that the time would go by so fast she'd never notice the length . amazingly , he was right . titanic is one of the few long films that doesn't suffer because of it . although almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk . using a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing . in a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast . the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing . never tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story . leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma . when he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal's supercilious put-downs . kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose . the chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what's eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing . if the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year . peter lamont's sets are more than authentic . it then shifts to the ship's massive gears and then to the bright-hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals . easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest . at first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else . what a lark . we've struck an iceberg . their civility borders on insanity , but it is touching nevertheless . the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface . there are more than enough characters to love and to hate , and all of the casting is dead-on . special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable . people are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately . besides being romantic and dramatic , the script includes liberal doses of humor . from the many deliciously subtle verbal put-downs to the physical comedy , as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man , the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears . basically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats -- it made the decks look too crowded otherwise . perhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheim's on-board the ship .  no thanks ,  the elegantly attired guggenheim replies .  we're dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen . but we would like a brandy .  it is rated pg-13 for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up .

"there are a few obstacles to this ambition , however - namely a lack of athletic ability and grades too poor to allow him admission to any college . rudy is intended to be a triumphant and inspirational motion picture , and it successfully attains those aims . critics of the film will undoubtedly point out that there are instances when it wallows in sentimentality , but it's difficult to substantiate the charge knowing how much of this film is true-to-life . this version of rudy's story is very close to how things really happened . it's a case when life , not hollywood , wrote the plotline . the ending is not embellished to satisfy the masses ; films of the 1975 game exist to prove that this is exactly how things transpired . of course , there is still a little manipulation involved , but most of it is low-key and skillful . a conscious attempt has been made to avoid an overkill of the  feel good  spirit , but the message is clear : if you put your whole heart and mind to something , there is nothing that can't be accomplished . while this theme might ring hollow in a work of fiction , it has a strong resonance here . the ending of rudy is a victory for one person , and for all those in the audience that come to care about him , but it doesn't fall into the same category as the cliched finales of dozens of other sports films . here , triumph is measured on a different , more personal level , where winning and losing - and even scoring - no longer matter . this is truly an occasion when playing the game is enough . as exhilarating as the film is , it isn't without problems . the most obvious is the choppiness of the story . especially in the middle segments , rudy does a lot of jumping around . i realize that there's a lot to show and tell in this movie , and that condensation was necessary , but the manner in which this was done lacks finesse . the performances of sean astin and charles s . dutton are noteworthy . dutton has an incredible on-screen presence , and his portrayal of rudy's unofficial mentor invests this role with more than might typically be expected from it . astin , a relatively fresh face , has all the tenacity necessary to play the title character . the same  feel  is present , and the ending is as guaranteed to send sprits soaring , whether you're a lover of football or not . it would have been easy to turn rudy's story into a soppy , overly- sentimental journey , but the film makers have avoided too much melodrama . keeping the performances and direction low-key are obviously a part of that , as was having the real rudy on the set every day so that the story remained true to what really happened . the cheers in the audience at the end were genuine , and this is one of the rare times when i will admit to cracking a smile as the credits began to roll .

"screenplay : krzysztof kieslowski and krzysztof piesiewicz . welcome to that annual year-end tradition ,  guess which foreign language film gets jobbed by the motion picture academy rules .  politics and arbitrary interpretations continue to rob the category of worthy nominees , and this year will be no exception : red , the third installment in krzysztof kieslowski's extraordinary three colors trilogy , has been rejected as an entry from switzerland . the academy should rectify that slight immediately and nominate it as one of the best films of the year in any language , a beautiful , resonant work that is the best of three very good films . but the owner , joseph kern ( jean-louis trintingnant ) , appears less than concerned about the dog , or much of anything for that matter . red is for fraternity , but as was also true of blue and white , the treatment of that theme is far from the obvious . this brings up the question of whether it is necessary to have seen blue and white to fully appreciate red . i feel irresponsible discouraging seeing this film in even the slightest manner , because it has so much to offer on its own merits . the production design is stunning , and zbigniew preisner's score again provides amazing depth . that said , i truly believe that there are layers of red which are best understood when viewed through the lens of the complete trilogy . and in red's emotional climax , the lead characters from all three films appear , and an understanding of what those other characters have been through to end up together makes the scene infinitely more potent . that is what makes red so special : it has a scope and a heart which , when combined with blue and white , is truly breathtaking . this is the work of a filmmaker at the height of his creative powers , which makes kieslowski's announcement that he is retiring a genuine tragedy . red stands independently as a great film ; the three colors together create a miraculous tapestry , one of the great film experiences of the decade .

"let me say up front that i have never been especially fond of canadian geese . now that i've made that admission , you might be surprised to learn that i actually liked the goose-fest , fly away home . fly away home starts with one of the most disconcerting scenes i've seen in a recent motion picture : a silent car accident that takes place during the opening credits while a soft , gentle melody plays in the background . the effect created by this juxtaposition of tragic and hopeful elements is sufficient to arrest anyone's attention . and , while the film never again attains this level of artistry , there are a few scenes that come close . caleb deschanel's photography is one of the movie's highlights . her response to that :  that's a lame excuse , dad .  and , of course , it is . as a family film , fly away home has something for members of every temperament and age group : adventure , pathos , technical detail about the design of the aircraft , cute animals , and human drama . there's also a pro-conservation message that , while laudable in intent , comes across as simplistic and heavy-handed ( land developers = bad ; geese = good ) . when she's quiet and reflective , paquin is excellent ; but there are too many instances when she goes overboard . while daniels has something to do , delany is pretty much relegated to the background , although , in the wake of exit to eden and live nude girls , it's a little odd to see her in such a  tame  role . director carroll ballard , who brought 1979's the black stallion to the screen , has long since proven his ability to produce solid family fare . ballard uses this as the backdrop for a warm drama that's more about love and trust between a father and daughter than inter-species connections . the result , even for geese-haters , is charming .

"though poetic justice was a misfire , boyz showed that singleton could tell a story , and after nearly ten years around stanford , one of the nation's hotbeds of multicultural experimentation , i knew that there were many stories to tell . higher learning shows that singleton recognized that fact as well ; unfortunately , he tried to tell them all in one movie . it's an ambitious but unfocused effort which is admirable for its balanced perspective but leaves critical characters as mere representations of the stereotypes it seems to be challenging . for fully half of its running time , higher learning appears to be headed in the right direction . unlike contemporaries oliver stone and spike lee , singleton does know how to present challenging and controversial subject matter without shouting at the top of his lungs in every frame . in a stone film , the hero's two mentors would be manifestations of good and evil ; singleton , on the other hand , makes both fudge and professor phipps smart and sensible characters , leaving the audience to draw its own conclusions . it doesn't hurt that both roles are played by magnetic screen presences . ice cube has true star potential , a powerful personality and a fine actor , and he keeps fudge from being simply a spouter of dogma . laurence fishburne's phipps doesn't really need a west indian accent , but he shows a genuine concern for malik , and also keeps his speeches from sounding didactic . malik's storyline is the most carefully plotted , and omar epps' fine performance as the young man weighing two views of being black in america makes it the most interesting to watch . but singleton fails to give his other two principles the same kind of depth . his story could have been an opportunity to examine why real , intelligent young people feel so threatened in a multi-cultural society , but he's pushed so far to the fringe that he becomes a cartoon . the problems with those two characters are representative of what is most wrong with higher learning , particularly in its second half . higher learning is awash in good intentions , but too often it's terribly simplistic , taking a story which should have been about the shaping of minds and reducing it to a matter of who's got the guns .

"guy ritchie has cleaned up some of the mess he made in this encore to his surprise box-office cult hit  lock , stock and two smoking barrels ,  but has made the same kind of empty , semiserious/comedy/crime caper , with many of the same actors from that film . but , this time the story holds together better and is much more amusing , thanks in a large part to the ensemble cast who come and go in the film with seamless fluidity . it's a film filled with an assortment of colorful runyonesque characters from the underworld of crime , or illegal bare-knuckle boxing matches , or from the outcasts of society . this film , like the director's other one , has no strong role for a woman . the main plot is about a series of mishaps over a stolen diamond that somehow brings together a varied mix of characters who are after it or are inadvertently drawn into its disappearance , but the plot is really irrelevant , it plays as a mcguffin--this is strictly a character driven film , with all the characters being either lively in a cartoonish way , undeveloped , or forgettable . the movie will spin-off in different directions , telling each groups' story , until it all comes together in the last reel and plays itself out . the film is played mostly for the comedy and it throws everything it thinks is crazy into the comic mix , even a shaggy dog story . the language used has many expletives and is often hard to understand because of the heavy accents . the violence is brutal but cartoonish , as the film is styled much like a comic book . the rest of this heavily induced homage to musical video films , has a soundtrack that ranges from massive attack to oasis . ford's menacing psychotic performance , stood out as the film's most memorable one . pitt's self-effacing comedy was the performance i best enjoyed , as it gave the film a sparkling light touch ; while , dennis farina , also , was pleasingly comical and added some light touches to this cartoonish film . the only slow down in the film is in the opening moments , when the large cast of characters is introduced . other than that , the film moves at high speed , with all kinds of film gimmicks , from jump cuts to multi use of graphics . this is a film that thrives on controlled chaos as its signature theme . i would call it another dumb cult picture the director has made , one that suffers because there is no one in this film to care about .

"screenplay : tom schulman . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 93 minutes . is this the plot to weekend at bernie's iii . no , no , thank merciful god in heaven , no . the film in question is 8 heads in a duffel bag , and it's not nearly as awful as its plot or direct-to-video-style title might suggest . there area few moments of gruesome comic brilliance in 8 heads in a duffel bag , most of them involving the strange fates which continuously befall the heads . makeup artist greg cannom ( the mask ) does a delightful job of creating the heads , which keep turning up at inconvenient moments and end up providing the film's best scene during a sweet rendition of  mr . sandman .  when schulman is willing to push the limits of good taste , 8 heads in a duffel bag produces some big laughs , but he should have been willing to push those limits even further , and more often . for the first half of the film , charlie and the bennett family scream and fumble around in a posh mexican hotel in a strained manner , with newcomer comeau trying to carry the farce on his thin shoulders . he needs a lot more help than can be provided by dyan cannon and george hamilton , however ; their presence only serves to give you the feeling that you're watching a dark-humored episode of  the love boat .  while he has a bizarre and original plot device at his disposal , schulman inexplicably resorts to unpleasant mexican stereotypes , cannon's incessant shrieking and a parade of pratfalls . the great gag in pesci's scenes with spade and comeau is that he's much more simple and creative in the tortures he devises for his wimpy captives . it's a great , goofy spin on pesci's stock character , and it gives 8 heads some of its best moments . too bad only pesci seems to realize that fact . schulman actually doesn't seem to know what he wants to do with the characters , resulting sloppy and fairly pointless attempts at providing motivation . none of these snippets of personality amount to anything , however ; they're stock situations which don't even yield stock resolutions . schulman just lets his direction and script wander , getting terribly conventional at the oddest moments and pulling back when he should have been ready to go for the jugular . 8 heads in a duffel bag is just too uneven to be satisfying , even if some individual gags work to perfection . when you're throwing body parts at the audience , you've got to offer more than half-hearted whimsy .

"romance by writer/director catherine breillat is described in the press notes as  a daring exploration of female sexuality from a female point of view .  featuring an order of magnitude more explicit sex than any movie this side of a porn film , the graphic depictions are as joyless and unerotic as a medical textbook . even if breillat has her actors performing actual , not simulated , oral sex , she does it with such a clinical detachment that the only reason to applaud the film is for the risks it is willing to take . making it especially hard to endure , romance's energy level is as low as its depressed heroine's . certainly we have had a large number of movies than explore violence with graphic realism , so why can't similar ones be made with sexual realism ? after all , we as a society are much more threatened by violence than sex . whereas there is a case that can be made for making something this sexually explicit , this movie fails spectacularly . the heroine is one notch above an automaton , thanks to the remoteness of the director's approach . in an excessively serious picture that is never intentionally funny , these scenes of ropes and chains and marie's contorted positions may have some laughing out loud , since they are so ludicrous . he's a good listener . he has other boasts too , all equally bizarre . if you're inclined to check this movie out only because of the titillation factor , don't . there isn't an exciting moment to be found in it . on the contrary , monasteries might be advised to hold recruiting drives in the lobbies . if sex is this miserable , abstinence may be an attractive alternative . the film is in french with english subtitles . the movie , which was not submitted to the mpaa for rating , is filled with actual sex scenes and frequent nudity and would not be appropriate for anyone other than an adult .

"the moody atmospheric film moves at a snail's pace , giving me the impression that it is about to say something important , but everything turns out to lead forlornly down a dead-end . also , the main characters are not the nicest of people , making it difficult to sympathize with them . it could be said that this was one of the director's more trying melodramatic efforts , except for the stylish photography and the use of mediterranean shades of yellow , orange and brown for its outside shots , and for the indoor shots of the many rooms it shows , there are various shades of blue , to give the film a pleasing artistic look . for antonioni , contrast is the main thing to show about life : as sometimes things go good , sometimes things go rotten . the story , the dialogue , the characters , and the pace of the film are done in such a lethargic way , that it radically diminishes the love story . even the sex , which was plentiful , is carried out in such an unenthusiastic way , that it wasn't erotic . yet , what gives the film a certain sense of elegance , underlying its ennui , is that the director is aiming all his guns at being thematic . this is a film that could only expect to be well-received by a receptive intellectual audience of antonioni film buffs , who have the patience and understanding to embrace its arcane premises , vexing story , and the litany of existential themes the director is prone to . niccolo is anxious to find out who she knew that might be doing this , but his search is done in such a half-hearted way , that it creates little tension . the film's main purpose is not the story or the mystery , but in showing the difficulty it is to have a successful relationship in these civilized times . everyone's life seems to be too complicated to just love each other without finding other reasons to either breakup or stay together . the film goes out of its way to show how alienated and isolated the main characters are : mavi and niccolo are driving in a fog that is so thick one can't see anything , as they get lost for awhile while walking on the highway ; there are countless shots of doors opening and closing and of serious people talking to each other but not communicating . the only logical thing niccolo can say at the party to mavi is ,  do all your parties have this sectarian atmosphere ? therefore , he will make a film that is impossible to digest , about spacemen going to the sun to find out what the source of power means to mankind . it's a film stuck on ideas and many metaphors , but they are dragged around by a static story , trying too hard to show how negative and cold the world has become . the film is not helped by having its central character being such a selfish and uncaring dolt , while pretending to be an intellectual . most of the warmth in the film came from the photography , which is not enough of a reason for me to get over how vacant the story felt . yet , it is a film from the master director antonioni , covering his favorite theme of alienation , and he is someone whose poorer films are still worth seeing , as there is always some nugget to be found . the nugget i found , is that the director is suggesting that in this  age of alienation ,  it is more fun and realistic to make a childlike fantasy film than an idealized love story .

"and , while i haven't seen that production , it seems about the right length for this premise , which is too thin to sustain a full-length feature . even though joe's apartment runs a slim seventy-nine minutes , it seems hopelessly padded . there's not enough story here for something half that length , so we're subjected to numerous pointless and irritating song-and-dance numbers designed to nudge the lame plot towards its conclusion . the film doesn't start off badly . in fact , during the first half- hour , there's a quirky comic momentum . there's only one problem -- he has to share his pad with hundreds of singing , dancing cockroaches . as i said , i like the way the film develops in the early stages , taking some chances and daring to be a little different . not much of the comedy is uproarious , but joe's apartment has a few clever moments , at least until it loses its edge . the cockroaches , which are the product of digital animation , are quite real-looking . they're a little less disturbing than the genuine article because they sound like alvin and the chipmunks . the film's greatest failing , however , is the manner in which it treats its human characters . joe is one of the least-interesting personalities to grace the screen this year . despite being described as the  dirtiest freakin' slob on the planet  , he seems remarkably clean , orderly , and well-groomed , although i suppose the occasional smear of dirt on his forehead is supposed to indicate that he never bathes . his girlfriend is equally bland , which means that the only two significant people in this film aren't worth more than a yawn or two . together , these two are more potent than a sominex .  big  cameos come from robert vaughn and don ho , which is a fair indication of the level of talent attracted by the script . not since the brady bunch movie has a film deteriorated this quickly . good beginning aside , the ultimate result is that joe's apartment is full of bugs .

"screenplay : david aaron cohen & vincent patrick & kevin jarre . producers : lawrence gordon and robert f . colesberry . director : alan j . pakula . you can bet that sony pictures executives have spent plenty of time in the last few weeks hoping that there is , in fact , no such thing as bad press . then , in a newsweek interview , brad pitt took a few shots at the mid-stream script changes on his upcoming film the devil's own , inspiring the kind of spin control usually seen only on the teacup ride at disneyland . pitt's comments were surprising in an era when stars are generally obliged to swoon over their latest project , but it may be even more surprising to see the end product of the process which frustrated him so . the devil's own is an uncommonly thoughtful suspense film with a razor-sharp performance by pitt , proving that pitt's standards may be considerably higher than anyone else's in hollywood . if anything , it is the missed opportunities for even more detailed characterizations which end up disappointing . the bonding between them is casual and un-dramatic -- a game of pool here , a snippet of conversation there -- and director alan j . pakula trusts the actors to establish a connection without resorting to trite dialogue or inappropriate outbursts of emotion . we like them , too , and for quite a while both of them are the heroes of the devil's own . . . until pitt plays the anti-hero to ford's more conventional square-jawed hero , and it is hard to choose sides between them . in a film with such an unconventional struggle at its center , it is all the more jarring when conventional formula elements rear their ugly heads . obligatory psycho-villain treat williams gets to ooze malevolence and serve up severed heads ; obligatory romantic interest natascha mcelhone gets to be gorgeous and supportive of frankie . those occurrences are relatively rare , however , because the devil's own doesn't move the way you expect suspense thrillers to move . the action sequences are infrequent but emphatic , with a premium placed on the patient establishment of character . in that scene , tom suggests that he never wanted to be a cop , a sub-text which appears out of nowhere and might have given more depth to the character throughout the film . there are certainly instances where the devil's own feels like the product of a script-by-committee , but the star power of ford and pitt in an intriguing relationship guides it over its rough points . i could only hope to be subjected to more  troubled productions  like this .

"little odessa , the stunning feature debut of 24-year old writer/director james gray , is about to become the victim of distributor politics . as a result of recent changes in upper management , fine line features has chosen to limit--if not completely withdraw--support for this film . considering the strength of the material , the adeptness of gray's direction , and several memorable performances , this is a classic case of cinematic injustice . little odessa deserves to be seen by as many movie-goers as possible , not just those living in the few locations where fine line choses to release it . little odessa is an extremely complex motion picture , layered with powerful themes and fascinating characters . the film's ending has a strong allegorical , as well as dramatic , impact . not only is the final sequence emotionally crushing , but it slams home a vivid and telling message about prices paid by both the innocent and the guilty for crimes within the community . by this performance , tim roth adds yet another impressive credit to his resume . maximilian schell , an accomplished actor who hasn't had much screen exposure in the past few years , encourages in viewers a mixture of resentment and sympathy . moira kelly , despite the most limited screen time of a member of the primary cast , turns in one of the best performances of her career . her confusion , self-doubt , and conflicting feelings for josh , as well as her recognition that the relationship is doomed , add a subdued poignancy to alla that less skillful acting would not have conveyed . edward furlong , a young actor gaining presence with each new role , somewhat underplays reuben , but not to the point where it interferes with the story . vanessa redgrave does her usual fine job . the violence of little odessa is brutal , quick , and always shocking . as in schindler's list , scenes of bloodshed are presented graphically , but never gratuitously . this is a credit to the director , who has a clear vision and uses all the tools at his disposal to attain those ends . because of the richness of the subject matter and the complexity of the characters , gangster movies , especially those with strong ethnic overtones , make excellent vehicles for social commentary . little odessa is the latest example of what such a film can accomplish . with an emotional impact as strong as its intellectual appeal , little odessa is deserving of a far better fate than the one fine line features has consigned it to .

"i'm not saying , but the mayhem that they cause when crossing in toy story 2 is likely to send your audience into a laughing pandemonium as it did ours . part of the charm of the sequel is that we already know and love the characters . the additional casting just adds icing to an already scrumptious cake . the whole point of the opening seems to be to let the crew at pixar animation studios dazzle us with their technical prowess . if that was indeed their goal , they succeeded handsomely . the visual and sound effects are incredible . look out george lucas , a bunch of toys are after your space franchise . this elaborate opening diversion , which the plot manages to make fit into the context of a simple story about andy ( john morris ) and his toys , soon gives way to more familiar surroundings . pixar uses its ever increasing technological sophistication to enhance the settings this time but without changing them . the story , which doesn't quite measure up to the original in the number of memorable lines , does excel in the quality of the physical comedy with the aforementioned road crossing being its pi ? ce de r ? sistance . the screenplay isn't afraid to introduce drama , sadness and moral dilemmas into a g-rated comedy for all ages . it's a sad fact of life in the toy kingdom that all of them are subject to be taken to the dreaded yard sale . this story makes this much more touching and complicated than it might seem . most studios would be proud to have a success every now and then , but pixar , with three wonderful films ( toy story , a bugs life and now toy story 2 ) , is certainly batting a thousand . given the dearth of laudable kids' movies , pixar deserves a huge pat on the back by parents and moviegoers everywhere for giving us such extremely enjoyable g-rated entertainment . it is rated g and would be fine for all ages , including adults with no children whatsoever at the screening i attended were almost all of my son's fifth grade class , and i heard nothing but * * * * ratings from them afterwards . my son , jeffrey , loved the film , mentioning how many hilarious lines there were . his friend nickolas said he thought it was great and that he liked it 100% .

"this movie features lots of gigantic explosions . if you are from boston , you will love the many nice scenes shot on location there . other than as a guide to pyrotechnics or as a travelogue , the only compelling reason to see the show is tommy lee jones . he tries his darndest to shine in a bad movie , and although it is one of the weakest acting jobs i have seen from him , he is still interesting to watch . jeff bridges is an actor who can be pretty pathetic sometimes . this was one of them . lloyd bridges's character was not much , and he did not do much with it . the plot had few twists and could have been written as the term project by anyone taking screen writing 101 at their local community college . the script ( joe bateer , john rice and m . jay roach ) features l-o-n-g slow parts followed by tedious action sequences . the director ( stephen hopkins ) has the actors mumble most of the dialog . jeff bridges is especially good at this . this means that you will not have to bother hearing a fair amount of what they say . this is aided by having the sound editor make the background noise frequently much louder than the actor's speech . listen to them pouring the wine at the restaurant ; it sounds like they are filling a bathtub . given the gibberish of the script you can look upon this as a real blessing of course . the movie gets a well deserved r rating and lasts for a tediously long 2 : 00 . for the brilliance of casting tommy lee jones , i award it * and recommend you neither see nor rent this movie . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"about the nicest thing i can say about a steven seagal film is that the average offering from the man who personifies wooden acting is more entertaining than sitting in traffic . fire down below , seagal's latest ( which seems just like his next-to-latest ) , is just about average . it offers what seagal fans have come to expect from their icon : a healthy dose of ego and a lot of fights in which no one ever lays a finger on the star . it's a known fact that the more violent a seagal movie is , the more enjoyable it is . to that end , fire down below could have used a few more fight scenes to cut down on such unimportant irritants as the laughable attempts at plot and character development . let me say up front that i believe seagal to be totally sincere in his concern for the environment , but it strikes me that preaching about it in an action film is not the best arena . it's not only a distraction , but it comes across as both sanctimonious and hypocritical . ( it's okay for seagal to beat the crap out of anyone who looks cross-eyed at him , but don't you dare dump that glowing green stuff down a mine shaft ! ) his means -- any and all necessary , and the more violent , the better . there's also an obligatory love interest , played with a distinct lack of enthusiasm by marg helgenberger , and a dull sidekick who is listlessly essayed by the normally-reliable harry dean stanton . seagal must demand that actors in his films discard any inherent talent so there's no threat of stealing scenes from him . however , by including an incest subplot and creating so many idiotic , cartoonish villains for seagal to beat up , it actually reinforces the unflattering image . at one point , taggart makes a comment about possibly coming to live in the area . i think we're supposed to infer that he's in awe of the beauty of the appalachians , but it seems more likely that he has been seduced by the thought of so many readily-available punching bags . the action scenes are adequately directed ( by felix enriquez alcala , a tv director making the crossover to feature films ) , and there's a genuinely tense truck-and-car chase that is worth about 90 seconds of moderate excitement . the rest of the film is all by-the-book stuff , but that's what's expected whenever the name  steven seagal  tops the marquee .  the cinema is not an art which films life : the cinema is something between art and life . unlike painting and literature , the cinema both gives to life and takes from it . . .  - jean-luc godard ",0,1.0,0.0,1.2757436920599999e-61
"anyone going to spawn who is unaware of the film's origins will quickly determine that this is the descendent of a comic book . in addition to focusing on the exploits of a superhero ( albeit an atypical one ) , spawn possesses the distinctive style and visual flair of a comic book-turned-motion picture ( see the crow , batman , and darkman for other recent examples ) . unfortunately , where the movie falls apart is in the storyline . while spawn fans may be delighted by this effort , the uninitiated may have a hard time getting beyond the fancy special effects and often-incoherent plot . in a very palpable way , spawn is much like another of this summer's big budget releases , the fifth element . both movies belong in the  style over substance  category , both present interesting visual packages , and both are less than satisfying . to succeed as a major motion picture , spawn has to appeal to those who do not regularly plunk down $2 for the comic book ; this motion picture is a poor step in that direction . spawn's underlying premise is , at its most basic , a twist on faust . as outlandish as this background may sound , it wouldn't be that hard to accept if it fueled a strong story . unfortunately , spawn's plot isn't especially interesting or engrossing . the film , helmed by first- time director and former ilm veteran mark dippe , gets bogged down by digital effects , many of which appear a little too artificial . these are the kinds of shots that look great on a computer screen , but aren't nearly as impressive in a movie theater ( compare them to the fine work at the beginning of contact ) . in the end , a great deal more effort seems to have been put into the look of the film than into the story . as disappointing as spawn will be to anyone expecting a strong story , there are a few things to like about the film . first and foremost , the kinetic style disallows the possibility of boredom . then there's john leguizamo's delightfully off the wall rendering of the wisecracking clown , who looks and acts like a cross between jim carrey's riddler and jabba the hut . michael jai white's performance as the lead character is hampered by his mask , makeup , and costume . martin sheen , theresa randle , and d . b . what the studio fails to recognize , however , is that this sort of  dark hero  approach is nothing new . darkman and the crow have already explored it in some detail , while movies like batman and the shadow have embraced certain aspects of it . in fact , an analysis of spawn reveals that this production is basically an amalgamation of scenes , setups , characters , and situations from other , often better motion pictures . essentially , spawn does for comic books what stargate did for science fiction : it borrows liberally ( or steals , depending on your perspective ) . what works on the printed page does not necessarily translate well to the screen . as a comic book , spawn may be first rate , but , as a movie , it's a retread .

"the late stanley kubrick had a gift for laying raw our emotions in a way that could make us quite uncomfortable as we examine our normally suppressed feelings . in other films like dr . strangelove and full metal jacket , the subject was militaristic patriotism . in eyes wide shut , writer and director kubrick tackles a subject , sexuality , which american audiences aren't used to considering seriously . although films like there's something about mary and american pie use sex for comedic purposes and x-rated films are available for explicit sexual fantasies , most movies avoid any serious treatment of sexuality . americans , after all , are quite comfortable with movie murder but much less so with cinematic sex . this scene is an omen and arguably the key one in the movie , for it poses the question of whether such risky sexual activities are worth it , even if the price is devastatingly high . when he's propositioned by a friendly streetwalker , he accompanies her home , not quite sure if he thinks this is a good idea or not . in a movie that's surprisingly funny at times , the hooker needs him to place his order .  what do you want to do ?   what do you recommend ?  he finally asks as he would of the sommelier when choosing just the right wine at one of the fancy restaurants he frequents . ( the brief orgy scene is the one in which american audiences are  spared  the embarrassment of seeing intercourse . we have digital fig leaves in the form of extra bodies inserted in front of some of the obviously copulating couples . these few seconds of changes keep the movie from getting an nc-17 . the rest of the world gets the director's cut . if the characters had committed murder instead of sex , no cover-up would have been required . ) as has been widely reported , kidman's performance is stellar and will undoubtedly get her at least a nomination for an oscar . her acting stays right on the edge . cruise's acting is no less impressive . larry smith's oversaturated , grainy cinematography depicts well the grime that has entered the characters' heretofore-spotless life . jocelyn pook's loud , staccato piano score for the film reminds us of bill's fear and panic , as if we can hear his heart beating out of his chest . the rich picture leaves us with so much left to discuss , the film's many religious allusions being just one topic out of many .  it always does . until it doesn't . but you know that , don't you ?  what will happen next is undoubtedly much more complex than the last scene implies . in this movie , to which there will most certainly not be a sequel , it is left to audiences to decide the fate of the tragic couple . in a film that revels in its ambiguity , the ending is the most intriguingly ambiguous of all . the best filmmakers provide the best questions , not the easiest answers . it is in the not-quite-resolved conclusion that this film serves as a fitting tribute to kubrick's legacy . it is rated r for strong sexual content , nudity , language and some drug-related material and would be fine for teenagers only if they are older and mature .

"screenplay : lowell ganz & babaloo mandell . director : ron howard . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 118 minutes . you'd think that the makers of edtv could take comfort in critic roger ebert's dictum that  a movie isn't about what it's about , it's _how_ it's about what it's about .  edtv , the filmmakers could argue , is about some of those same themes in a different way . sure , like the truman show it's about a man's life turned into 24-hour entertainment , but director ron howard could still make the claim that edtv is unique . and he'd be right , for all the worst possible reasons . edtv is a shallow and jokey rendering of its subject , a toothless satire that fades before the last punchline . hard to say , since we're not exactly to privvy to what ed's values were in the first place . the closest lowell ganz & babaloo mandel's script comes to defining ed is suggesting that he's basically a lazy simpleton who figures he can hit the big time by becoming a celebrity without doing any actual work . trouble is , that kind of personality wouldn't instantly endear ed either to his televsion audience or to us , so instead he's made a nice-guy rascal who scratches himself jes' like reg'lar folks . in short , he's a bore , as the subject of a television show and the subject of a feature film . even with a lackluster leading man , edtv might have worked if there had been any spark to its satire . how very bizarre to watch it instead morph into a kind of a meta-commentary on its own mass media sentibilities . as  edtv  becomes a phenomenon , we watch a parade of celebrities offer cameo commentary on ed-mania : ariana huffington , george plimpton , filmmaker michael moore , jay leno , bill maher , etc . edtv often aims to score points simply by trotting out famous faces , then finds no irony in a film about fame-for-fame's-sake which includes zingers from rupaul . even the endless series of advertisements on  edtv  feels more self-serving than sardonic ; aside from the clever use of a trojans ad during one of ed's romantic trysts , they feel like someone trying to have his product placement cake and eat it too . edtv still manages to be sporadically amusing , thanks largely to the gag-meister sit-com style of ganz and mandel . martin landau turns in a sharp supporting performance as ed's wheelchair-bound stepfather , and howard comes up with a couple of nicely-observed touches like the viewing parties that pop up around ed's first on-air sex . in general , though , ron howard is a sentimentalist with about as much edginess as a teletubbie . he's more interested in making edtv a fairly generic romanctic comedy than in digging into the reasons behind americans' video voyeurism , or examining how , in a post-modernist twist , our awareness of  reality  television has made reality just as staged as drama . in the end , edtv really is about the subject of mass media in its own way . it's about how much easier it is to let the viewers feel good than it is to tell them what they need to hear . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject  subscribe  .

"perspective is a curious matter . sometimes , a thing is entirely how you look at it rather than the thing itself . even in the mind , style can triumph over substance . there is an abundance of style on display in three seasons , enough to cloak its lapses in substance . the narrative consists of four largely independent stories of life in modern saigon . visually , three seasons is a remarkably assured piece of film-making , using the contrasts of ancient , war-time and modern vietnam to perfection . cinematographer lisa rinzler captures flower-showered streets and lotus gardens with a warm glow , helping make three seasons an often enchanting tone poem on the conflicts inherent in introducing the contemporary into the conventional . as a narrative , it's considerably more inconsistent , as one might expect from the multiple independent story-lines . by far the most effective is the tale of cyclo driver hai , given the strongest emotional and thematic pull by don duong's exceptional performance . at its core his is a tried-and-true hooker with a heart of gold story , yet something in duong's manner makes the cliche more resonant , his attempts to  save  lan more ennobling than predictable . each of the other tales has its moments , but they come more sporadically . keitel's american perspective feels particularly intrusive , almost like a sop to american audiences ; what's more , it adds a title-confounding fourth story to the three seasons . though three seasons rarely inspires seat-shifting , it's never as engaging as it is when the focus is on hai . still , the stories do ultimately come together as tales of healing , of reconciling vietnam's troubled past with its challenging present and future . as the first american production shot in vietnam since the war , it's also an often-compelling cultural document . there's little doubt that three seasons feels somehow more  significant  because it is so gracefully and beautifully composed , but that's hardly a cause for consternation . if it pushes plenty of the right aesthetic buttons , that only proves that glamour can change one's perspective , as it clearly has in a post-war saigon where coke adds life . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject  subscribe  .

"director : lynne stopkewich . mpaa rating : unrated ( sexual situations , nudity , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 78 minutes . canada's david cronenberg has already delivered one exploration of the bond between carnality and mortality in 1997 , the much-talked-about crash , and now countrywoman lynne stopkewich has presented us with kissed . her narration is surprisingly effective at explaining the reasons for and the impact of sandra's actions , and molly parker plays sandra as a decent , focused young woman who understands how her necrophilia is viewed by others . stopkewich gives matt an enigmatic history -- he's a medical student who is taking time off for an unexplained reason -- and outerbridge gives a painful conviction to his growing frustration with his inability to satisfy sandra . sandra has come to terms with her unique needs , and it is to stopkewich's credit that sandra is portrayed as someone with compassion rather than as a twisted fiend . the arc of the story may be fairly predictable , but that story is skillfully constructed to make the fate of the characters matter . there is an unexpected warmth to kissed . being canadian doesn't mean you have to turn sex -- even sex with a corpse -- into something cold and emotionless .

"a satirical film where warren beatty tries to talk the black man's rap to get across his political message : which is that there's something wrong in politics that corrupts everyone in it . maybe he does this because he feels relieved that he's going to die soon . this is an awkardly embarrassing scene , that was more embarrassing than funny to watch beatty try to ingratiate himself this way to his black brothers . it reminded me in an analogous way of the liberals in the '60s who invited the black panthers into their wealthy homes and thought they were so chic . even frank capra wasn't that schmaltzy . the story gets too ridiculous at this point to even be satirical or credible , it is just bad filmmaking ; but it does try in its unclear and scrambled way to blame the media and the rich people who control it , for not being risk takers and offering fresh arguments into the political fray . amiri baraka ( poet & playwright ) , supposedly a voice of consciousness , plays a homeless wiseman who keeps popping up from scene-to-scene , uttering this heavy stream of consciousness rap ,  we need no more ghosts , we need a spirit .  the fault of the film , is that beatty can't gracefully pull off what he is trying to accomplish without appearing to be smug about it , like he's the white man who knows best what to do , and that anything he does is super cool because he really cares about the blacks and the poor ( sic ) . everyone in the film is a cardboard prop for beatty to lay it into them with his political cliches . just when i thought wag the dog was the stupidest political comedy i ever saw , along comes this sophomoric venture , showing no plausible way of replacing the old lies of senator bulworth with his new so-called truths , and as a result it is a film that out wags the dog's tail in silliness and prattle , unable to have the demented bulworth say what he would do when elected , except what is implied , that the people will trust him because he's so hip and daring , and he's just so with it . there was a smugness about this film that made its childish political voice seem more annoying than it should be , even taking away any enjoyment that might have been derived from its comic efforts . beatty is just not the filmmaker i would want telling my side of the story . all he has done is make a film that is cliched and overbearing and funny in a not funny way , and he sounds no different or trustworthy than the politicians he features in the film , clinton and dole . and , i don't mean that as a compliment .

"mike nichols , the director of such well-received films as the graduate and working girl , has taken the outrageous 1978 french farce , la cage aux folles , and , by tweaking , updating , and americanizing it , come up with a huge winner . the birdcage , as it's called , is one of those rare motion pictures with side-splitting laughs where the humor never stays dormant for long . using the talents of choreographers and set designers who don't know the meaning of  moderation  , this movie is a triumph of the stylistically absurd . but , as flashy and splashy as the man-dressed-as-a-woman scenario can be , the birdcage ( like priscilla ) is as much about being gay as it is about transvestitism , and it advances a message of equality , love , and acceptance .  we are family  isn't just the film's opening number ; it's the theme song . but things are no longer normal . the result of this , as might be expected , is a hilarious disaster . although most of the jokes come from elaine may's screenplay , it's the performances that make them funny . robin williams , despite his reputation for unfettered mania , is surprisingly restrained throughout most of the birdcage , doing a little serious acting along the way . williams and lane work well as a couple , feeding off one another in the fashion of all great comedy twosomes . gene hackman has the straight man's role , and he fits into it wonderfully . his antics to escape reporters and his reaction to val's parents are two of the film's comic highlights . the only one who's too over-the-top is hank azania as armand and albert's houseboy , aggedor . his exaggerated mannerisms are frequently as irritating as they are amusing . the birdcage rivals a midwinter's tale for the funniest movie released thus far in 1996 . in fact , the film is so boisterously entertaining that it's easy for the unsuspecting viewer not to realize that there's a message here . the structure of the birdcage is designed to show us that there isn't much difference between conservatives and liberals or straight and gay people . nichols' picture preaches tolerance and understanding , but neatly camouflages such themes beneath gaudy sets , colorful costumes , and unrestrained humor . the script has a few lulls , and there are times when it doesn't make a lot of sense , but there are few better ways to spend a chilly winter evening than peering through the bars of the birdcage .

"cast : jenny agutter , lucien john , david gumpilil director : nicolas roeg producers : si litvinoff screenplay : edward bond from the novel by james vance marshall cinematography : nicolas roeg music : john barry u . s . distributor : films inc . the film , which had five minutes of jenny agutter's frontal nudity cut from its original u . s . release , was never transferred to video . as a result , this is the first opportunity for the under-30 crowd to experience the film , and the first chance for north american movie-goers of any age to see the entire , uncensored version . ( incidentally , by today's standards , the nude scenes of agutter wouldn't earn anything more sensational than an  r  . ) it's clear here , as it was in many '70s pictures , that civilized humanity is the enemy -- the scourge and rapist of nature . by today's standards , the film's message may seem a little naive , but that by no means renders it invalid . there are biblical allusions as well , such as snakes in a tiny desert oasis , but the real serpent in this eden is the industrialized society . for the most part , walkabout is an involving , occasionally hypnotic , motion picture . some of the photography , including images of the outback and its denizens , is spectacular . there are also several effective visual contrasts between man and nature , such as the sequence where agutter's character , a child of civilization , is enjoying a quiet swim in a natural pool while a group of aborigines , children of the wilderness , are curiously exploring the burnt-out shell of a car . all throughout the film , the differences between man and his world are highlighted , and the ending , which , while tragic , seems almost inevitable . not every aspect of walkabout is successful , however . roeg occasionally resorts to intrusive camera tricks to get his point across , and , without exception , these work to the film's detriment . the use of still frames , hand-held shots , and bizarre inserts interferes with the simple beauty of the film , temporarily distancing the viewer from what's transpiring . these supposedly-artistic riffs are uniformly more distracting than effective . certainly , the most fascinating aspect of walkabout is the relationship between the white children and their black guide . not so for agutter's character , a wild flower wilting under the relentless sun . there's a subtle element of sexual tension in their relationship , but it's kept in the subtext . i doubt any film made today would be as oblique about this . the climactic moment , and the different ways the three characters face it , says more about the contrast between the  civilized  and  uncivilized  than anything else in the film . it's difficult for me , reviewing walkabout more than a quarter century after its initial release , to get a sense of what the movie meant then , when its method and approach were fresher and more unique than they appear now . by 1997 , we've seen innumerable films with the same message , and that makes parts of walkabout appear outdated . nevertheless , even considering that this motion picture has not aged as well as some other landmark '70s movies , certain aspects of the film -- notably its lush , evocative photography and forceful emotional component -- make it a worthwhile experience for a '90s audience .

"there was a time during the long history of the adult entertainment industry that porn films showed signs of artistic ambition . during the late '70s , a small cadre of directors believed that they could combine the raunch of real sex with an involving plot . it was a lofty goal , and one that ultimately proved impossible to realize , especially with the advent of video forcing movies to be made cheaper and faster . but boogie nights isn't just an expose of the porn industry -- it's a provocative and involving character study , as well . while it could be argued that anderson has bitten off more than he can chew -- a few too many of the men and women populating his film are left half-developed -- an overambitious approach is always preferable to the alternative , and boogie nights does enough things right that it's easy to overlook its few shortcomings . one of the movie's greatest , and most immediately obvious , assets is its ability to capture the feel and mood of the late '70s and early '80s . at different times throughout the film , anderson uses long , single takes where the camera pans from one character to another , putting the viewer in the midst of a swirl of activity . the director also has a talent for picking just the right songs for each scene , making the soundtrack an integral part of the movie rather than just a jumbled collection of old disco hits . add to that the hairdos , clothing , decor , and attitudes of the era , and you have an effective re- creation of recent history . the first half of the film , which takes place between 1977 and late 1979 , is lively and energetic , with the focus on parties and good times . then , following a pivotal sequence at a 1979/80 new year's eve gathering , boogie nights' tone shifts to something more grim and contentious . the porn industry goes into a downward spiral with mass-market video supplanting carefully-made movies , and the actors and directors are sucked down with it . together , the director and his star seek to elevate the adult film to the next level ( which actually resembles a cheap exploitation action flick ) . dirk isn't the only one under jack's wing . although mark wahlberg has the starring role , and gives the best performance of his still-young career ( although there are still times when he is stiff ) , he is easily overshadowed by two more impressive portrayals . matching reynolds' performance step-by-step is julianne moore , who can add her role in boogie nights to an ever-increasing list of interesting and challenging characters . and porn icon nina hartley gets some mainstream exposure , and even a few lines , as little bill's wife . boogie nights is filled with so many subplots and secondary themes that it would be impossible to recount them all here . all of the men and women populating boogie nights encounter at least one of these elements as they traverse their character arc . boogie nights is a dramatically rich and visually arresting motion picture that has earned ( and is deserving of ) comparisons to the films of robert altman . anderson takes risks with this movie , few of which fall short . ( one of these is the pointed and sure-to-be controversial final shot -- a perfectly conceived and framed statement about the de-humanizing effects of the porn industry . ) the result is a memorably penetrating motion picture .  the cinema is not an art which films life : the cinema is something between art and life . unlike painting and literature , the cinema both gives to life and takes from it . . .  - jean-luc godard ",1,0.0,1.0,3.1466769776199995e-27

"screenplay : jack bernstein , tom shadyac & jim carrey . director : tom shadyac . as many individual elements as i might analyze with any given film , my gut reaction almost always comes down to one crucial issue : did the film do what it was trying to do ? if it was a thriller , did it keep me in suspense ? if it was a romance , did i respond emotionally ? and if it was a comedy , did i laugh ? of all the film types , comedy is perhaps the most difficult to analyze ; either it works , or it doesn't . which brings me to this confession : i laughed at ace ventura : pet detective . god help me , i laughed quite a bit . comedian jim carrey's unique persona won me over in spite of a great deal of stupidity and some sluggish pacing . vanity projects are a dime a dozen these days , but they all apply a very similar logic , namely that if you let the star do what he or she does best , and if that star's audience is large enough , you'll have a success . i'm not sure whether the latter condition is true of carrey , but it is true that he's allowed to do what he does best . it has been a long time since i've seen a physical comedian who looks as comfortable on screen as carrey . his elastic features recall early jerry lewis , while his spindly frame and geeky self- confidence show traces of pee-wee herman . when the comedy is purely physical , the laughs are really big . the opening sequence features ace disguised as a parcel deliveryman gleefully shattering the contents of his package to simulate a shipping mishap . ace ventura boasts some of the most amusing slapstick in recent years this side of the zucker-abrahams-zucker films . it's considerably more erratic in its success when it comes to verbal gags . in fact , ace ventura is almost self-congratulatory in its political incorrectness , using homophobia and sexism as punch lines . the film drags between visual set pieces , rescued only by carrey's goofy delivery . part of the problem is that screenwriters carrey , tom shadyac and jack bernstein frequently seem unclear as to when enough is enough . ace's trademark mocking cackle , borrowed from carrey's fire marshall bill character from  in living color ,  is funny once but not three times . a more telling example involves the theme song from the crying game , used perfectly once but then used again so that it just seems derivative . finally , one piece of advice for filmmakers : if you must use dan marino for a cameo , please don't give him too many lines . an isotoner glove commercial is about all i can take . there would seem to be little point to commenting on the supporting players in ace ventura , since for all practical purposes they serve as scenery with sag cards . she has a fun , over-the-top part much like her role in fatal instinct , but wisely she avoids trying to steal scenes from carrey . it just wouldn't work . in ace ventura , jim carrey establishes himself as a first-rate screen clown , one i hope to see again .

( actually , the fact that the movie was made in slovakia probably has something to do with the error . ) there's certainly nothing in here that's likely to jolt anyone , and even the typical , cheesy scares offered by low-budget horror flicks are ruined by pyun's heavy-handed direction . if anything , even at only seventy-five minutes in length , the movie is more apt to put viewers to sleep than keep them awake . the tired premise , which uses a recycled post-apocalyptic scenario , involves a bizarre psycho mutant killer on the loose in 2007 boston . of course , this is all background . this chase , which generates absolutely no tension , comprises the entire movie . there are no tangents , interesting variations , or anything else to break the monotony . in fact , there's not even much dialogue , and what little there is makes the tripe from sylvester stallone's daylight seem like shakespeare . attention to detail is not exactly adrenalin's forte , either . other characters are still around , alive and kicking , after getting riddled with about a dozen bullets . if i tried to list all the holes , inconsistencies , and other obvious problems with this movie , it would take me the rest of the week to write this review . a few words have to be said about this particular bizarre psycho mutant killer , who is perhaps the most lame bizarre psycho mutant killer ever to grace the big screen . this guy looks like quasimodo on a bad day .  awful  doesn't even begin to describe the makeup job ; disney's recent hunchback looked better , and he was a cartoon . of course , considering the intelligence ( or lack thereof ) of the characters we're exposed to , maybe that's not such a farfetched concept . i realize that aficionados of this genre don't expect much from their films , but adrenalin takes ineptness to new levels . christopher lambert fans ( are there such people ? ) natasha henstridge fans will probably be equally disappointed , since , unlike in species , she keeps all her clothes on . in fact , i'm hard-pressed to think of anyone who will appreciate this movie , unless it's someone who adores really , really bad movies . thus far , 1996 hasn't given us anything else that's in adrenalin's category . hands down , i nominate this as the worst movie of the year .

"what is going on inside her , is seen through the marvelously constructed dream sequences of her in africa- as a griot , an african musical storyteller , chants out an indecipherable medley of very potent songs- that are very emotionally received by her . this is the kind of filmmaking bertolucci does best . there is an element of vague beauty and mystery in these sequences that evoke a sense of wonder . strangely enough , their past seems to be becoming more and more inconsequential . the imponderable emotions of love are caught in the music , the stunning visual spectacle of the film , and in the quietude of their personalities . how this works out , is how hard to say . it wasn't easy for me to be sure if love meant the same thing for both of them . the glib ending didn't help me understand them any better , as it felt like something was missing from their relationship , something that either i didn't catch or something that was just left out of their relationship that shouldn't have been . their acting was first-rate and very unnerving , we could see their thinking and emotional process unfolding on screen ; it is ultimately what makes this film somewhat special . the up and down career of bertolucci , is up again after this less than epic film ( actually made for an hour tv program , but lengthened for the sake of a feature movie ) . it is the kind of small art story that bertolucci seems to excel in more than with some of his more recent commercial ventures ( little buddha , the last emperor ) . that even though this story was an obvious and abbreviated one , it was still a joy to see . what the story means , is not tied in with some of the director's political or psychological ideas of the past . this is more or less a film that lives through its style and grace of letting the two of them tell their story without much help from the script . and it worked out better than these kind of films usually do , mainly because there is a power in bertolucci's direction that maybe someday he can put it all together and live up to the potential that was once expected of him . all his films are worth looking at , and this one more so than what i have seen in a long time from him . it sort of grows on you , and seems more emotionally satisfying the more you think about it .

"praise for the indian director , who died in 1992 shortly after receiving a lifetime achievement oscar , has been effusive from both film makers and critics . and james ivory , the director of howards end and the remains of the day , has said that , after watching a ray movie , the viewer will feel  fulfilled , enriched , maybe wiser , and wanting more .  indeed , it is ivory , along with his partner , ismail merchant , who has made this screening of pather panchali , ray's directorial debut , possible . the movies , which exist on video but are not readily available , are worth searching out . anyone who believes in the uplifting power of motion pictures will not be disappointed . ray takes the time to create a meticulously believable world that draws the viewer in . there isn't a false note in the entire film -- not in the characterization , the dialogue , or the storyline . the emotions evoked by the events of pather panchali are honest and true , not the contrived byproducts of manipulative formulas . ray makes us feel with the characters , not just for them . most of what transpires is shown through the eyes of either sarbojaya or durga , and , as a result , we identify most closely with these two . harihar is absent for more than half of the movie , and , before the penultimate scene , abu is a mere witness to events , rather than a participant . until the closing moments , we don't get a sense of the young boy as a fully formed individual , since he's always in someone else's shadow . with its often-poetic black-and-white images and heartfelt method of storytelling , pather panchali speaks intimately to each member of the audience . this tale , as crafted by ray , touches the souls and minds of viewers , transcending cultural and linguistic barriers . the languorous pace , which initially seems detrimental , proves to be an asset -- pather panchali would not have been the same experience had material been cut . this is the kind of motion picture that will stay with you for hours , or perhaps even days , after you've left the theater , and that's a rare characteristic for any movie .

"this film has a different look to it , as its color tones are strikingly in browns and soft yellows . they added a touch of black humor . ripstein also has a dizzying amount of extra shots of things that don't play exactly into the story but add some arty points he's trying to make about the outside influences facing the alienated julia . i wasn't enlightened by these unnecessary scenes , in fact i thought they were pretentious . almost the entire film is a boring rant by julia , where a fine actress like arcelia ramirez just over acted and failed to bring the audience over to her side . her classical story didn't play like great drama , but felt more like soap opera or a tragic headline newspaper story one reads these days of a mother snapping and killing her children for no logical reason . all the drama evaporated from this presentation , as the film's reward seemed to be a visual feast of looking at the interior of an apartment situated in an ugly apartment building's courtyard . yet this film shouldn't be totally ignored , as the auteur director took chances with this story and was technically innovative as he gave the film a different look to it . that alone should earn him applause for the effort made . at least , his film wasn't stale as most commercial ventures are today . the overriding fault for this art-house film was that it is not poetic in a story that must be poetic to be felt as drama and not soap opera . it unfortunately comes off as too distant ( it's lost in the mundane world for the answers to julia's problems ) for the viewer to empathize with julia's internal misery . it also suffers from comparison to other medea presentations--so many great versions of it were put on as plays , plus the film versions by pasolini and von trier were far superior .

"mute witness is a hitchcockian film that tests the limits of good taste , but nevertheless is a real treat if you can appreciate strange , off-beat movies . i predict many people will be turned off by it and a fair number will walk out , but i was surprised at how much i thoroughly enjoyed it . mute witness tells the story of an american film company shooting a low budget picture in moscow . the central premise of the movie is that billy accidentally witnesses a porn film being made by sergei karlenkov where the actress in it is actually stabbed and murdered . despite its frequent crudeness , mute witness works for two reasons . first , you keep being tricked on what is real , and what is fake ; who are the bad guys and who are the good . second , first time movie actress mary sudina gives a compelling performance . when she is in danger , it feels real and her performance makes you sincerely care for her character . i hope to see sudina in many more films since she has a lot of talent . anthony waller is a first time director and writer who is innovative , shocking , and involving . assuming you do not get turned off by the psycho style violence and leave immediately , you will find yourself being drawn into the complex web of the story . the movie is like a one of those paper mazes where you are trying to help billy find her way out to a safe spot without moving her into one of the many squares where she will be killed . waller has seen and learned from many of hitchcock's best movies . another complication is that billy can hear fine , but the people who may or may not be bad guys speak in russian , and she can not understand a word they say . the special effects are simple but effective . is that supposed to be real blood or fake , a real gun shot or a blank ? the cinematography by egon werdin , the editing by peter r . adam , and the camera work also by director/writer waller use many dramatic cuts . one minute we are watching a scene where someone is being stabbing with the blood ( or is it really blood ? ) spurting to a scene of rare meat in a restaurant being sliced . vegetarianism may find many converts from the people who see this film . there are many little treats in the show . for one the dialog is frequently quiet funny without any traces of being slapstick . i refuse to give away his identity , but i did read that he made the scenes ten years ago when the director first had the idea for the movie . the director just keep the scenes in the film canister . if you see the movie , you will recognize him . just as soon as you think you know what is real and what isn't , you find out you don't , and this confusing state keeps iterating until finally the truth is revealed . whew . it is rated r for sex , nudity , and lots of blood . i found the blood a little shocking but not overdone , nevertheless , i think the film borders on being nc-17 and is not appropriate for teenagers . if you feel like something out of the ordinary , and you like mysteries , i recommend mute witness to you . it was a * * * movie for me . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"joel schumacher's modestly budgeted , gritty looking war melodrama had nothing relevant to say , only saying things that have been said in countless other vietnam war films . the clich ? d hero and the formulaic story never caught my fancy , no matter how much the director tried to make things happen . it's in the style of the first half of full metal jacket , but without the same impact . it's the tale of a soldier who won't conform to the army and by the film's end proves he's not a bad guy and can also be an excellent soldier if he wants to . there were just no surprises forthcoming , as the film seemed to be marking time until it shows him as a leader and proves himself heroic . i think that schumacher thinks because he has no stars and shot this one in a grainy 16-millimeter with a jumpy hand-held camera and with mostly natural light in dogme style , that he caught something cinema v ? rit ? . what goes with schumacher wherever , is a lot of corn . this film is just as weak in storyline as was his big commercial flick batman . what this film has going for it , is some good shots of the swampland in fort polk , louisiana , and some good performances . the movie moves along as if it were on a forced march to hanoi . there's also some liberal claptrap thrown into the storyline , which is unconvincingly done about a racist sociopath . the film heads toward its less than 'big bang' finale in tigerland with the same forced messages about war that could not only chase sluts out of a hotel room but drive film critics to the theater's popcorn vender rather than sit through this torture in its entirety . the director must receive credit for at least getting together a good cast , though i would have loved to see this one with a ed wood jr . cast .

"there's not one character in this film that i felt anything for even though , i'm led to believe , i was supposed to . the film foolhardedly evokes dostoyevsky's  crime and punishment  as the inspiration behind this contemporary film about teen-age angst , yet leaves one with little to remind them of that except for the title . it's a story about outsiders who use violence to get what they want , as all the characters are severely dysfunctional and act goofy to make sure we know how screwed-up they are at all times . the question asked in all seriousness to sum up the film is too trivial to dignify with a serious response as it states even when a good person kills a bad person , it's still a tragedy . i don't see what's the big revelation about that , since i don't know of any sane person who doesn't realize that killing someone is a pretty serious thing . my other problem was i didn't know who was good , i just saw who was more vulnerable . i think it's rather pretentious and arbitrary to think this piece of pulp nonsense had caught the profound themes of the master russian writer . what it caught was a sleazy and exploitive look at a teen-age wasteland , and added nothing relevant to our understanding of such empty lives . that just has nothing to do with what dostoyevsky was getting at , it's just the typical trash seen in countless exploitive films . this unpleasant script by larry gross , seems to be vacuous and more annoying than anything intellectual it presents . it's a b-film that somehow thinks it could get over as an art film for the disenfranchised . when she said that , it came out of the blue and made absolutely no sense . i don't know what she found , but if she calls what she found love--then she lost me . this is one twisted pic . made all the worst because there's no fun in this nonsense uncovered . but the subject matter here is ripe for a steckler flick , as it's a shame the film wasted so much good photography techniques and good background music and some good acting improvisations on such an empty story . this film was released a year after the similar  american beauty ,  even though it was made earlier . it therefore also suffers from being thought of as a copy of that film , even though it wasn't .

"accompanying the press materials for curdled were a few newspaper and magazine articles about actual services which clean up violent crime scenes , services like the one which is a key part of the film's premise . if you want a sure sign of an insecure rookie film-maker , that would be it . i suppose the idea is to impress upon us the real-world foundation of the story , but i simply don't care ; an adept film-maker can sell me his premise over the course of his film . what the articles really tell me is that director and co-writer reb braddock found the concept for curdled in real life , and what the rest of the film tells me is that he didn't quite know what to do with it . for a while , curdled is perversely interesting simply because gabriela is such a unique character . she understands enough to know that other people will not consider her obsession normal , but her enthusiasm makes it difficult for her to contain herself , making for some uncomfortable moments with a potential romantic interest ( bruce ramsay ) and with her co-workers . the black humor in the script by braddock and john maass comes from watching jones' off-beat performance as a woman who shows a wide-eyed glee at being right where dark deeds were done . however , even that bit of character development is subverted for a cheap , easy gag . curdled seems to bounce from realism to surrealism with a capricious indifference . ultimately , this confusion points to a director who does not seem to be in control of his material or his characters . there is a lot going on at various points in curdled , but none of it leads anywhere : the central character doesn't grow , there is no real sub-text about human nature , and there is not even a consistent tone to allow it to work as a cathartic genre picture . it is evident that braddock grabbed on to a basic situation with potential , and that he was able to create an intriguing central character to place in that situation , but that he just didn't know where to go from there . curdled sports a few neat stylistic flourishes , including an eye-catching opening title sequence and a great scene where gabriela does a sensuous dance around a murder scene , but for the most part it is just one big , long , sick joke with a punch line that is not particularly worth the effort . someone should have thought about telling a story , instead of just mailing one .

"starring : whoopi goldberg , mary-louise parker , drew barrymore . screenplay : don roos . i have nothing against that ever-growing sub-genre of american filmmaking known as the  chick flick ;  however , i do have a problem with the idea that women will flock to any slapdash attempt at a sob story , any muddled mess which happens to include female friends , mothers and daughters and truckloads of tragedy . hollywood knows a lot about how to market films to women , but it has done a pretty miserable job of making them . fortunately , boys on the side is that rare creation , an emotional film that actually takes the time to develop characters , although it goes a bit overboard in its third act . the first half of boys on the side is surprisingly funny and effective , thanks largely to three winning performances by goldberg , parker and barrymore . goldberg has coasted quite a bit lately , playing the same hipper-than-thou character with a perpetual furrow in her brow as she deals with dopey white folks , but she is quite good here . parker is a more subtle actress , and she has to be in a role that easily could have become a fussy stereotype ; instead , robin is an extremely sympathetic and appealing character . boys on the side is very funny , but there is more to it than that . in one early scene , robin sprays disinfectant on jane's headphones before using them , and goldberg gives us a  you've got to be kidding  reaction shot . but that moment takes on a different resonance when it is revealed that robin has aids , and might be taking basic precautions . similarly , it is a surprise when jane refuses to hold robin's hand after learning of her illness , since we expect a nearly divine level of understanding from gay characters , but that moment is complicated by the realization that jane might be falling for robin , and that pulling away is just a way of expressing her fear of those emotions . there are numerous surprises like that , both funny and touching , throughout the first half of boys on the side , but the second half is much more uneven . once the women stop in tuscon , much of the film's energy stops with them , and humor inevitably gives way to bathos . most frustrating is a murder sub-plot , which is largely unnecessary and symptomatic of screenwriter don roos' tendency to pile far too much into far too little time . this is a film about the friendships between these three women , and it seriously falters when those friendships are not the focus of the story . when they are the focus , boys on the side does exactly what it sets out to do : it makes you laugh , it makes you sad , and it makes you care .

"obviously there is no such a place as pleasantville , except in a sitcom . pleasantville is a film about how selective one's memory is when it comes to nostalgia , of pining for values that never existed back then but still are the values exemplified for the traditional family , of the resistance to change , and clashes between those in the film who become  colored  and those who remain in  black-and-white ,  and about the need to be an individual and not conform . it's fairly predictable what will happen once the two realize that they are transformed into an unreal tv world , as the film prepares to go into its satire mold and take apart the blandness of such perfection . the filmmaker then analyzes these changes on those newly affected and the result is a more troubled but more interesting people emerging . through special effects from digital processing , flowers start taking on color and the film begins to have a modern-day  alice in wonderland  look to it . j . t . there was something that rubbed me the wrong way about this  cute  idea of a film , besides the fact it was boring and i felt as if i was being lectured to about the obvious general ills of society . there are no radical new ideas presented in this film that will make me really think about these issues any differently than the films of the 1950s would have ; it is as if the filmmaker is saying that 1950s didn't have films that were critical of society : but a list of such films would be very extensive ( marty , high noon , ace in the hole , etc . ) . this snooty attitude , looking down at the past from the vantage point of a supposedly  hip  new age bothered me . afterall , my impression of this film , is that it really is a 1950s sitcom merging with a 1990s  feel good  type of sitcom , and nothing more . it is basically , a gimmicky film , which is the only new ground it breaks , selling an idea about the past that connects it with the present , but doing it at the expense of telling the truth about neither the past or present . the film is trying to say that the innocence of the 1950s must be merged with the social awareness of the 1990s and this can only be accomplished by the teenage heroes , who are not afraid to take chances and change the times they're in . i just didn't buy into this premise and was not convinced that i wasn't seeing anything but a superficial film . character development is a raising of consciousness that comes about only through a real inward awareness , a book can only act as a catalyst for that experience . what is offered movie-wise , is just the kind of empty gestures made to genuine problems , which can be found on tv programs from both yesterday and today . therefore it is just another empty gesture at culture , trying to be cute , letting the baby boomers know that it's okay , there're doing just fine . you can keep being materialists , just be cool about it ! there was no one in this film who understood how to bridge the past with the future , instead this becomes a film just like the sitcoms it parodies , which means it's just another escape film , unable or unwilling to delve deeply into all the real problems it brings up .

"boy , that dates me . it is also an excellent 1960 live action disney movie for the entire family , and it is available on video . it has atmosphere , wild animals , pirates , and most of all , an awe inspiring sense of wonderment about creativity in general and about inventions in particular . director ken annakin fashions an imaginative and special movie . this , of course , is a dead giveaway that this is an old movie . today's screenwriters would only include a mass prayer scene in a film if it was either about a cult and the people in question were all about to commit suicide or about some religious fanatics who were about to be involved in some heinous crime . in this screenplay by ian hay and based on the novel by johann david wyss , the prayer is nothing more than honest worship of their god . the show is fun for the whole family , and it teaches a list of good values so long they are hard to count . don't get me wrong ; this is not one of those pedantic and overly earnest stories where nothing happens , but at least it is completely wholesome . this show is filled with action . they too have a cannon , but only enough powder for a single shot . okay , this may not be realistic , and yet , it shows how imaginative solutions are rewarded . when you see the movie , give it some space and think about the approaches taken and not the plausibility of the actual solutions . this is a kids' movie , remember . in a sweet scene there is a great visual of them using a large turtle to pull them and a lot of cargo from the sinking ship to the shore . watching it , it is hard not to have a warm smile on your face . what a delightful movie you will find yourself thinking . didn't you ever dream of a house in the trees ?  doesn't every kid ? this show continues to speak to the most fundamental aspects of childhood . if watching this show does not kindle some extra interest in creativity in you kids , i'll be surprised . although the video has the colors faded some , the lush cinematography ( harry waxman ) and imaginative sets ( john howell ) are still striking . it is rated g and there is nothing to offend anyone . my son jeffrey , age 7 , loved the picture , but warns that kids under 4 might be scared by the wild animals . i recommend this film to you and your whole family , and i give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"screenplay : cameron crowe . director : cameron crowe . cameron crowe's almost famous -- the writer/director's first film since 1996's jerry maguire -- tallies up its first simple yet thoroughly inspired moment just seconds into the film , during the opening credits . in a cute conceit connected to the story's protagonist , a 15-year-old aspiring music journalist , we see a hand scrawling out the cast on a yellow pad with a pencil . not a line of dialogue had been spoken , and already i was hooked . to crib a line from crowe's last film , almost famous had me at hello . crowe has helmed only four films in his career -- say anything , singles , jerry maguire and now almost famous -- but i'm tempted to call him america's most effortlessly gifted film-maker . there's nothing particularly profound about a coming-of-age story with a rock 'n' roll backdrop , nor does there need to be . crowe isn't a  statement  kind of guy , and it doesn't seem to hurt his films in the least . almost famous simply drops us into the world of rock in the early '70s , and lets us observe through william's wide eyes . like crowe's other films , this one seems to amble along in no particular hurry to get anywhere , giving the characters lots of room to maneuver , yet never feels unfocused or uninvolving . occasionally the loose structure gets in the way , as it does when crowe fails to provide enough foundation for stillwater's burgeoning popularity either through their music or through their performances . far more often , the moment-to-moment experience is too enjoyable for anyone to notice . in large part , that moment-to-moment pleasure comes from crowe's uncanny ability to direct actors . as he has in his previous films , he puts together a solid cast and makes magic . mcdormand , though she remains a too-mannered performer at times , is still entertaining as william's intense mother ; fugit is likeable and innocent in a way that's never bland ; hoffman is yet again is so good you just want to throttle hollywood for not allowing him to be a star . like william , penny only fools herself into thinking it's ever about the music ; though she creates herself as a sort of muse , she's just looking to fill an empty space with rock 'n' roll's mythology of freedom . penny is the story's anchor , and hudson's facial expressions are so perfect they're heartbreaking . as deftly as crowe handles his story , there are still occasional missteps . those tics and a few others like it might have been more damaging in another film , made by another film-maker , but almost famous just seems to absorb its flaws and roll on . there's something almost hypnotic about the grace with which cameron crowe puts a film together , something that produces winner after winner . it's not a life-changing experience , not a clockwork plot or a joke-a-minute script . it's just the pleasure of watching a director who can suck you in with the brush of an eraser . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject  subscribe  .

"screenplay : w . peter iliff . director : mike robbins . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , nudity , adult themes ) running time : 103 minutes . it would also be inaccurate -- religious faithful generally demonstrate some sense of proportion . a cult would be more analagous , with thousands of people connecting their happiness to the achievements of mere mortals to whom greater powers are ascribed . or perhaps rudimentary tribal warfare is more appropriate . or even basic psychological child abuse . or , varsity blues could be made . as the exceedingly pleasant van der beek plays him , there's never much question at all . he's a broad strokes hero like kilmer -- who's not only a martinet , but a racist just for good measure -- is a broad strokes villain . dramatically , mox is a flatline . that inconsequential plot progression wastes plenty of potentially compelling conflict . the emotional center of varsity blues should have been the pressure and twisted values that make high school kids believe nothing they ever do will be as valuable , a sentiment expressed in kilmer's pep talk that the big game is  48 minutes for the next 48 years of your lives .  though director brian robbins ( making a dramatic leap from good burger ) nails the atmosphere of abandoned friday night streets , w . peter iliff's script uses it mostly as scenery for a typical teen soap opera . it's worth noting that robbins and ilif include at least a few insightful scenes -- including one player's rage against how much he's always hated the game -- between the obligatory t&a and party-hearty scenes . this isn't the last picture show we're talking about , nor was it ever likely to be , but it could have aimed for something slightly more ambitious than a climax where all that matters is whether the coyotes can win the big game . that's not just uninspired -- given the setting , it's painfully ironic . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line  subscribe  .

"it's okay for a horror film to be a metaphor ; in fact , they can work best on an underlying psychological level . a scary film can be more than just scary , but it shouldn't work so hard at it that the whole thing becomes a pretentious , preposterous mess . ravenous is just such a convoluted concoction , throwing mountains of sub-text at its tale of cannibalism in the vain hope that something might stick , instead of merely  ick .  every once in a while , when ravenous settles down for some good old-fashioned terror tension , you can almost enjoy it . there are a few nicely staged confrontations and creepy moments in antonia bird's direction ( or perhaps that of milcho manchevski , the director replaced two weeks into production ) , including a sequence involving a sneak attack that builds far longer than you might think possible . writer ted griffin slips a few darkly comic lines into the dialogue , and robert carlyle's manic performance helps support that tone whenever he's on screen . how much more tolerable ravenous might have been if griffin and bird had been content to let the black comedy guide them . instead , it becomes a potpourri of narrative notions and random themes : the dehumanizing destruction of battle ( i . e . , war itself as cannibalism ) , the mad drive for the american frontier ( i . e . , the manifest destiny as cultural/ecological cannibalism ) , the equally mad drive for the gold in them thar hills ( i . e . , the gold rush as economic cannibalism ) , plus yet another gloss on addiction , and on and on to a dizzying degree , with the native american myth of the weendigo thrown in for good measure . boyd's tortured quandary over whether to join this particular diners' club is played as such grand opera , infused with such socio-political baggage , that guy pearce looks like he's carrying the entire weight of western civilization on his shoulders in every scene . no one's saying that the jaunty gruesomeness of eating raoul is the only possible approach for a successful foray into same-species snacking . it may , however , be the best approach . when jeffrey jones is cracking wise while supping on a human stew , ravenous begins to emerge from its coma of self-importance ; when he pleads to be relieved of the misery of his hunger , you wonder when he suddenly developed a character of any significance . at a certain point , ravenous becomes so consumed with putting a heady spin on its subject matter that it consumes itself . a horror film with something to say between shocks is fine . it's rare -- and annoying -- to find one that just won't shut up . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject  subscribe  .

"so what would cause 2 grown women and about 2 dozen grown men to faint ? lest you faint , let me tell you up-front that the same jackie chan plays them both . jackie chan films are endurable and enjoyable only because of the boyish charm and energetic bravado of chan himself . the scripts for his movies are usually so thin that , without jackie chan , it would be almost ridiculous to contemplate going to see them . twin dragons , originally released in 1992 , has just been re-released theatrically without allowing the film to be screened in advance to film critics . this is probably smart marketing since , among the jackie chan films , this one is probably one of the silliest and lamest . if you have not seen his movies before , you might be inclined to shake your head and walk out during the first 10 minutes of this one , as it's quite ludicrous . leaving would be a mistake , although going in the first place is still questionable . once you're there , stick around because jackie , especially in the film's grand finale , gets to perform one amazing martial arts feat after another . the whole movie is little more than a ruse for jackie to show us his martial arts skills in a comedic setting . in this broad parody , boomer fights not 1 , not 2 , not 3 but 20 men at a time and eventually wins just before he seems certain to be beaten completely to a pulp . although his later films are much better , this one does have its moments . the plot , such as it is , concerns the misadventures of mr . ma in hong kong as he is mistaken for boomer , and vice versa . when one sneezes , so does the other . the movie is way over-the-top slapstick , but for jackie's die-hard fans , no movie of his can be too hokey . for most of us , we'd be better off renting one of his later , more polished movies and passing on this re-release . it is rated pg-13 for comedic violence , sexual situations and profanity and would be fine for kids 10 or 11 and up . my son jeffrey , age 10 , found the film confusing , and , although he liked the martial arts , he gave the movie only * 1/2 . his friend steven , age 10 , thought there was a little too much fighting , but liked the comedy enough to give the movie * * 1/2 . his twin , john , thought the movie was really good and worth * * * 1/2 . their friend alan , almost 10 , thought the movie was awesome and was a * * * * motion picture .

"even though it takes place in the 90s , the atmosphere is pure 40s . the dialogue by hilary henkin could have been lifted from any dime store detective story , and it's almost a surprise to see gary oldman sauntering around instead of , say , humphrey bogart . but romeo is bleeding isn't just an homage to the genre , it's a satire as well . unfortunately , it has a tendency to take itself too seriously , which greatly limits its effectiveness . then there's the dialogue , which includes some of the following  classic  lines :  can i tell you what makes love frightening ? it's that you don't own it ; it owns you  ,  whoever you shoot , you might as well marry , because you're tied together with them until the end of life . to the end of either their life , or yours  , and  a life's a life--moral distinctions can paralyze you .  the atmosphere is black-and-white , even though the movie is in color . dariusz wolski's camerawork is evocative , as is the angelo badalamenti-like score by mark isham . unfortunately , the production runs into problems almost from the outset . while gary oldman is an excellent actor , either he's not right for this part , or he's not playing it the way it was meant to be played . his portrayal is unrelentingly grim , which effectively nullifies much of the satirical bent of romeo is bleeding . not only is jack grimaldi unlikable , but he's boring , and certainly not a match for the villainess . lena olin gets the kind of over-the-top , totally nasty role that is normally given to a male actor . her mona demarkov makes sharon stone's basic instinct character look like a girl scout . she's the kind of woman that will laugh while garroting you , take a chainsaw to her own arm , then ask if you want to make love with the prosthesis on or off . ms . olin steals every scene that she's in , although that isn't difficult considering how easily mr . oldman blends into the background . juliette lewis is , plainly put , annoying in what is thankfully a small role . anabella sciorra fares much better as the wife whom grimaldi professes to still love . the voice-over is another problem . it's certainly hardboiled , which is in keeping with the overall tone , but it's also incredibly long-winded and intrusive . it doesn't take long before the viewer begins to wish mr . oldman would just shut up and let the story get moving on its own . comparisons with quentin tarantino's reservoir dogs and true romance are inevitable , but romeo is bleeding comes across as an inferior product . tarantino may operate in the same genre , and with equally bloody scripts , but his characters have greater depth and his stories are more energetic and powerful . without lena olin's performance , romeo is bleeding could have been an ordinary , or even sub-par , film noir . however , with a villainess as fun as mona demarkov , it's impossible not to find some enjoyment amidst gary oldman's dreadful seriousness and all the bloody corpses . there are some plot twists , and a few unexpected happenings , but in the end , it's ms . olin's character that keeps the audience in their seats .

"what is it exactly about jean-claude van damme that is so appealing to hong kong directors ? his refusal to let plot interfere in a stunt ? and what else do the two films have in common ? uninspired situations and action which is unlikely to make anyone forget the director's hong kong efforts . i find myself at something of a loss as i try to come up with something worth saying about maximum risk , because it is such a resolutely mediocre film . it even wastes the presence of natasha henstridge , who may not have proven herself to be a gifted thespian yet but still has nearly as much impressive physicality at her disposal as van damme , and the only use to which it is put is in a nude scene which may re-define gratuitous . the one possible interesting twist -- alain is a military-trained crack shot -- is mysteriously kept under wraps until only ten minutes remain in the film , when suddenly he can shoot an eye out at 200 yards . van damme himself is making gradual strides as an actor , something genre cohorts like steven seagal may never do . the problem is that , through his own decisions or those imposed on him by the hollywood hierarchy , van damme performs in the kind of films where serious acting usually looks just plain silly . alain may be deeply affected by learning of the existence of his twin , but when he is forced to react to that knowledge by throwing yet another roundhouse kick or , worse yet , staring into a metaphorically convenient fractured mirror , it is like van damme is playing at acting rather than really acting . it has a dirty feel which is atypical of glossy hollywood adventures , and a few action sequences have real crackle , particularly the opening chase through the streets of nice . lam clearly has the chops to put the action in an action film , a knack for pacing and an awareness of where a camera should go .

"oliver stone is perhaps best known for his numerous politically- influenced motion pictures -- everything from his vietnam trilogy to jfk and nixon . now , with his latest audacious outing , stone has set his sights on a genre film . the result , called u- turn , is film noir steeped in excess . yet , although stone has clearly made this motion picture with his tongue planted firmly in his cheek , he nevertheless manages to capture all of the tension and mystery necessary to hold the viewer's interest . hence , while stone may be poking a little good-natured fun at the genre , he has also created a highly- successful entry to it . but , although much was different about the way the movie was put together , it still bears many hallmarks of recent stone productions . the excesses of the photographic style hearken back to natural born killers and include black & white inserts , numerous hand-held shots , overexposed sequences , hallucinogenic effects , and time-lapses . i'm not a big fan of this sort of camera trickery , since it seems designed more to show off a director's pretentiousness than to add anything significant to the motion picture . this approach helped sink natural born killers ; fortunately , it's only occasionally distracting here . the narrative twists and turns in a serpentine fashion , rarely proceeding in a predictable or straightforward manner for more than a few minutes at a time ( hence , the title ) . film noir aficionados will recognize and/or expect many of the plot's contortions , since there are various requirements that have to be met by any entry of the genre . however , anticipating certain occurrences doesn't necessarily diminish our enjoyment , and the film takes so many detours that at least one or two of them are bound to surprise even the most jaded movie-goer . film noir is always more plot-conscious than character-focused , and this is pretty much the case here . stone and writer john ridley have populated u-turn with a variety of colorful types , only a few of whom show the beginnings of multi-dimensionality . the best-developed individual is , not surprisingly , the lead . the denizens of superior are a strange lot . penn , one of his generation's best actors , makes bobby into more than just a moody loner . meanwhile , the sultry lopez plays up the ambiguities of her character , so we're never quite sure whether she's a good girl , a bad girl , or something in between . many viewers will recognize echoes of red rock west in u-turn . but , as fun and frantic as red rock west was , u-turn tops it , adding 30 minutes of running time and doubling the number of plot twists . plus , stone's lurid , graphic , in-your-face style is far different from john dahl's homage to '40s and '50s movies . u-turn is definitely not for everyone -- some viewers will find the juxtaposition of offbeat comedy and noir cliches too strange and others will be offended by the film's extreme violence . nevertheless , for those who enjoy movies on the edge , u-turn offers just the trajectory you might expect .  the cinema is not an art which films life : the cinema is something between art and life . unlike painting and literature , the cinema both gives to life and takes from it . . .  - jean-luc godard ",1,2.1825459334999988e-263,0.999999999955,4.5495673221099996e-11

"when one thinks of scandinavian movies , the name of ingmar bergman leaps to mind . the great swedish director's films were almost always austere , beautifully-made , and intellectual ( sometimes to a fault ) . as a result , those whose expectations for junk mail are based on bergman , are in for something of a shock . this movie , the product of norwegian first-time director pal sletaune , owes more to david lynch and denmark's the kingdom than it does to the work of bergman , troell , or any other notable scandinavian film maker . most of the film takes place in the seed , dirty , and dreary backrooms and alleys of oslo , and the characters are like rejects from terry gilliam's brazil . and , although junk mail threads its way through a series of potentially-serious issues , sletaune keeps the tone comical ( albeit darkly so ) . in many ways , this is a strange movie ; i liked it in spite of the characters , who could charitably be called unpleasant losers , and in spite of the grungy atmosphere , which seems to have soaked into the bones of everyone populating the picture . junk mail generated an incredibly strong buzz at last year's toronto film festival ( where i had originally planned to see it ) . instead of faithfully delivering parcels and envelopes to their rightful destinations ( see kevin costner's the postman if you want this kind of mentality ) , he dumps about half of his load so he can spend hours loafing . not surprisingly , the standout performance in junk mail belongs to robert skjaerstad , who manages to make a worm like roy seem believable . >from time-to-time , we actually find ourselves feeling something close to sympathy for him . andrine saether is pleasant as line . per egil aske plays georg as a cross between a conscienceless sociopath and a bumbling idiot . he's deadly , but a little too stupid to be truly frightening . this edgy , entirely original movie succeeds for a couple of reasons : it isn't afraid of breaking the rules ( the lead character is a pathetic loser who never finds redemption ) and it never overexplains itself to the audience . it's a fresh , quirky picture that will appeal to anyone looking for something that , as monty python put it , is completely different . the only real downside is that the conclusion is a little too open-ended to be fully satisfying . up to that point , however , junk mail is an entertainingly offbeat experience . it's unclear whether this will get any kind of widespread u . s . distribution , but it has already become , and will likely continue to be , a film festival favorite .  my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down .  -- david puttnam ",1,1.7610311158399998e-75,0.9403618177140001,0.05963818228619999
"screenplay : mark rosenthal and lawrence konner . director : barry sonnenfeld . michael j . fox is in a * deep * rut . it's a type that has worked for him , thanks to his charm and comic timing , but it puts him in danger of carrying questionable projects which seem comfortable . as a perfect example , witness for love or money , a cliche-filled would-be romantic comedy that's neither particularly romantic nor particularly funny . his specialty is doing that little something extra for the guests--walking their dogs , acquiring hard-to-get theater tickets--and raking in huge tips for his efforts . if you have to guess which choice doug will make , you haven't seen very many romantic comedies . the point is never whether they'll end up together , but simply how entertaining getting there will be . it starts promisingly enough , with a focus on doug's wheeling and dealing , but once the romantic plot kicks in there's just no energy . there's a lengthy sequence at a party involving mistaken identities and doug trying to hold everything together which was frantic but never really clicked ; after that , the film doesn't even seem to try . the situations are simply tedious . i can't begin to describe how tired i am of that stock  we both care about each other but neither one of us will admit it so instead we'll yell at each other  scene in romantic comedies . there are plenty of ways to establish conflict that actually occur in human life ( or perhaps i and everyone i know have just been lucky so far ) . for love or money uses up most of its best jokes and all of its originality in about ten minutes . i also had many problems with the performances . fox has spent so much time as the cocky young go-getter that he doesn't seem to know how to vary it . he also never conveys when the mild flirtation established early in their interaction becomes real romantic interest , but perhaps a better question than  when  is  why .  gabrielle anwar wanders through the film gorgeous but thoroughly uninteresting , emoting and pouting in ways that would make a high school drama teacher cringe . of the supporting players , only michael tucker as a nebbishy hotel guest is not a complete stereotype . particularly embarrassing are fascistic german hotel manager and a swishy fashion designer , but they are just the most glaring examples of a script that makes all the easy choices , and all the wrong ones . director barry sonnenfeld was a marvelous cinematographer ( miller's crossing ) , but so far only a barely serviceable director . like the addams family , for love or money is too ham-fisted , and sonnenfeld's few stylistic flourishes are lost in slow pacing and mishandled actors .

"it takes too much of a suspension of reality to believe in this outlandish plot : the devil is in our heads and was placed there by ordinary contact with others ( it spreads like germs do ) , even though it is played with zeal and candor by denzel washington , who is the squeaky-clean super detective john hobbes . the film is basically a horror film teaser , trying to say something about azazel that it really can't say without sounding ridiculous . there is also heavy use of fuzzy camera images by the cinematographer to indicate that the devil was being photographed from his point of view . these shots of the devil's viewpoint were overworked into the script to the point of overkill . the film worked only on a superficial level , as light entertainment and should be given credit for , at least , attempting to have a literate script . it is basically an escapist film , that failed to build-up tension as the story went on . indeed , by the film's last scene , the story waned in interest , proving mosly that time wasn't on its side . thusly , we have all been duly prepped for the supernatural part of the story to follow . these scenes have a good feel to them as they are grounded in reality and capture the feel of the detective world hobbes inhabits . ms . milano , who conveniently happens to be a professor of theology , tells hobbes ,  if you value your life , if there's even one human being you care about , walk away from this case .  by this time , the story lost its base of reality . the evil spirit that couldn't die moves from person to person , and there is a chase scene in a crowd where the possessed pursuer could be anyone , which was exciting to watch , but added little to the meaning of the story . denzel's noir-like voiceover seemed artificial , an imitation of how a real noir film operates . he was also not convincing as a noir protagonist , he seemed more like a cop who was in a horror movie but might have been better off being in a straight movie about a cop being framed by corrupt cops . the premise of the occult tale was too silly to take seriously . but the film plodded on , getting more ridiculous by the minute , until it ended on a note of surprise , in the twisted manner one expected a film like this to end on .

"cast : toshiro mifune , machiko kyo , masayuki mori , takashi shimura , minoru chiaki , kichijiro ueda director : akira kurosawa producer : jingo minoura screenplay : akira kurosawa and shinobu hashimoto based on the stories  rashomon  and  in a grove  by ryunosuke akutagawa cinematography : kazuo miyagawa music : fumio hayasaka u . s . distributor : r . k . o . it wouldn't be a stretch to name legendary japanese film maker akira kurosawa as one of the ten greatest motion picture directors of all time . kurosawa's brilliant work speaks for itself , and , with over five decades of movie making to his credit , he has more than earned his place alongside the likes of alfred hitchcock , ingmar bergman , martin scorsese , and anyone else who belongs in such lofty company . and , like all of the best directors , kurosawa did not produce his movies with an elite audience in mind . though always intelligent , his body of work plays as well to the  average  movie-goer as it does to the true cineaste . that's the reason why hollywood has plundered kurosawa's pictures on a regular basis . his the seven samurai was remade into one of the greatest westerns ever -- the magnificent seven . and rashomon's unique approach to divergent narratives became a linchpin for courage under fire . rashomon , made in 1950 , was the pair's fifth movie together , and the film that first garnered kurosawa widespread international attention ( it won the 1952 best foreign language film oscar ) . the story told by rashomon is both surprisingly simple and deceptively complex . in each of the four versions of the story , the characters are the same , as are many of the details . but much is different , as well . the only  impartial  witness , the woodcutter , weaves a story that intertwines elements of the other three , leaving the viewer wondering if he truly saw anything at all . many people watch rashomon with the intent of piecing together a picture of what really occured . however , the accounts are so divergent that such an approach seems doomed to futility . rashomon isn't about determining a chronology of what happened in the woods . it's not about culpability or innocence . instead , it focuses on something far more profound and thought-provoking : the inability of any one man to know the truth , no matter how clearly he thinks he sees things . perspective distorts reality and makes the absolute truth unknowable . all of the narrators in rashomon tell compelling and believable stories , but , for a variety of reasons , each of them must be deemed unreliable . it's impossible to determine to what degree their versions are fabrications , and how many discrepancies are the result of legitimate differences in points-of-view . and the impressions of the  impartial  observer further muddy the waters , because , despite his protestations that he doesn't lie , we trust his tale the least . in the end , we are left recognizing only one thing : that there is no such thing as an objective truth . kurosawa's most brilliant move in rashomon is never to reveal what really happened . every time i watch the film , i come away with a slightly different opinion of what transpired in the woods . but not knowing remains a source of fascination , not one of frustration , and therein lies kurosawa's greatest achievement . it's worth saying something about the style employed by the director . the tone and approach of rashomon are radically different from anything western viewers are likely to be familiar with . the film is presented almost as visual poetry , paying a great deal of attention to sights and images while sound and dialogue have lesser importance . the cinematography is singularly evocative . it would be possible to watch rashomon without subtitles and still capture more than a small fraction of its essence . likewise , this film could have probably been equally successful during the silent era . as has been true throughout his entire career , kurosawa draws the best performances out of his actors . as the brash rogue at the center of the controversy , toshiro mifune is wonderfully robust . that's the brilliance of kurosawa's vision and mifune's performance . equally good is masayuki mori as the doomed noble . once again , the differences serve to emphasize that this is the same person seen from different perspectives . the most striking portrayal , however , belongs to the radiant machiko kyo , whose mesmerizing , seductive character varies the most from narrative to narrative . today , nearly fifty years after it was made , rashomon has lost none of its fascination or power . it's still a marvelous piece of cinema that asks unanswerable questions of great import . films like courage under fire may capture some of the spirit of rashomon , but no movie before or since has presented these issues in quite the same unique and intense fashion . in every sense of the word , this is a true classic . it's hard to find a more rewarding way to spend ninety minutes . - ingmar bergman ",1,1.8642379339099998e-42,0.996252114655,0.003747885345
"this is a hint -- not that anyone needs one -- that their cruise will be anything but . when the inevitable disaster hits , annie proclaims ,  i'll swear , i'm never leaving the house again .  welcome to speed 2 : cruise control . speed was a textbook example of how to craft a taut action thriller with every scene choreographed for maximum adrenaline rush . any sequel was bound to disappoint , and so does this one . not so much in comparison to the original as to what it could have been . swat member alex shaw ) and a lack of focus on bullock , who deserved a more central and better written role , are the script's chief downfalls . still the action does work , and most audiences will not be disappointed . patric , who played shakes in last year's sleepers , gives a completely mechanical performance as a daredevil extraordinaire . in the original , keanu reeves did some incredible stunts , but he made his character human and vulnerable . in contrast , patric approaches every disaster with the assurance of an actor who knows that this is only a stunt so there is no reason to worry . no problem , he'll jump in the water near the propeller , while any sane man would worry that it would cut him to pieces . robocop had about as much self-doubt , which is none at all . reeves and bullock oozed chemistry , yet showed little physical affection . in contrast , patric and bullock talk about sex , even if they are never shown doing it , but demonstrate little genuine romance . bullock , when not in the shadow of or being courted by patric , gives a good performance . easily the best scene in the show has her showing her resilience to adversity . a convenient chain saw . speed 2 never takes itself too serious . ( most engineering schools probably don't disclose this . ) in the spirit of the original speed , his plan to take control of the ship is ingenious and full of technical details . dafoe takes a surprisingly understated approach to his character . i respect him for what he was trying to do , but it drained the show of too much of its tension . andrew davis's under siege covered a similar subject with much better results because tommy lee jones gave us a more explosive and unpredictable villain . the movie's best performance is given by first-time movie actress christine firkins as a 13-year-old deaf girl named drew . i cannot say enough good things about firkins's acting ability . a charismatic actress who takes what could have been a cliched character and transforms her into a frightened but resourceful girl and a character worth caring about . like most recent action picture endings , this one goes on too long . unlike the others , speed 2 manages to throw so much at us that it stays fun much longer than expected . the little pooch's fun becomes so infectious that i found myself applauding at one piece of the conclusion's campy humor . speed 2 runs longer than necessary at 2 : 13 . it is rated pg-13 for disaster action and violence . the film would be fine for kids say nine and up , depending on how well they handle disaster movies . i had enough fun to be able to recommend the picture and give it * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : june 11 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"people who exist only in one's imagination are common in childhood and in films . albert is played by haley joel osment in the strongest performance in the movie . haley , whom you may recognize as forrest junior in forrest gump , is as assertive as he is cute . his voice projects with an authority that surpasses many adults . director norman jewison cuts away quickly so as to remove any chance of emotional impact . throughout this uneven movie he will retain this proclivity to shy away from more than surface depth . the characters , albert being the exception , are outlined adequately , but they are only partially filled in , leaving the viewer with a frustratingly incomplete feeling . since albert is white and harriet is black , this might cause some challenges to be dealt with , but this script pays the issue scant attention . graffiti-encased newark is cast against type . rather than its usual collection of drug dealers and gangs , we see it as a friendly working class town . for those of us who have lived in new jersey , albeit not in newark , it is refreshing to see someone look upon its brighter side . although the child actor gives an excellent performance , the adults are merely adequate . depardieu plays his part whimsically , but little more . a more complex interpretation of his character would have helped . she develops little genuine chemistry with anyone else in the picture . it is plausible that harriet starts off tough . but when the inevitable emotional crack finally comes , it happens too late and too unconvincingly . notwithstanding these problems , the film does have its magical moments and none more so than when harriet and bogus are transformed in a daydream to a pair of dancers a la fred astaire and ginger rogers . this scene was presaged earlier in another movie on the television . while always pleasant and sometime downright charming , jewison's film remains strangely uninvolving . the ingredients are there but he has trouble staging them into a compelling whole . bogus runs too long at 1 : 50 . it is rated pg for a little bad language and its more serious themes . it would be fine for kids around 6 and up . my son jeffrey , age 8 , said he thought the film was  okay , but it can get a little boring at times .  since i never disliked the film and since there are several touchingly funny portions , i am giving the film a mild thumbs up and * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"the better you know movies , the more appreciation you'll have for the wit and energy of barry sonnenfeld's get shorty . while it's quite possible for the cinematically unaware to enjoy this film--it's got a fair amount of readily-accessible comedy and action--this is a real treat for movie buffs . the story is as much about the love of motion pictures as it is about gangsters . scott frank's script for get shorty , which lifts huge chunks of dialogue directly from the book , captures the spirit of elmore leonard's work the way no previous adaptation has been able to ( the moonshine war , stick , cat chaser ) . this film is wry and sardonic all the way through , with the actors and director knowing exactly how to play each scene for maximum effect . get shorty is much more a comedy than anything else , and a very funny one at that . and when chili starts to pitch an idea , none other than big time actor martin weir ( danny devito ) shows interest . his comeback work in pulp fiction may have been effective , but he's better here . with a fine supporting cast that includes danny devito , rene russo , and the always-reliable gene hackman , travolta is surrounded by talent . it would have taken a poor director to botch up this production . one of the great pleasures of watching get shorty is that you don't have to turn off your brain while the film is on screen . the script is smart , and makes few concessions to mentally challenged audience members . there's a lot going on beyond the obvious . take role reversals , for example . ultimately , it turns out that the common denominator for success in either career is attitude--a quality which chili possesses in abundance . those familiar with pulp fiction may detect hints of that film here , and not just because of travolta's presence . much of the dialogue has the same kind of quirky , snappy quality as that which tarantino writes . ( quentin is an admitted leonard fan ; in fact , his next directorial effort may be an adaptation of the author's rum punch . ) and  i . e .  on another occasion , chili lectures martin on the importance of a stare . the ending is a little reminiscent of that of the player , with a couple of big name cameos . it's a clever way to conclude a wonderfully entertaining romp . get shorty may indeed be 1995's pulp fiction , but this less profane film is likely to find wider acceptance . it's certainly more mainstream , but , at least in this case , that's not a bad thing . with get shorty , sonnenfeld has shown that broad appeal doesn't necessarily equate with stupidity . that's a lesson hollywood should learn .

"unfortunately , perhaps because first time writer/director miguel arteta is attempting to tackle too many issues , or because he doesn't have a good feel for anything below the surface , much of this movie comes across as shallow and melodramatic . spain's stiff and unconvincing performance does little to draw us into his character's life and bring us face-to-face with his many dilemmas . while i can't think of another film that covers all of the ground traversed by star maps , the film frequently ventures into territory that was examined more effectively by such diverse offerings as my family , once were warriors , and johns . as a result , watching star maps is likely to generate a sense of deja vu . someone once said that all movies are basically copies of others , and , while it doesn't always seem that way , in this case it does . there's enough material in star maps to keep a soap opera going for several weeks , if not months . the characters are all drawn broadly , and the direction lacks subtlety ( the moment we see a bottle of pills being hidden behind some cans , we know it's going to be important later in the film ) . there are a pair of interesting personalities here -- carlos' sister , maria , and pepe's mistress , letti -- but neither is accorded enough screen time to do more than briefly arrest our attention . for the most part , the acting is amateurish , which is disappointing , although not surprising , considering the film's low budget . but , while the movie lacks strong performances , its greatest weakness is the writing . in trying to original , arteta inserts several offbeat comic sequences ( carlos accepting an oscar after an award-winning performance in bed , a bizarre dinner conversation ) that , while funny as stand-alone pieces , clash violently with the overriding tone . the ending is also problematic . while it's supposed to be ambiguous , it's actually frustrating , leaving all sorts of loose ends dangling . despite all of its flaws , however , star maps still has a soap opera-type appeal . it's not the kind of movie many people will walk out on , because , even considering its lack of depth , it retains the ability to hook a viewer into wondering what happens next . there's enough sex , violence , and boiling-point emotion to capture the attention of even the most easily-distracted viewer . ultimately , however , star maps doesn't amount to much more than several ideas that are never effectively translated into anything more potent than sudsy drivel .  the cinema is not an art which films life : the cinema is something between art and life . unlike painting and literature , the cinema both gives to life and takes from it . . .  - jean-luc godard ",0,0.997401227008,7.892752947079999e-76,0.00259877299245
"oliver stone , one of our most visceral directors , rarely makes anything but engaging films . he received oscars for his hard-hitting platoon and born on the fourth of july , but even his films like jfk , which are nothing less than balderdash , are fascinating and involving pieces of filmmaking . like him or hate him or both , his pictures are always in your face . u-turn can be argued to be one of stone's most shocking films since it is shockingly mediocre . people are likely to leave the theater neither engaged nor enraged . every frame is oversaturated with grainy colors , and the images frequently jump as if filmed with a strobe light . his obsession with panning and zooming will have you ready to cry uncle before the end of the first reel . the script by john ridley , which is based on his book  stray dogs ,  relies on a stream of quirky characters to create his version of a black comedy . with stone as the director , half of hollywood shows up to take part . now , that's a part i could do . the star of the film , and the only one worth seeing is sean penn . in recent times penn's talent has become increasing evident . here , as in this year's she's so lovely , he steals the show . billy bob thornton plays darrell with a face caked in grease like a cartoon character who just walked into an explosion and with teeth that looks like he's been eating dirt . darrell flashes bobby a smile that says  i am about to take you for everything you have since i'm your only hope of getting out of this hellhole .  why aren't you one of them ?  is voight really this far gone ? why does this once excellent actor only takes roles that are caricatures ? penn saves the film , but just barely . a week after you have seen the show , only the film's bold , but repetitiously tiring cinematographic techniques will remain in your memory . nothing else about the film is unusual enough to be remembered , and that is the tragedy . has stone gone soft ? it is rated r for gore , sex , brief nudity , and profanity . the film would be fine for older teenagers . for penn's performance i give the film a mild recommendation and * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : october 1 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"a thrilling but shamelessly manipulative political thriller , the second feature dealing with presidential politics from the director who was once a film critic , rod lurie ( deterrence ) . he has vastly honed his skills as a filmmaker in comparison with his debut film , which was a failure artistically and commercially .  the contender  is a film that is grounded in having a clear understanding of how politically underhanded and sly the system is and how those in it operate on a level that would make machiavelli proud of them . i was taken aback by how great the entire ensemble cast is , with the leads being superb in getting the maximum out of their juicy roles , even if they have to chew the scenery to do it . the cast is so good that it overcomes the shrill oratory , the manipulative , obvious and unbelievable political situations , and an ending that tries to play it so safe , that it takes away the juice in the story that gave this film its power in the first place . i thoroughly enjoyed it , even though i knew it was a manipulative film , trying to get me to bite at its revelations about the double-standards between men and women politicians , without giving me a fair chance to swallow everything without choking on what i was asked to swallow . this only occurs when he orders something ordinary -- a muenster cheese sandwich . there was something about that action that didn't seem right . it will later on play an important part in the film's plot . it makes the viewer face the fact that a woman in high office is still a woman and has to be accepted just like a man in that position would be . hanson refuses to comment on the issue , taking the high moral ground , saying it is no one's business but her own . senator hanson is seen as both a liberal and a vegetarian . the story in itself is more soap opera than drama , but what gives it verve is the super performances from the three stars , jeff bridges , gary oldman , and joan allen . they give depth to their roles and they are all seen in many different lights and shades . jeff bridges steals every scene he is in , offering a fascinating look at a president who could be likable though sinister , sneakily clever , and also very politically human in a generous and gracious way . he was thoroughly believable as an updated bill clinton-type , post-lewinsky . this film is a pro-clinton one , taking aim at those who dig up dirt and cast aspersions in a hypocritical way , when it is evident that both sides are capable of using the same bag of dirty tricks to further their own cause . the film was fascinating when it didn't have a message to deliver with some bogus pat speech and , instead , set up a logical argument showing that senator hanson should be confirmed for office despite allegations of her youthful sex scandal .

"director jean-luc godard's contempt ( le mepris ) has been hailed by some critics as one of the best films ever made . the dialog remains more romantic than sexual although with brigitte bardot playing the part of the wife , camille javal , the audiences at the time of the picture's release may have had trouble concentrating on the lines spoken . ( the modicum of female rear nudity may have been a bit shocking at the time , but the movie is quite tame by today's standards . ) godard's film wants to challenge your mind and not titillate your senses , hence the few nude scenes are there more for realism than exploitation . brigitte bardot gives an incredible performance as the 28-year-old typist who does not have a clue about what she wants in life . the film works precisely because she convinces us of her disdain for most aspects of her life , especially her marriage . what could he have said or done that made her feel thus ? when odyssey's director fritz lang , played by the great director himself , starts talking about how cultured the performance will be , jerry will have none of it .  every time i hear the word culture , i bring out my checkbook ,  he declares as he writes a check on the spot to paul to rewrite the script . lacking the smooth refinements of the rest of the characters , jerry , played by jack palance , is crude but believes himself more refined than any of them .  gods , i like gods ,  he says about his movie .  i know exactly how they feel .  godard has a great sense for the visual , and his films are feasts for the eyes . in contempt several scenes are memorable . and then , who could forget the opening scene of her lying on the sheets with her toes twirling in the air . my personal favorite aspect of the production is the music by georges delerue . it has a timelessness and a sweeping grandeur that starts off romantic but becomes increasingly morose as the tragedy unfolds . the film is about many things . certainly godard's love of the cinema comes across in ways explicit and subtle . the film , which is more a dramatic tone poem than a traditional movie , ultimately is about the impact of the death of love . effusive jerry couldn't care less about any of this . contempt is an entrancing and moving film that leaves its audiences thinking and somewhat devastated . one may forget many of the story's details , but its impact will remain . contempt runs 1 : 45 but feels much shorter perhaps because the story takes place in less than 24 hours . the film is partially in french with english subtitles and partially in english . it is not rated but would be a mild r for some female rear nudity , a little profanity , and a little violence . the film would be fine for teenagers . i strongly recommend you see or rent this marvelous film , and i give it * * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : august 16 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"this is raimi's attempt to go mainstream with an art film thriller that might have an appeal to an audience that likes films that give them some ideas to ponder . this wintry morality tale , its bleak snowbound midwestern atmosphere reminds me a lot of fargo , without the comedy , as it examines the character of three small town locals who have no worldly experience , but have adjusted in one way or another to their lot in life . billy bob is particularly outstanding in his true-to-life characterization of such an individual . but as a result , her interference makes things worse . this is a dilemma for the filmmakers , there seems to be something devoid about this tale that can't surface , except in outwardly visual terms , as we clearly see how morality is drawn in terms of black and white . there is the great shot of the snow in all its whiteness and the black crows surrounding the downed plane , as this sighting of where the money is seems to be a symbol for the film's morality play . the result of all the trio's bungling , is that things are no longer simple for them , as greed and their extended version of the american dream , but this time earned the too easy way , via a suitcase full of money found in the snow , becomes too much for them to handle with any sensibility , as all their character flaws become magnified , and they begin to get careless and talk too much of what they found . this is a strong gut-wrenching suspense film , one of the top ten of 1998 . but the film is just lacking something , and i think that thing it needed , was a breath of vagueness about what is morally right or wrong in order for the story to remain on an even psychological/spiritual keel and not descend into a literal biblical morality theme . raimi did a superb visual job , carefully weaving a noir tale without any heroes or apparent villains , a difficult task to do , but one that he succeeds in without question . my feeling is , that in due time , we will look back at this film and wonder how it was overlooked by so many , as it will become recognized as one of the great suspense classics .

"new zealand , 1995 u . s . release date : not known running length : 0 : 52 mpaa classification : no mpaa rating ( mature themes , brief nudity ) theatrical aspect ratio : 1 . 85 : 1 shown at the philadelphia festival of world cinema , 5/6/97 & 5/9/97 with some  mockumentaries  ( or  meta-documentaries  ,  pseudo- documentaries  , or whatever else you want to call them ) , it's best not to know beforehand that they're fakes . with this film , if you don't know in advance that it isn't a real documentary , you'll almost certainly be bamboozled , and , in the process , miss some of the most subtle humor . taken at face value , forgotten silver is mildly entertaining , but , for those who recognize its true nature , it's nothing short of brilliant . jeffrey thomas , a man with an appropriately stentorian voice , does the narration for forgotten silver , which is presented as a straightforward documentary about an all-but-forgotten , turn-of-the- century new zealand film maker . his achievements included inventing the first mechanized camera , making the first full-length feature film with sound ( in 1908 -- it was a failure because all of the actors spoke chinese and he didn't have the foresight to invent subtitles ) , experimenting with color ( in 1911 -- he was arrested on smut charges because a topless woman appeared in the test film ) , and introducing the closeup . movie critic/historian leonard maltin gushes about the scope and quality of mckenzie's work . actor sam neill comments about the importance of the mckenzie revelations to the new zealand film industry . using subtle special effects to re-create old , damaged footage , forgotten silver makes it easy to believe that we're seeing celluloid that has been stored in a shed for fifty years . not only are we treated to glimpses of mckenzie's pioneering efforts in cinema , but we're shown significant chunks of salome , a credible-looking silent presentation of the biblical tale about the dancing girl who demanded john the baptist's head . while the film makers have crafted forgotten silver as a first- rate parody , it's clear that both men possess a great deal of affection for and knowledge about the early history of cinema . this is the sort of project one might expect from peter jackson , the inventive director whose previous outings have included the brilliant heavenly creatures , the outrageously sick meet the feebles , and the big-budget , offbeat comedy , the frighteners . along with co- director costa botes , jackson has put together one of the most interesting fake documentaries to come along since the genre was first popularized with this is spinal tap . the more you love film and understand film history , the more you'll get out of this picture , but even the most oblivious movie-goers will find forgotten silver's mixture of fact and fiction enjoyable . when this movie was shown on new zealand tv , it's impact was akin to that of orson welles' legendary halloween radio broadcast of war of the worlds . this simple fact shouldn't be taken as an indication of new zealanders' gullibility , but of the effectiveness of forgotten silver . watch it carefully , and you'll be amused , amazed , and entertained .

"watching the most infectious comic moment in the british import the full monty -- a film rich with infectious comic moments -- can teach you a lot about what so many hollywood comedies get so wrong . it's a wonderful bit of comic film-making , surprisingly restrained and staged with impeccable momentum and timing . it also comes in a context which gives the laughter more bite . their spontaneous burst of energy in that dole queue is a physical manifestation of optimism . they're trying something to become men again , by god , even if it's as ridiculous a notion as dropping trou -- or going  the full monty  in brit-speak -- in front of 400 howling women . now i'm not saying it isn't worth several chuckles simply watching the out-of-shape mates muddle their way through their pirouettes and pelvic thrusts ; incongruity is the mother of classic physical comedy . i'm willing to wager , however , that a hollywoodized version of the full monty would miss the point entirely . in this hypothetical american monty , the idea of six working-class blokes becoming strippers , none of them ideal physical specimens , would be treated as inherently hilarious . it would become a broad farce , with chris farley re-creating his  saturday night live  sketch challenging patrick swayze for a spot in the chippendales line-up . the full monty isn't an effective comedy because the stars are unattractive . it's an effective comedy because the characters _are_ attractive , because their dilemma is genuine and their solution is ripe with possibilities . ironically , the most noteworthy flaws in the full monty might have been erased by a good old hollywood script doctoring . screenwriter simon beaufoy dangles a few too many plot threads for no apparent reason , including a gay romance which never matters much to the story . dramatic confrontations interfere with the comedic flow , as though beaufoy didn't trust the performances and basic plot situations to generate enough sympathy for his characters . though not nearly as pedantic as the similarly-themed brassed off ! , the full monty still treads dangerously close to pathos at times , clashing with the lads' growing enthusiasm for their new calling . the full monty may be a high-concept premise , but the execution is resolutely low-concept . that's a combination hollywood is having a tough time putting together in its comedies . comedy with ideas doesn't have to be leaden ; comedy with big laughs doesn't have to be simple-minded . the full monty gives depth to dole-line disco . . . _that's_ high comedy . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line  subscribe  .

"this lighthearted fantasy asks , what if the idealist h . g . wells didn't just write about the time machine but lived it ! it's mainly an emotionally flat , one running joke type of lightweight literary film that is done in by a very dull middle section and too much unnecessary gore . the director-writer nicholas meyer ( star trek 11 ) -- he also wrote the witty novel  seven percent solution  -- worked the screenplay from his own novel , showing some clever touches here and there , but not enough to hold my interest for the duration of the film . the theme grew tiresome and david warner as jack the ripper never developed as a particularly interesting villain . there was nothing gained by seeing him hold a scalpel to a woman's throat and then slit it . if you don't have the key , you can't return . in san francisco , there are some amusing moments as the naive wells has to adjust to the modern complexities of the world and its hustle and bustle . he seems adorably old-fashioned and gentlemanly , with a very stand-offish british wit , while she's an aggressive woman's libber , a modern california-type of lady , and an admirer of british eccentrics who are straight . it just advanced in technology but regressed into a more violent state than ever before . the film has many plot holes and flaws , one of them is : that it is not possible to go back in time and change history , all one can change is something that is only a duplicate , even if you think you are changing something , you are only deceived by appearances . albert einstein mentioned that about time travel and that's good enough for me . the jack the ripper part of the story never really worked as a thriller , it all seemed too heavy and misplaced , i am certain the film could have been salvaged if it kept with the fantasy/romance story between amy and wells . that part of the film was amusing and gave way to some interesting insights about the modern world . the film suffered from being too poorly presented , as it always appeared less than exciting , nevertheless it was occasionally diverting , and some cult sci-fi fans might like it more than the general public should .

"unfortunately , this is also among the weakest of the early bond films , although connery is in peak form . the plot is the problem . it stretches the limits of credibility , even as that word is applied to bond movies . the first half of you only live twice is very good , with several skillfully-executed action sequences and the development of an unexpectedly warm relationship between bond and aki . it's only during the second half , as the plot escalates beyond the bounds of preposterousness , that the film starts to fragment . some viewers enjoy 007's most outrageous outings ; i prefer a little restraint ( and i emphasize the  a little  part ) . wild chases , neat gadgets , and death- defying escapes are fine ; rockets that swallow up spacecraft are a bit too extravagant . the unmasking of blofeld is a disappointment . here , he's seen for the first time , and it's a letdown when all we get is a rather ordinary-looking donald pleasance -- a solid actor , to be sure , but not very good at creating a diabolical personality . nevertheless , any bond movie with sean connery can't be all bad , and there are the usual chases , fights , and amazing stunts -- all sprinkled with a dash of japanese flavoring . in short , while you only live twice falls somewhere in the middle of the 007 film heap , it still offers that unique brand of wit , style , and adventure that only comes with bond .

"nelly and monsieur arnaud ( nelly et m . arnaud ) is a french film that garnered numerous awards there . for me the film is a fascinating character study of nelly and monsieur arnaud , but others will probably characterize the picture as a romance to which i would not argue . this is one of those rare films that appears to have no actors . these characters are so realistically drawn that i did not for a minute think i was observing actors , rather i was eavesdropping on real life . if you must have sex or nudity or if you need dramatic events and fast pacing to enjoy a movie , do not waste your time with nelly and monsieur arnaud as you will be quite disappointed . this is a film that takes its own sweet time and one with a satisfying but slightly surprising ending of the sort you hardly ever see in american films . don't try to guess the ending you will be wrong , and anyway , the fruits to be savored of this film are getting to know the characters . both have excellent bodies and the camera loves them . for good looking characters , their talent has nothing to do with their physical attractiveness . moreover the performances by beart and serrault are compelling and worthy of academy award consideration . most of the show for me remains a beautiful character study of two people . the script by jacques fieschi , claude sautet , and yves ulmann is exquisite . director claude sautet takes a story and slowly wraps his audience into it . a mesmerizing tale . nelly and monsieur arnaud runs 1 : 46 with carefully and almost dreamy editing by jacqueline thiedot . the picture is in french with easy to follow english subtitles . the film is not rated , but would be pg or pg-13 . there is no sex , nudity , or violence . i remember only a single mild cuss word . given the subject matter , my guess is that it would not interest kids under 10 , but i don't see how it could harm anyone . i recommend this delightful talkfest of a film to you and give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : may 31 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"smilla's sense of snow ( say it three times fast and sound like an asp ) opens with a breathtaking image : great cliffs of gray-blue ice towering over a vast plain of white . and , while this sequence seems completely disconnected with the movie that follows , it is a visually pleasing way to introduce a contemporary mystery that incorporates murder , greed , and science fiction into an often uneven , occasionally preposterous , but always engrossing whole . although the action transpires entirely in copenhagen and greenland , the dialogue is exclusively in english , with nary a subtitle to be found . as thrillers go , smilla's sense of snow is definitely unconventional . the storyline is reasonably complex ( not to mention a little silly ) and features enough small surprises and twists to retain the average viewer's attention . and , the fact that it's a  why-dunnit  or  how-dunnit ,  rather than a  who-dunnit ,  allows us to focus on more interesting issues than identifying possible red herrings . as crisply directed by bille august ( pelle the conqueror ) , smilla's sense of snow moves rapidly -- almost too rapidly . the plot clicks along so briskly that numerous character details get lost in the rush . smilla , as forcefully portrayed by ormond , is a fascinating character , but many of the more interesting aspects of her personality are relegated to the background . in fact , there were times when i actually became annoyed at the film for pursuing the plot with single-minded determination rather than taking a few moments to delve more deeply into the main character . smilla is presented with enough detail to tantalize , but not enough to satisfy . in the end , we're left wishing the movie had spent a little more time filling in a few more blanks . aside from ormond , whose turn as smilla is both effective and attention-grabbing , and richard harris , who brings a world-weary cynicism to his part , the acting is surprisingly lackluster . he's supposed to be enigmatic , but the actor's one-note performance makes him lifeless . the film's climax will probably seem preposterous for anyone expecting smilla's sense of snow to stay grounded in reality . if nothing else , the opening sequence should prepare you to accept that boundaries not normally crossed in murder mysteries will be broken . smilla's sense of snow is not a landmark thriller , nor is it likely to appeal to those who demand a semblance of reality . but it is involving and entertaining , and features an intriguing , independent heroine . those things alone make it worth a trip to a nearby theater .

"post coitum is an unusual film about human sexual relations - both because it's told completely from the woman's perspective and because it shows graphically but always tastefully the heat of passion . most movies about adultery have a quick tryst and then the character spends the rest of the movie in anguish . when the movie turns tragic , rouan the director should have retained better control of rouan the actor , but in the protagonist's downfall , as in her ecstasy , her emotions are quite palpable . the movie is encumbered with two needless side-plots . eliminating both would have made for a cleaner narrative . if someone had defended diane's actions , they might argue that she loved too much and none too wisely . the movie is in french with english subtitles . it is not rated but would probably get an r for nudity , graphic sex , and profanity . the movie is not appropriate for teenagers .

"even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor , his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality . like everyone else , dreyfuss has bills to pay , so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies . let me start out by saying that krippendorf's tribe is occasionally funny ( although never riotously so ) , but that's about its only asset . the best word to describe this film is  asinine .  the target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes , which are aimed at someone going through puberty . krippendorf's tribe tries to be a zany , off-the-wall comedy , but the film makers have forgotten three important rules . the first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist . the second is that viewers should be able to identify with , or at least care about , a character or two . finally , and most importantly , more than 5% of the jokes have to work . the only way krippendorf's tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters ( not to mention the viewers ) are dumber than dirt . unfortunately , it's impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this . director todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags . meanwhile , attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture ( i . e . , how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend ) come across as feeble and derivative . the acting in underwhelming . dreyfuss has definitely not given his  all  to the role of james krippendorf . this quality , while fine for a 22-minute television program , quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a feature-length movie . no one in the supporting cast -- lily tomlin , david ogden stiers , natasha lyonne ( woody allen's daughter in everyone says i love you ) -- excels . i know that a movie's in trouble when it's half the length of titanic , but seems much longer . most of what comes on screen is generic sit-com level material -- the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set . if there's any upside , it's that i don't see much box-office support developing for this lame , ill-marketed miscue . - ingmar bergman ",2,0.0220843499858,3.0390085744599995e-44,0.9779156500139999
"every once in a while , i come upon a movie where i simply can't get beyond the basic premise ; as well as certain individual elements might be executed , i'm so turned off by that premise that i can't possibly enjoy the film . there is some charm to be found in the performances , but overall it simply depressed me , and wrapped up a disturbing package far too neatly . becomes the tale of a cruel prank perpetrated on a deeply disturbed little boy , and it becomes extremely unpleasant to watch . aims for an inappropriately upbeat conclusion . dad makes a relatively sincere apology , but for a film which uses serious family problems to set up its hijinks , it's disappointingly timid in dealing with the repercussions . a certain amount of contrivance is practically required in capers such as this , but josh and s . a . m . really pushes the envelope . the event which forces josh to run is a strained sequence involving chris penn as a drunken texan , and he really doesn't work . most baffling is the role played by martha plimpton , an ill-defined runaway who appears and disappears without leaving any recognizable imprint on the story . somewhere in that character was a relevant back-story , but it never made it to the screen . there is even a tossed-off attempt to make her a romantic interest for josh , which is raised and resolved in under five minutes of screen time . as disturbed and disappointed as i was in the story , i have to acknowledge the appeal of the two lead performances . jacob tierney is very good as the bright and resourceful josh , best of all in the obligatory  fool the stupid cop  sequence , and noah fleiss brings real heartbreak to the truly confused sam . the two are convincing brothers throughout , and i liked the rapport between them . still , i found myself dwelling on its handling of a serious subject matter in a manner i found inappropriate . there is no such thing as an objective review , but in this case i can't even pretend otherwise . i found nothing fun about watching two kids in desperate need of therapy taking a joy ride .

"alvin's eyesight is so poor , that he doesn't have a driver's license , he walks with a cane , has a bad hip , has emphysema , and is as stubborn as a mule ; therefore , even though , it doesn't make too much sense to travel the way he does , no one can talk him out of it . the film reeks of midwestern wholesomeness , folksiness , and homespun philosophies . that it works so well , is a testament to richard farnsworth's compelling characterization and the flavor the film captures of the genuine straight people playing straight man to alvin straight on the two-lane highway he takes across the mississippi river to wisconsin . it features a road show of ordinary folks , consisting of those who can be kind to a stranger who is doing something he probably ought not be doing . their ordinary lives are put under the microscope in a slow-moving tale that is not in a hurry to get to the end of its journey , as the strangers talk to each other , seriously listen to each other , and we as an audience get to know all of them reasonably well . as a change of pace , american viewers might welcome a pause from all the action films and whacky stories they are inundated with , and take a reality check to see if they are interested in seeing a film that most of them could have been in . times .  the film plays as if it was a foreign film , since it is rare for an american film to be so self-conscious of itself , so interested in just looking at the open blue sky , the blowing wheatfields , the bare streets of a sleepy town , and having its star find peace with himself without any reason or big event in the film . it is also a film that knows how to keep proper time with its slow-moving story and the slow-moving transport of its hero . by doing this , it suggests that his life can be carefully digested without everything being brought to a conclusion before it needs to be . some of the vignettes worked better than others , but what was always convincing was how the unsophisticated but straight-forward manner of farnsworth , came across in such an appealing way , a way many americans would like to think of themselves as actually being . yet , lynch handled it correctly by just indicating by her changing facial expressions that something was clicking inside her and that she was becoming less confused about what to do , and by having her symbolically show that she understood what alvin told her to do . fortunately , nothing much is made of this event , except alvin has the common sense to have some deer meat for his nightly camp fire . the film moves into territory where people of good nature really communicate with each other and offer whatever support they can to each other , and it is the right support because they have tapped into the source that gives them such character , which is what the kindly relationship that developed between danny and alvin offered . this film was just right for what it wanted to do ; it felt good seeing alvin's journey find closure . the sentimentality of the film was kept to the minimum and lynch did not try to make this small story grander than what it was , and that's a good thing , because the smallness of the story is what made this film seem so elegant and it is also what made it seem epic . but , in a film that goes only surface deep in uncovering the mythos about small-town america and its elderly , it becomes unfortunate that the filmmaker couldn't delve deeper and get more out of the story , as it seems as if this is a story waiting to be pried open even wider by someone who is not stuck on what seems to be the obvious but wants to make some waves with the politics of such small-town conservatism and question why the towns look so dry and shrivelled-up , the people seem so unintellectual , and the places visited so dull , notwithstanding , how kindly its citizens can act in an emergency . after initially being very pleased with the film , i got to wondering what i learned about alvin straight that i didn't know when the film began ; and , though i thought that alvin's reflections about his life were genuine , i still didn't really know what he is all about by the film's end , even if i now knew his darkest secret , and that is what troubles me most about this film . there is something about his life that makes me think of alvin as not only a likable character , which is what i found him to be , but someone who is so set-in-his-ways that he cannot evolve further , and he is someone who is so accepting of the  american way of life ,  that it seems a shame that he can't find anything to say that questions the america and its institutions he was prepared to give his life for during ww11 . he would be someone who would make a good poster boy for the religious right . there seems to be no rebel in alvin , as lynch seems to accept his status quo without any hesitation . alvin , for all his appeal , just seems to be another blind follower of the so-called american value system . it was difficult for me to see lynch's motivations for making this simple story without offering any ruffles in the feathers of the american eagle . though , he certainly has a right to see things the way he does ; it , nevertheless , is disconcerting to see a film that is so accepting of the institutional american values without even questioning them . but if this is just a mild tale about an old-timer , doing something a little ornery , then it works and is pleasant to look at , just like it is pleasant to have a conversation on main street with some real people . it makes you feel good , but is that challenging enough ? i still don't know what lynch's motivation is for making this walt disney family value production film , except it seems to be an ode to traditional values , which seems odd coming from him , especially since he is known , rightly or wrongly , for making films that are supposed to be on-the-cutting-edge . there was nothing daring about this film , as its appeal is mostly through the magnificent performance of richard farnsworth , who is a movic relic , chiseled in dignity with his weather-beaten face and his geezer-like sensibilities shining through . he is someone beyond acting criticism , and whatever failings or misplaced points there are to his story , the film is still a relatively interesting work , retaining something about the american mythos that is worth investigating further ; this is a film that is well-crafted and well-worth seeing , and this is so because lynch knows how to film a story in a thoroughly professional manner . as for lynch personally , i don't have the foggiest idea what his real beliefs are or what his changing career moves might mean , but as far as this film goes , he seems to be very accepting of the status quo .

"there is no doubt in my mind that david duchovny can be a movie star . his often under-appreciated work on  the x-files  has demonstrated both dramatic chops and a wry sense of humor , as well as the requisite physicality for action . duchovny has the looks , the smarts and the range on the big screen to go places most fellow tv alums never go . it's also clear that he knows how to pick interesting scripts . to a resume which already includes unconventional fare like kalifornia and the rapture , duchovny adds mark haskell smith's playing god . smith's script does about all you could ask a script to do , delivering some well-developed characters and smart dialogue ( okay , there are a couple of howlers ) in service of that premise . duchovny selected a nice piece of material to work with , but playing god shows that an actor can't choose most of the things which go into the making of a good film . it has the feel of a film which should have been much better , but turned out inconsistent and sloppy under the first-time direction of andy wilson ( of the popular cable mystery series  cracker  ) . there are times when wilson tries so hard to create his gritty thriller atmosphere -- all distorted imagery , slow motion and awkward cross-cutting -- that the narrative begins to get lost . he's going for the right mood , but with the wrong methods . duchovny also had no control over the performances of his cast-mates , though from all appearances , neither did the director . his performance might have been even more effective if a dozen other supporting players weren't making unhinged seem so unnecessary . the general tone of the performances makes duchovny stand out like buster keaton in a three stooges short . his deadpan demeanor begins to seem like a reaction to a bunch of nutcase actors let loose on the screen , rather than the appropriate personality for his redemption-hungry character . in fact , duchovny is too  together  most of the time ; rock bottom doesn't look all that bad if that's where he's supposed to be when we meet him . then again , it's hard to say whether that particular character choice was duchovny's to make . you can see his star quality in playing god , but you can also see that picking a sharp script is no guarantee that an actor will be in a sharply-made film . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line  subscribe  .

"can a film be saved by its music ? this is the question that i was pondering during the press screening for the plodding adaptation of the non-fiction book  hemingway in love and war : the lost diary of agnes von kurowsky .  outdoor scenes have majestic sounds full of horns and worthy of a vast symphony . in interior scenes we are treated to intimate violin serenades . every scene is filled with intense musical emotion . ah , but then there are those actors . maybe they should have heard the score during the shooting . perhaps the most charitable thing that can be said of the two leads is that they were miscast . certainly the performances they deliver are so insubstantial that they almost vanish upon closer examination . the love story between them is convincing in spurts , but , for the most part , the chemistry does not work . even less effective , and never believable is agnes's romance with the italian doctor domenico caracciolo ( emilio bonucci ) . much is made of their age difference , he being 19 and she being all of 26 , but they look about the same age in the movie so that is one of many aspects of the picture that were never believable .  you know what i've been told ?  remarks agnes in one of the first scenes .  it won't work ,  hemingway argues . the cinematography by roger pratt is handsome and warm , but the picture is content to be little more than pleasant . it is never involving . since i did not care about the characters , i resented some of the manipulative parts of the story . agnes and ernest then rig it so that jimmy wins . the love story between agnes and ernest is more hinted at than shown . i like love affairs that are believable and not ethereal . they do not have to be at all explicit to be great , see , for example , the age of innocence , but they must have enough emotional involvement to be convincing . any time you get this many people involved it is a recipe for disaster . perhaps this is the reason the story skims the surface and never invites you to go deeper . next to the miscasting of the leads , the script is the second biggest problem with the film . then there are the endings . for a while i thought the film was never going to end and that it was a special test version to see how long a dozen film critics would sit there in a dark room watching ending after ending before they gave up and left . we all stayed through the four , but a couple more and i might have been tempted to leave . at least toward the end , we do have a cheery note . i'll keep an eye on my watch waiting for that blessed event .  i love you ,  says agnes to ernest .  i'll love you as long as i live .  i wanted and expected to feel that way about this film , but i could not . to answer the question i asked in the beginning , perhaps some films can be saved by the music , but not this one . it is rated pg-13 for war wounds and for sexual situations , but no sex or nudity . i do not remember any profanity , but there probably was a little . the film would be fine for kids say ten and up . it is a close call , but i find the film too mediocre to recommend . i give it * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : january 20 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"the 81-year-old boris karloff's last completed feature film , could have and should have been better , as it suffers from a weakly-crafted script despite having great performances from the three prominent horror screen favorites who are in it- that would be karloff as professor marshe , christopher lee as morley , and barbara steele as lavinia . though , it is still worth seeing because of its star attractions and its innovative psychedelic offerings to the horror genre . bob scoffs at the witch story and the idea of ghosts being around , saying he knows little about such things . but the professor replies in his noted serious karloff movie tone ,  when the time comes , your skepticism might be only a fragile shield .  bob's conversations with the wheel-chaired bound professor are terse but highlight the film , as they are delivered with proper horror film affect . the film's not real frightening because there is a flatness to it ; but , it has its entertaining moments , and is a must see for karloff fans .

"this disney presentation of a time travel fantasy tale has the good sense not to try and spend too much time clearing up what theoretical scientists say is impossible : it is not possible to go back to the past and change history .  the kid  is a children's story but is stretched into an adult one as well . it is usually through dreams , drugs , one's creative work , psychoanalysis , or meditation that one looks back at their past , but bruce is too blocked for any of that . if one were to overlook all the impossibilities about this story and just concentrate on how the bruce willis character comes to resolve his problem , then the film is somewhat engaging . though , it is sad to say that he resolves his problem the typical macho way , by beating up his nemesis . the movie was ably directed by jon turtletaub ( while you were sleeping/phenomenon ) and written by audrey wells ( the truth about cats and dogs ) . it has a balanced mixture of adult sentimentalities and childish comedy that should bring both children and adults into the same movie theater , each finding something in the film to experience together . the idea of the film is intriguing , of a man who will live his future as he knows he should because he got to the bottom of what troubled him when he was growing up , and though the story is impossible and the self-absorbed bruce is now learning to be nice to those close to him that he has hurt before , seemed like a stretch , it is still a family-fare film with a few more ideas thrown in than the usual disney flicks . though this type of supernatural movie has been tried often ( back to the future/frequency/12 monkeys ) , this film had a nice quality to it , making it rather special . bruce willis works very well with children , he seems to be a natural , and all his previous films with children also attest to this , including his recent supernatural thriller  the sixth sense .

"writer and director david mamet's the winslow boy , loosely based on this actual case , is gem of a picture in the spirit of the age of innocence . most of the action , such as it is , takes place on the sidelines . people talk about trials and possible trials rather than attending them . emotions are carefully held in check as they would have been in that era , but the absolutely exquisite performances by the ensemble cast insure that the characters' feelings are nonetheless intense even though displayed with subtlety and grace . you may remember rebecca pidgeon as the slick confidence scheme operator from mamet's last picture , the spanish prisoner . she brings a compelling precision and intelligence to all of her parts . in a movie with a lesser cast , hawthorne's masterful performance would have stolen the movie , but his turns out to be but one of many bright lights .  if you tell me a lie , i shall know , because a lie between us can't be hidden ,  he warns . the boy , who looks like innocence personified , swears that he's not guilty . mamet , the master of ambiguity and unanswered questions , makes you wonder right away what the truth is and how that truth will be determined . as the charismatic and handsome sir robert , jeremy northam delivers an absolutely mesmerizing performance . a highly intelligent man who keeps his opponents and his supporters guessing what he will do next , sir robert is a master legal and political strategist and the type of busy man who allocates you only a few minutes of his precious time to see if it's worth ever seeing you again . the charged relationship between these two opposites , who have to pull together , turns out to be easily the most interesting of several subplots . like the rest of the movie , this relationship makes some twists you don't expect and avoids others that you do . although the script doesn't have much of mamet's signature dialog style , in which two characters exchange fast-paced staccato repartee , it has the overall structure he likes and has a host of fully developed characters . the heart-warming story is the type that frank capra would have loved . slowly and delicately the movie lays out a series of questions for us ? is the boy innocent , or might it not be as cut and dried as it seems ? the beauty and intelligence of the winslow boy methodically lays out questions where lesser movies would quickly provide easy answers . it is rated g and would be fine for kids old enough to be interested in serious subjects .

"a very pleasing rendition of a woody allen film , directed and written by woody . it is a fictional docudrama that smacks of woody's playfulness and love for jazz , and his inability to tell a straight story , but his great ability to tell a very personal one , which in this case is a very suitable way of telling it . the film also has the good sense to reach for woody's unique wit to get it through a few dry spells in the story . the joke that made me laugh the loudest , was when sean was bawling the girls out whom he pimped for about not bringing back enough money for him that night and they tell him , what do you expect , it's a jewish holiday ! it was the timing and the facial expressions seen on sean penn that made those kind of jokes work . the music was just beautiful to listen to and was played often enough during the course of the film , which should be pleasing to the aficionados of jazz . the film relies on the quirkiness of penn's performance to tell its lighthearted tale in a mock tone of seriousness , which captures the flavor of that period . her pantomine acting was in the best tradition of silent movies , as through her expressive facial gestures all the emotions she was feeling at the time were clearly seen ; all the long- sufferings that she has gone through . she also has a most pleasing smile , that anyone could understand . all the stories are so far apart , that none of the ridiculous versions could be verified by any of the experts , but what all the stories have in common , is that he hid in the backseat of the gangster's car and heard for sure that they were having an affair . woody's film is an appealing look back at that age of swing music and maybe a composite glimpse of how some jazzmen lived their lives . the great music played incudes the following renditions :  sweet sue ,   all of me ,   i'm forever blowing bubbles  and  i'll see you in my dreams .

"it goes without saying that no one walks into a film adaptation of a kafka novel expecting something created for general consumption . the trial , however , takes this a step further , as significant portions of the narrative are impossible to comprehend without an intimate knowledge of the author and his works . the book is strange ; the movie , even stranger . the trial is a visually impressive motion picture , with many beautifully framed , gothic-like shots of prague , where it was filmed . kyle maclachlan plays the part of josef k with an icy detachment that makes the character seem all too like another maclachlan personality--that of twin peaks' agent cooper ( odd how the actor seems to gravitate to bizarre projects ) . unfortunately , cooper and josef aren't anything alike , and mr . maclachlan's aloofness creates a schism between the audience and josef--it's difficult , if not impossible , to identify with the trial's protagonist . and what in the world is that on-and-off accent supposed to be ? certain minor themes of the film are easily recognizable--those of the corruption of justice and the dehumanization of society--but the overall message of the trial remains murky . in a key scene near the end , anthony hopkins delivers a lengthy parable that is supposed to clear things up , but this sequence is so cryptic that it can easily leave the viewer even more confused than before . high production values and good acting aren't everything . the film lacks energy , and comes across as a pedantic , obtuse , two-hour nightmare . since the intentions of this film ( and the novel from which it was adapted ) do not come across clearly ,  what's the point ?  kafka aficionados will likely find a great deal to chew over , but most everyone else will be baffled and perhaps even a little annoyed .

"whereas there are good movies for teenagers and adults opening almost every week , young kids have much less from which to choose . most weeks bring nothing new and when they do , the movies frequently are written assuming the kids are morons , hence any script , no matter how stupid , will suffice to attract the children to the show . this was one of those weeks when a kids' movie with some intelligence had its debut . the plot is nothing more than a recycled version of the first one , but hey , it is still funny and there are many great lines . chance says ,  they treat us pretty good here . three meals a day and all the smelly sneakers you can eat .  right away you see that , hands down , the best part of the show is the script by chris hauty . the animals , other than chance who is great , are not very emotive and frequently their expressions seem to have little to do with the words they speak but to which they do not move their lips . the directing ( david r . ellis ) is pretty lame , but the script and the voices save the day and create a delightful movie for children and the adults who are fortunate enough to get to join them . no one seems too concerned about going home , and the humans hardly ever appear in the film . never mind , as an animals roam around a lot movie , it works , again , thanks solely to the dialog . beauty and brains . i never cease to amaze myself .  although the show is sweet , it is highly uneven . there are long passages with a bunch of animals just chatting . this part is monotonous and needed stronger editing by peter e . berger and michael a . stevenson . when we have sharp ripostes between chance and sassy , with fast cuts and a little action , the movie comes into its own . we know where we are every step of the way .  finally , chance is at his best in the ending which wraps up the movie nicely . homeward bound ii runs only 1 : 29 and would have been a stronger movie with some of the slow scenes deleted . it is correctly rated g . there is no sex , bad language or human nudity of any kind . there is a little violence in that the dogs do snarl at each other and kind of wrestle around a bit plus there is a couple of scenes where it looks briefly like there is the potential for harm . this is all handled low key , and the movie did not seem to scare anyone in the theater . i missed the sense of purpose and direction that homeward bound had , but the sequel is worth seeing for the continuing funny dialog that will delight people of all ages . it is not a particularly fast paced movie , so may bore some kids . i recommend the movie to you and give it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"and , while there are significant differences between jan de bont's speed and andrei konchalovsky's 1985 thriller , runaway train , the films share two fundamental similarities : ferocious pacing and white- knuckle excitement . each picture features its own take on an unstoppable , high-velocity vehicle racing towards its doom . although speed is a very good movie , runaway train is a more complete experience . the script is better-written , depending more on visceral thrills than those enhanced by special effects ( that's not to say that runaway train is visually defective -- in fact , it's solid ) . the characters are better-rounded , and there is a fascinating exploration of man's primal instinct . runaway train belongs to a rare genre : the intelligent thriller . it will come as no surprise to educated movie-goers to learn that the script , credited to djordeje milicevic , paul zindel , and edward bunker , is based on an original screenplay devised by the japenese master , akira kurosawa . one can almost imagine kurosawa regular toshiro mifune in the role given to jon voight . runaway train uses a mix of diverse elements to create a highly- suspenseful whole . we see a microcosm of humanity at its most base and noble through them , as their desperate circumstances drive them to acts of terrible brutality and surprising heroism . runaway train closes with an apt quote from shakespeare's  richard iii  that reinforces another of the film's themes about the animalistic nature of human beings :  no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity . but i know none , and therefore am no beast .  the most electric scene of the film takes place around the three- quarters mark , and reveals key , primal aspects of each individual's personality .  i thought you was my friend ! don't make me kill you , manny !  shouts buck . it's a raw moment that not only keeps us on the edge of our seat , but gives us real insight into how these characters react in such dire circumstances . the three lead actors all give strong performances , and are ably assisted by a solid supporting cast . jon voight captivates in one of the most memorable screen roles of his distinguished career , imbuing manny with both a fierce energy and a surprisingly keen intellect . this is definitely not a common , stereotypical criminal . when runaway train was produced , the action genre was undergoing a change from character-driven movies to pyrotechnics-based flicks . of the thrillers developed after this one , only a select few -- die hard and perhaps one or two others -- have achieved this level of tautness without compromising the intelligence of the plot . it is just as compelling today as it was during the winter of 1985-86 . - ingmar bergman ",1,2.0056561331799995e-109,0.998193979582,0.00180602041818
"director : peter hewitt . mpaa rating : pg ( mild vulgarity ) running time : 83 minutes . the borrowers is the kind of goofy charmer of a family adventure film hollywood should be able to make it its sleep , if only it would bother . the premise posits the existence of 4-inch-tall beings called borrowers who live beneath the floorboards and in the walls of human homes , making their living off the bits and pieces we always seem to be misplacing -- a loose button for a plate here , a sock for a bed there . first : why can't more films employ special effects with the borrowers' unobtrusive whimsy ? visual effects supervisor peter chiang , production designer gemma jackson and cinematographers john fenner and trevor brooker have joined forces to fashion a warm , visually enthralling world for the film's characters , in which the oversized props and camera trickery serve a purpose besides calling attention to themselves . humans and borrowers interact convincingly , creating wild and thoroughly entertaining set pieces . it's a great-looking , lively piece of work with neat bits of throwaway business -- a monopoly card hung on the clocks' wall like a pop art showpiece -- and a crisp pace . the second , more disspiriting question : when and why did it become obligatory for every children's film to aim for cheap chuckles from bodily functions ? for most of its running time , the borrowers' slapstick comedy is disarming in its cartoonish innocence -- foam in the face , cheese on the head , exaggerated electrocutions and pratfalls . why , then , do we need to see peagreen immersed in a massive pile of dog droppings ? why the running gag about a flatulent hound ? is it really so difficult to fill 83 minutes with entertainment a parent can share with a child sans embarassment ? there's so much immagination throughout the borrowers that it's even more disappointing to find it swinging so typically below the belt . there's nothing particularly ground-breaking about the basic story-line of the borrowers , which melds the recent mouse hunt with a teen alienation sub-plot as arietty longs to find other borrowers . the appeal of the film comes not from narrative wackiness , but from the complementary pairing of john goodman's snarling villainy with the storybook delights of the film's overall look and feel . sure , it stumbles occasionally in the ways its most like most ostensibly  family films  of recent years . it's the ways in which the borrowers is least like its genre cousins which should make it satisfying matinee viewing . this is fantasy escapism which doesn't make you feel stupid for escaping . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line  subscribe  .

"a poorly made thriller , reeking from conventionality and lacking real suspense . it is played as a revenge film about a framed housewife who aims to get even with her slimy husband , but on the way to the film's payoff , the action is dull and unconvincing . all the characters are emotionally uninvolving . the script was lifeless and everything about the story seemed contrived , not to mention that there were huge holes in the plot . she looked so dolled up and refreshed , that it was hard to believe she was not at a country club , and those jailbird ladies getting her hip to doing underhanded things , like running traces on missing people , weren't just the sweetest dolls in the world . i felt as if i was watching a movie done by the numbers , as it plodded through every scene as if the film was being made for a film school class , while the film seemed alive only in its moments of action . the film makes a big deal about this in its plot , but when it comes time to have the payoff go that way , it chicken outs to convention and ends its story in the usual way tv crime stories end . in conventional films like this one , someone who rails against the common man's lack of art knowledge , deserves to be cast as the villain . the story made little sense , but if you are looking for some bright spot in the film , try the quaint new orleans cemetery as a pivotal background setting that helped magnify the suspense of the story . that location scene is all i enjoyed about this rather trivial and commercially made suspense film . no viewer should mistake it for a hitchcock and have to receive a scolding for that mistake by some film critic snob .

"the result was one of the year's most hilarious motion pictures . this gay romantic comedy was sly , irreverent , and even a little sentimental , but , because the lead character ( played by wings star steven weber ) was a homosexual , mainstream audiences did not embrace the movie . this one offers bigger laughs , more subversive humor , and a better-known cast . it is surely one of the year's best pure comedies , but it remains to be seen whether kevin kline , matt dillon , joan cusack , and tom selleck have enough star power to draw mixed crowds to a film whose subject has traditionally made many straight males uncomfortable . those who stay away from in and out because it addresses homosexual issues ( albeit in a light fashion ) are missing an intelligent , funny motion picture . from the very first scene , you know that in and out has struck a rich satirical vein . director frank oz has photographed greenleaf as a place with a gauzy , fairy tale-like quality that , along with some very pointed dialogue , gently pokes fun at cherished , leave it to beaver impressions of the  ideal  community . unlike david lynch , who has repeatedly attacked this image in his films , oz and rudnick are content to have a little affectionate fun with it ( much like christopher guest did in waiting for guffman ) . everyone , including howard , is shocked by the statement . in and out has a thinking person's script , and , as such , works on several levels . it can be seen as a light comedy , a biting satire , and/or a morality play that uses humor to examine society's approach to sexual identities . in and out definitely isn't a pointless comedy of the dumb and dumber variety -- it deals with issues in a shrewd manner , using a creative and well-written script to camouflage with wit any preaching . gay roles and stereotypes aren't the only subject tackled by in and out . the film also takes a number of pointed shots at various aspects of pop culture ( hollywood , the oscars , television tabloid shows , supermodels , etc . ) . the ending includes a wonderful spoof of the climax of spartacus . and the film is peppered with top-notch one-liners , the best of which come during the mock oscar telecast where cameron wins his statue . the actors all do fine jobs . tom selleck gives one of his best big- screen performances by playing against type . this is a rare ,  feel good  motion picture that doesn't insult our intelligence while making its play for our emotions . regardless of your opinion of the gay community , in and out is more than worth an evening's admission -- provided , of course , that you like to laugh .

"it's the movie that everyone feared , incorrectly as it turned out , that titanic would be -- a big , expensive special effects extravaganza without a heart . and it's the kind of movie that leaves viewers angry for wasting incredible amounts of their time with such drivel . you'll laugh . you'll cry . you'll undoubtedly laugh out loud at its many sappy moments of ridiculous hokum . and you probably at least feel like crying that such an important event in our country's history has been turned into a silly romance with one clich ? d line after another . what a colossal wasted opportunity . buy the popcorn and go for the big tub . you'll need something to do as you wait forever for the movie to get to its raison d' ? tre , the destruction of most of the united states's navy at pearl harbor . all of the characters are reduced to stereotypes so that you'll likely care little when tragedy strikes them . even the movie's sex scene , which is shot with a soap commercial gloss , is laughable . sometimes the film gets so over-the-top that you begin to wonder if it is an intentional parody of a wartime romance . the trite dialog includes such gems as ,  you don't dogfight with a manual ,   if i had one more night to live , i'd want to spend it with you ,   all i ever wanted was to have a home and grow old together ,  and  good huntin' .  after most such lines , the music is brought up dramatically . the movie , with its heavy , syrupy score , frequently seems more like a music video than a movie . the trailer scenes form the body of the movie's only successful part , the half-hour section that occurs just past the midpoint in this endurance contest of a picture -- it's over three hours long . my advice to you is to arrive ninety minutes late since nothing , absolutely nothing , of interest happens until the japanese zeros arrive to obliterate our fleet . what , you will be asking yourself frequently during this period , does this all have to do with pearl harbor ? and , as you twiddle your thumbs waiting for something to happen , you'll keep asking yourself ,  why does this story have to be over three hours long ?  which brings us to the movie's most intriguing revelation . in a fascinating bit of revisionist history , the movie has the japanese leader explain how they were forced into it . kind of makes you wonder what insights a bruckheimer story about hitler would divulge about his real motives . if you're willing to put up with the saccharine nonsense of the first half , the movie's middle section -- a cgi tour de force -- will send chills up your spine as our boys are almost completely annihilated and sent to watery graves in which many still lie . the computer generated effects are awesome , which is a good argument for seeing a film about the making of pearl harbor .  i'm not going to make it ,  one of the brave soldiers says at the end . i know just how he feels . i barely made it through the long ordeal of watching the movie . it is rated pg-13 for sustained intense war sequences , images of the wounded , brief sensuality and some language and would be acceptable for teenagers . its pg-13 rating is quite questionable since the horrific scenes of the wartime wounded , who squirt blood everywhere , are much more intense than you'd ever expect to find in a pg-13 film . in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word  subscribe  in the subject line .

"for those who think that foreign-language films must always be pretentious and lugubrious , combination platter provides a pointed counterexample . although this is not an entirely chinese movie ( it takes place in flushing , new york , and approximately forty percent of the dialogue is in english ) , the presence of frequent subtitles will argue otherwise as far as most casual movie-goers are concerned . most movies are designed as methods of escapism , opening windows on lifestyles and stories that , whether momentous or not , are generally unfamiliar to the bulk of the audience . once in a while , however , a film manages to capture the essence of a familiar reality , and its attention to detail can make viewing the commonplace a highly-entertaining experience . combination platter is such a motion picture . helped immeasurably by yoshifumi hosoya's 16 mm camerawork and filmed in a restaurant owned by the director's family , tony chan's motion picture seems almost like a documentary . his dialogue is earthy , his characters have the  feel  of real people , and his comedy is natural ( as opposed to the often-contrived and artificial humor of most films ) . granted , there aren't any scenes in combination platter that will cause audience members to roll in the aisles with laughter , but the movie's sardonic wit will provoke chuckles aplenty . ever wonder what it's like behind-the-scenes at a restaurant ? combination platter gives an uncompromisingly accurate view , broadening its scope beyond the daily grind at the szechuan inn to follow one of the characters , robert , home . his quest to find a wife could be ( and has been ) the premise for romantic comedies , but tony chan handles this situation much differently than a green card . by using a uncommon setting and not dwelling on the potentially-downbeat elements of the situation , mr . chan succeeds at this difficult task . one might wonder what could be so fascinating about spending eighty-odd minutes with the employees of a chinese restaurant ? fortunately , it doesn't take long for the script and actors to answer that question . combination platter is light entertainment , a motion picture  snack  of sorts . and speaking of food , it might be best to see this film on a full stomach , lest you may find yourself leaving the theater for the nearest establishment offering moo goo gai pan .

"catherine keener , a normally interesting actress , has nothing to do in this role but whine and act drab . cage , at all times seems wooden , never relaxed in the role . it makes one nervous just watching him trying to act a role he can't seem to get the handle on . it just never came off that way , and for a number of reasons , not the least of them being , was that cage wasn't right for the part and that he was never seen in a reflective moment undergoing a life change . the dramatics here seemed misplaced , as if they were intended more for one of the director's batman flicks , something the director brought more life to than he did with this film . but this time the look seems artificial and not well-placed , as cage is not really an introspective person , he is just someone trying to make a better life for himself at a job he is good at . and that is the main problem with the film , it has a false gritty noir look to it . this film is not the real deal , it's ersatz . therefore it never works on the intellect , instead it attacks the emotions and cheapens its efforts by pretending to delve into cage's angst . even the credible camera work , which seems too sharp-edged for the film , works against it , because it is so much better than the story and the weak acting , that it highlights even more , how artificial the film seems . the heavies of the film are all personifications of pure evil . there is nothing good about them . poole is the contact and distributor of the film . velvet is the tacky artist ; he makes the films . velvet is considered to be the jim jarmusch of s&m films . the results are as gratituous as any found in a myriad of cheap adventure films that appeal to a ready made audience , not looking for a thinking picture . the box office mistake of this film , is that it took itself seriously , somehow believing itself a thinking picture , and thereby lost both types of audiences . because those who enjoy the exploitive gore films , must have found something lacking here also , like just enough thinking to turn them off from the film . the film had perhaps one line in it that didn't seem phony , when the masked killer is unmasked and says ,  the things i do--i do them because i like them . because i want to . i wasn't abused as a child . i don't hate my parents .

"in hollywood , the place where paradigms reign and conceptual blockbusting goes to die , among the most hallowed of paradigms is the 90 minute running time . you may be able to get away with 85 , and five or ten fewer for an animated feature , but anything less would appear to risk rending the very fabric of space-time . never mind that a popular 45-minute film , with its potential for nine or ten cut-rate showings a day plus concession sales from twice as many intermissions , would be an exhibitor's fantasy . the 90-minute mandate exists for one fairly obvious , and fairly depressing , reason : it's less complicated for studios to keep throwing money at bloated , mediocre films than it is for them to figure out how to make and market shorter , better ones . nothing to lose could have been a hilarious 30 or 40 minutes of comic film-making . instead , it's an over-stuffed 97 minutes , not because it should have been but because it _had_ to be . along the way , writer-director steve oedekerk places nick and t . paul into some bizarre and truly inventive situations . at odd moments , nothing to lose will catch you off guard with a memorable supporting performance or an unpredictable punch line . since oedekerk is a veteran of stand-up comedy and sketch writing for  in living color ,  it should be surprising that hit-and-run gags play to his strengths . nor should it be surprising that the length of a feature film does not . he fills the spaces between clever comic moments with sub-plots which probably were meant to provide  depth ,  but instead merely provide  length .  this lame attempt at social commentary robs both characters of the edge which would have made a shorter , sharper nothing to lose crackle with creativity . tim robbins as just another uptight liberal-in-training is a bore . martin lawrence as a sympathetic family man is a strain on credulity like a tractor-trailer is a strain on a vespa . ninety-seven minutes gives him too much time to search for a happy ending , one which would have been much happier for all involved if it had come an hour earlier . calling a critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist .

"john ford's epic western about america and its racial past , is the quintessential american film about what it once meant to be american , more than any other film that i could think of , and that includes citizen kane . it is ford's best , one that is much more than the western it appears to be ; it is a film that is eventually about self-discovery , seen symbolically through the eyes of one man , john wayne . there is not one single actor in the world who could have played this part better than wayne . in the opening scene , he is only there briefly and does not feel very comfortable in that short stay , even when idolized by the children . ethan does not belong to either the white settlers or the indians . that he hates indians so much , yet speaks their language and feels comfortable with their ways , more so than he does with white society , makes it difficult to figure why he has so much hatred for them . his story is visceral poetry , a tragedy that turns ridiculous , as ford wanted it to be , and it has unexpected psychological twists to it that can be read into the story by one's own relationship with america . it is hard not to substitute his hatred for indians into a hatred for blacks , and it is easy to see how wayne's soul could be construed as america's soul . make no mistake about it , this is not an ordinary or very good western , this is undoubtedly a masterpiece of american cinema , one that many of the early 1950s film critics couldn't see . it is not that it is a particularly profound movie , but it is one that caught the emotions and the metaphors of a rich country with a paradoxical past and an intangible future . over-the-years , the status of this film has grown immeasurably , to the point that its anti-hero hero is now a fixture on the cinematic scene , along with the recognition that ford has created a work that searches deeply into a man's interior and into the country's consciousness . if there was a more perceptive western made , one that captured the visions of america better , i have not seen such a film . if there is such a film out there , i will take the liberty of using wayne's favorite retort in the film :  that'll be the day .

"screenplay : deborah kaplan and harry elfont . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 96 minutes . deborah kaplan and harry elfont have commented that one of the reasons they made can't hardly wait was that  nobody was making those good john hughes teen comedies any more .  that's probably why can't hardly wait feels so much like a greatest hits compilation , peppered with recognizable elements from the entire hughes oeuvre of the mid-80s and a dozen other teen comedies of the last 25 years for good measure . that's one hefty dose of deja-vu , enough to overwhelm most films this slight . fortunately , kaplan and elfont prove as adept at entertaining as they are at reminiscing . can't hardly wait may be familiar and predictable , but it's never out-and-out dumb , and at times it's surprisingly funny . the appealing cast features solid work from lauren ambrose as vulnerable wiseacre denise and seth green as a tries-too-hard homeboy with whom she ends up locked in a bathroom . some of the forced whimsy does fall flat ( notably jenna elfman's cameo as an  angel  offering advice to the lovelorn preston ) , and kaplan and elfont probably toss a few too many pop culture references on the fire . for once , however , the problems in a teen comedy spring from over-writing rather than under-writing . if there's one noteworthy hole in can't hardly wait , it's the central plot of preston's pursuit of amanda . ethan embry is pleasant enough in an unrequited puppy-dog way , but this is the kind of role john cusack defined a decade ago ; you root for preston not because his entire demeanor sells his longing , but because the machinations of the plot point you in that direction . of all the plot threads running through can't hardly wait , theirs is by far the least interesting , though it's the one inevitably destined to provide the happy ending . still , it's hard not to find charms in a teen comedy that's lively , moderately intelligent and effective in its portrayal of high school social dynamics . it also features a wonderfully eclectic soundtrack which runs the gamut from guns 'n' roses to smashmouth , from third eye blind to run-dmc , from parliament to the title tune by the replacements . can't hardly wait even manages to include a bit of social commentary in its adolescent craziness , promoting environmental awareness , safe sex and responsible drinking and driving behavior . sure , the latter is emphasized when party attendees drop their car keys into a bowl , which is yet another detail swiped from say anything . can't hardly wait shows off its antecedents unabashedly , and still comes up with something satisfying on its own level . looks like john hughes didn't have to worry about telling a generation of movie-goers  don't you forget about me .  see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line  subscribe  .

"undoubtedly impressed by the long-term , consistent profitability of paramount's star trek movies ( the ninth of which will be released this year ) , new line has decided to resurrect another late-'60s science fiction television enterprise , lost in space . star trek was a relatively serious , socially-conscious series while lost in space became infected with what i'll call the  batman sickness ,  and , over the course of its four-year run , devolved from a semi-straight program into pure camp . much of that silliness has been removed for this big-budget , big-screen effort . fans of the original lost in space will likely not be displeased by the direction this movie takes . unfortunately , there's not much to supplement all the eye-popping visuals . the story is unfocused and the character development is virtually nonexistent . one of the problems is that lost in space uses more than 30 minutes setting up the plot , and it's not a particularly interesting half-hour . ( if a strong box office response warrants future installments , at least we will have gotten over this tedious hurdle . ) the set design in lost in space is impressive . the interior of the space ship is suitably futuristic-looking , while the earth-based scenes , with their visually-stunning backdrops , recall last year's the fifth element . most of the model sequences are equally flawless , but the computer-generated spider-like aliens have the same flaw exhibited by similar creatures in starship troopers ? they look fake . too bad some of the effects money wasn't spent on the script . lost in space is infected with a meandering storyline and lifeless protagonists . without a clear narrative drive , there doesn't seem to be much of a point to the whole endeavor . the desire to get home doesn't generate the level of urgency one might reasonably expect , and the movie ends up feeling like a few episodes of star trek : voyager strung together . there isn't a clear villain , either , since dr . smith is more of an anti-hero than anything else ? his motivation is self-interest , not malice . smith becomes a fascinating blend of charisma and delicious nastiness . beyond oldman , however , the cast is disappointingly bland . heather graham , who was wonderful as rollergirl in boogie nights , fails to do anything interesting with judy . chabert especially shows spunk , but she has the least screen time of the major players . incidentally , it could be argued that it wouldn't have mattered if everyone in the cast had been in peak acting form , since the script delivers the kind of two-dimensional characters involved in shallow relationships that even top-notch performances couldn't do much with . lost in space features a few action sequences that generate adrenaline jolts , but this is not an edge-of-the-seat motion picture . this may add to the film's attraction in some quarters , but not as far as i'm concerned . i wanted a little more energy and a story that went somewhere . as a result , while i can offer a mild endorsement of lost in space as a comic book come to life , it's too weak a film for me to stamp with an unqualified recommendation .  my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down .  -- david puttnam ",2,0.0103062605603,0.0013559367789000001,0.988337802661

"the sweet hereafter is film maker atom egoyan's most compelling movie to date . amplifying many of the themes explored in his previous outing , exotica , the canadian director/writer/producer shows the powerful effects of grief and anger on a community devastated by an unspeakable tragedy . during the course of this 110-minute , emotionally- turbulent experience , egoyan doesn't ask any easy questions or propose any pat answers . this is film making at its most powerful : drama capable of shaking the soul , yet free of even the slightest hint of manipulation , sentimentality , or mawkishness . the movie has an impact that extends far beyond the walls of a movie theater ? a quality shared by a distressingly few of today's releases . egoyan began making films with 1984's next of kin , a critical success that earned him a nomination for canada's best director genie award . he followed next of kin with family viewing , speaking parts , the adjuster , and calendar , all of which shared certain common traits , including a wildly elliptical style , themes of emotional isolation , and a degree of distance between the characters and the audience . egoyan's early movies , although intellectually stimulating and fascinating to observe from a critical standpoint , were emotionally dissatisfying . however , the director's next effort , the much-lauded exotica , broke down the character/audience barrier , and , at the time , proved to be egoyan's most challenging effort . yet , as forceful as exotica was , it was only an appetizer for the sweet hereafter . as with all of the other egoyan-directed movies , the sweet hereafter involves more than one storyline , although the internal connections are less oblique here than in the previous features . this could easily be viewed as egoyan's most commercial work thus far . it is certainly his most accessible . there are those who would equate words like  commercial  and  accessible  with the term  creative compromise ,  but nothing could be further from the truth . although egoyan's methods may have become more mainstream , his message is richer and more complex than ever . the scene of the bus sinking into the water ? a stark , simple shot ? is one of the most painfully effective and disturbing sequences in any film this year . the impact is further enhanced by presenting the fatal moment from the perspective of an impotent father . death has become such a cheap , bloody commodity in modern movies that viewing a scene like this is a revelation . since egoyan eschews linear storytelling by allowing time to be fluid rather than fixed , we don't see the actual accident until midway through the movie . the sweet hereafter is based on the novel by russell banks , but egoyan has infused it with his own inimitable style . the most intriguing character is mitchell . the best-developed of all of the sweet hereafter's numerous multifaceted individuals , mitchell proves to be a sympathetic figure even though his influence is negative . as always , egoyan has assembled a top-notch cast . ian holm paints a powerful and stirring portrait of mitchell as a haunted , hurting figure whose inner torment touches our hearts . it is during this scene , more than any other , that the audience truly connects with a character that , under other circumstances , might be worthy of disdain . most of the other performers are egoyan regulars . in addition to portraying nicole , polley contributes the vocals to many of the songs heard throughout the film , including the one that plays over the closing credits . one of the many tangential aspects of the sweet hereafter is to illustrate the shallowness of the numerous john grisham movies . compared to egoyan's thoughtful and potent examination of the role of a lawyer in society , even the rainmaker , the best adaptation of a grisham novel to date , seems flat and unconvincing . egoyan has given us a powerful motion picture that resonates on every level . the most amazing thing about the sweet hereafter is not the style , the acting , or the cinematography ( all of which are exceptional ) , but the way the film successfully juggles so many themes , persuading us to reflect upon them all before the 110 minute running time is up . this is truly a great film ? easily one of 1997's best .  for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake .

"if the score of immortal beloved is remarkable , that of the madness of king george is no less so . with the clear strains of handel's  water music  and  zadok the priest  in the background , the madness of king george ascends to a level that it might never have attained using a modern composer . the musical selections ( made by george fenton ) are so perfectly and expertly interwoven into the film that one might easily assume the score had been specifically written for nicholas hytner's production . the doctors--mostly a bunch of jumped-up quacks--do nothing for him . the madness of king george is much more than a simple study of one man's descent into insanity . with a style that's more tongue-in-cheek than melodramatic , the film is always witty and occasionally satirical . medical historians are generally agreed that the cause of george's madness was something called porphyria , an acute , intermittent , hereditary disease that is physical ( rather than mental ) in nature . the king's symptoms , including blue urine and gastric crises , match those of porphyria , although some have postulated that there may have been a secondary affliction , such as manic-depression , involved . whatever the case , as this film illustrates , it's clear that there were times when george was unfit to rule . another constantly takes the king's pulse . a third advocates examining the royal chamberpots--the stool being  more eloquent than the pulse .  only dr . willis , with his hypnotic gaze , gives the impression of competence . without exception , the acting is top-notch . the four principles--hawthorne , mirren , holm , and everett--do fine jobs . hawthorne's performance is especially noteworthy , allowing us to understand , and occasionally even sympathize , with a decidedly arrogant and dislikable personality . despite allusions to king lear , this movie's strength is in its story breadth , not its depth . a lot happens here , but few of the themes take root beyond their surface meaning . adapted from the play the madness of george iii , the film trims copious portions of dialogue , leaving behind a tightly-paced picture that has the feel of something created for the screen rather than for the stage . certain subplots are watered down or eliminated , but what survives is more than enough to keep king george a source of solid entertainment .

"the opening credits of dangerous beauty , thankfully , say the story is true -- it's based on margaret rosenthal's biography  the honest courtesan .  were it not true , as it claims to be so , the frequently ridiculous , silly plot would have had the audiences laughing at all the wrong places . we learn , for example , that most women of that era , with the exception of courtesans , were not able to read . for those of you who have trouble suspending disbelief in movies , this film may short-circuit your brain . jeannine dominy's screenplay adaptation takes a modern language approach , laced with poetry , that might be termed shakespeare-lite , so there are ample opportunities to ridicule the picture if you are so inclined . but don't get me wrong , as filmed in a romantic haze by bojan bazelli and as sumptuously decorated by norman garwood , the production dazzles the eyes at every turn . even more dazzling and bizarre is the film's opening . ( this much nudity so early in a picture is not a good sign . ) the script likes to include advice , witty and bawdy . the movie has the potential to become a camp classic . although the costumes look authentic , especially the ridiculous eight-inch platform shoes that the courtesans wear , the simple make-up looks exactly like what you see on the street today . she has a book published of her poetry and engages the men in duels of poetry , sometimes lewd but more often not . as absurd as it is at times , the movie , directed by marshall herskovitz from the tv series  my so-called life ,  can be quite cute . and with its full plate of romance , jealousy , humor , titillation and even a bit of pathos , it tries to please everyone . but the ending scene , which you've seen a hundred times before , neatly wraps it all up . although parts of the picture are enjoyable , the characters never rise above playacting . like some ribald tale from the playboy channel but with most of the sex scenes edited out , the movie is never sure what it wants to be . it's certainly not soft porn , but neither is it is very substantial . it is rated r for nudity , sex and profanity and would be acceptable for teenagers if they are both older and mature .

"the merchant ivory film a soldier's daughter never cries is a richly textured series of sketches pasted into an inviting , cinematic picture book . based on kaylie jones's novel of an expatriate family living in paris in the 1960s and 1970s , the story starts slowly as it introduces its characters , but it eventually weaves a strong spell on the audience . he voices controversial opinions that sometimes make sense and other times don't . except for these relatively weak characters , the movie is fully fleshed out . both actresses deliver wonderfully complex and winning performances . the realistic portrayal of channe's life and loves has incidents and characters just quirky enough to mimic real life without being too outlandish . the script by james ivory and ruth prawer jhabvala has the good sense to avoid the obvious scenes . instead , the script leads us into a heart-warming christmas tree trimming scene . the most original and intriguing character in the movie is the teenage channe's best friend , francis fortescue . francis , played by real-life operatic singer anthony roth costanzo in his first acting role , isn't channe's boyfriend per se , even if he'd like to be . his passion is opera , and his high-pitched voice is phenomenal . teenagers should all have such a wonderful friend as francis . having made us feel like part of the family , we become deeply but subtly moved by this last third of the picture . since they are viewed as weird , they act the part . the story , which gets to you in ways that are hard to explain , reminds us of the fragility of life and of the need to take the time to be with our loved ones , while they're still with us . and it teaches us about the need for friendships , both romantic and platonic . the first part of the film is partially in french with english subtitles . it is rated r for a little profanity and for mature situations and would be fine for teenagers .

"the best part of the film , is that it did capture the east village feel of the reagan 1980s . but , for the most part , this was a dull film that had nothing to say and soon wore out its welcome as the story became insipid and the characters grating . in the end , the film proved to be as shallow as the characters were . director risa bramon garcia , making her debut after a successful career as a casting director , seems to be more interested in getting the pop music of the 1980s heard and the bizarre dress of party goers viewed , than in telling a cohesive story . in this ensemble piece , there are far too many characters to really get to know them and too many sub plot developments to keep your interest . everyone fades in and out of the scene , for no rhyme or reason , each with some tale to tell .  if you relax , you can get what you want , even if you smell like dog shit .  the film is almost bearable when it just goes for the look and feel of the times , but when it tries to pontificate , such as when it sums up the film by comparing relationships to the way smokers have a need for cigarettes , and asks the question from the pair that got the most screen time , rudd and love ,  why are people so scared of each other ? then i felt the party was really over and this mtv produced story faded out with not one interesting character in the film . i bet you a dollar to a donut , that you could have gone to most any other new year's eve party in manhattan and met more interesting people !

"happiness is not a film about happiness , because happiness is not real but imagined , therefore no one can stay happy in a world where sadness is the more prevalent emotional state . so goes the theme of this dark comedy , meant to shock and antagonize you into looking at people you cannot readily identify with , in a film that features a pedophile rapist ( dylan ) , a murderer ( camyrn ) , an obscene caller ( hoffman ) , a masturbator ( read ) , a russian immigrant thief ( jared ) , and an assortment of losers and lonely people wrapped up in their egos , as solondz's morbid sense of humor turns to new jersey's suburbs to explore the depravity of the human race . this is an honestly made film that refuses to compromise on its plot or who should be cast in it ( solondz refused the studio's offer to cast the pedophile with a noted star such as , william hurt , because he felt dylan was just right for the role ) . this film is meant for an art house type of audience , one that is able , as difficult as it may be , to see something in themselves in the characters portrayed on screen . i would wonder about anyone who could sit through this film and not be disturbed by it , that would just defeat its purpose . the audience i saw this film with , were mostly williams college students and faculty , and they laughed openly and freely at the parts that had an edge to it , where solondz was going for the laugh because he pushed the button as far as he wanted to go with a certain character and , in order to return to the intensely grim psychological mood of the story , he had to release some humorous energy or have the film drown in its own murky waters . the laughter was appropriate , and even  hip ,  as it felt right to see this with an audience that still felt the need to be entertained when they go to the movies , and it didn't seem to matter if the laughter came about from the cruel humor it evoked , causing people to react as a group rather than individually . i found that most people in the audience appeared to be nervously silent ; and , there was at no time just one person alone laughing ( but , the best part , is that only one person walked out of the theater and no one hissed ) . happiness is a difficult picture to watch , there are no good guys or gals . the sisters all suffer from ego-centredness , and it takes an audience with a modicum of sympathy for each of them to get past all the vices each of them has , as each one in this story only pretends to be interested in anyone but themselves . this is a very solid film , that is well-acted , that is understandably not for everyone , yet because it takes risks on subjects that are tabu , and even though some of the risks seemed contrived and not a part of the natural story line , this is still a powerful film , one deserving of attention and intelligent critique , one deserving of thanks from those of us who welcome a true effort for the sake of art , even if the art has to sink into the mud to have its story told . many filmmakers have approached the subject of happiness by tacking on a happy ending to their films . that is not the case with this film , obviously . this film leaves you little choice , you can take this film as morbid and amusing as it is , or you can ignore it , or you can find no one in it that you feel some sort of compassion for , and therefore come to hate it . i came close to loving it , while not exactly loving it , mainly because there were too many scenes in it that left me with mixed feelings and messages . but close to loving it , means i liked it a lot for its honesty to subject matter and character . i did , however , think that these characters went too far in their portrayals for me to relate to them without either feeling sorry for them or despising them . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net ",2,8.042516480049999e-35,2.35600195503e-10,0.999999999764
"the australians have a knack for screwball comedies that are actually funny . american filmmakers too often confuse humor with bad taste . writer and director gerard lee's 1995 film all men are liars was a box office sensation in australia . i saw it at san jose's cinequest film festival . since i said it was an australian comedy , you might leap to the conclusion that the film was about cross-dressing . if you did , you'd be right . all men are liars is funny , sweet , and romantic . i'll outline the main action , but there are more subplots than you can count . you are likely to leave the show arguing with your friends about what part was the best . let me state my opinion upfront . both are wonderful actors , and they make it is easy for the audience to live their romance vicariously . it is sugar week in a small-town in the middle of nowhere in australia . jarratt has one of the best parts of the film and manages to steal most of the scenes he is in . it is a family heirloom of hers , and if the piano goes , she goes too . other than the delicious in-joke about the piano , irene's whole part only serves to slow down the action and should have been eliminated . campion's signature film is the piano , so having a piano play a promenade role in lee's picture was no accident . you can probably guess the basic structure of the rest of the story , but the beauty is in the details . most of them are small but delightful , with the best little scene dominated by larry , the boys' pet lizard . the moral of this vignette is don't take a lizard on a date . david price is terrific as michelle . their romance is delightful and innocent -- from the classic scene where they almost skinny-dip to the one of michelle changing clothes off-screen . both of the leads are lovable , and the script has just enough poignancy in it to make you care and worry about them . there are some fun musical numbers too . toni pearen is a popular singer in australia , and i liked her naturalness much better than the constant mugging for the camera that was prevalent in a recent all-musical movie that i endured . the script is smart and upbeat . it works more by its character development and its joke setups than by its one-liners . still , i remember the line of the local stud . the stud's pathetic cry is ,  if i need therapy for this , you're paying for it .  a show with a great ending , and one that leaves a song in your heart and a contagious feeling of joy . in australia it was rated pg , but has not been rated by our mpaa . i suspect it will get a pg or a pg-13 rating . there is a brief shot of rear male nudity , and i think there may have been a little profanity that i forgot to record in my notes . the show should be fine for kids ten and up . i loved this little gem and recommend it to you . i give the film * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : january 31 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"so what are the christmas traditions at your home ? at ours , for as long as i can remember , we have curled up on the sofa and watched dr . in the middle of a frantic christmas season , there is no better respite from the buy-me commercialism of the holidays than this short , but poignant story by dr . seuss . and there are few children's authors as literate and imaginative as the great dr . seuss . it is a shame that more of his works have not been made into movies or at least televised shorts . t . for which he wrote the screenplay . his stories usually rhyme . his arguments are convincing ones . will ever again be satisfied with the twenty-six puny little letters we have in english . as he so amply demonstrates , there are so many words that just can not be spelled with them . the grinch is narrated by the great boris karloff . his rich and powerful voice dominates the film . his villain is mean enough to be real without being too scary , thus giving us a film which can be enjoyed by three year olds as well as eighty-three year olds . although he speaks his lines , his voice is so melodious that it is singing to my ears . the animation is minimalist , but heartwarming . it has all the looks of an inexpensive production for television , which it was , but do not be fooled by its low cost exterior . this is a film with a big heart that manages never to be sappy no matter how familiar the story may sound . called whoville , it is populated with normal rockwell style cartoon figures . typical is little cindy lou who ,  who is no more than two ,  and who has a smile that would melt butter . the morose grinch has a sweet little dog . one look at the dog , and it is love at first sight for the audience . the songs by albert hague are as hokey as can be , but still lovable . this is an old children's show , so you have to give it a little leeway . the absolutely predictable ending is none the less effective . maybe christmas , he thought , means a little bit more .  it is not rated but would get a g . there is nothing offensive or scary in it . it is an ideal show for all ages at christmas . my son jeffrey , age 7 1/2 , my wife , and i all recommend it to you strongly . the world would be a better place if everyone would ponder its clear message . i give the grinch * * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"regret to inform is the moving , but frustrating , documentary that she made about her experience as well as those of various american and vietnamese widows . handsomely filmed by emiko omori , daniel reeves and nancy schiesari , the images make the tragic story palpable . silly as it might seem , when a section of the vietnam memorial was shown , i tried hard to catch a glimpse of some of the names of my friends who perished . not to do so would have felt like a disservice to them . civil wars , like those in vietnam or korea in which the us chose to participate , have at best a fleeting glory . movies such as regret to inform keep these important memories alive . the significant downside to regret to inform is that it is essentially a propaganda piece since its views are completely one-sided . sonneborn turns a gut-wrenchingly complex situation into a simplistically easy one . she points out that the people of vietnam call it the american war , as if that were a major revelation . if you know nothing about the war ( many of the kids in our schools today know little ) , then this documentary would leave you with two strong impressions . first , the barbaric americans invaded a helplessly agrarian society for no obvious purpose . although we hear again and again about all of the wrongs that the americans committed , never do we hear anything about the vietnam civil war , communism vs . democracy or the vietnamese atrocities against the americans . documentarians can produce good movies even if they are slanted . regret to inform does this , for which it should be commended . it is not rated but would be pg-13 for some war footage and would be fine for kids around 12 and up .

"the first thing to note about waiting to exhale , forest whitaker's theatrical feature debut as a director , is that it will likely be a huge success with its target audience . many black women will see themselves in this motion picture , and , subconsciously using their personal background to fill in gaps left by the screenplay , they will declare this film a triumph . i wish i could be as positive with my opinion , but i found waiting to exhale to be seriously flawed -- a string of connected vignettes that propel the four main characters along easily predicted character arcs . of the quartet of stories , bernadine's is the most compelling . it's no coincidence that this character is played by angela bassett , the best actress in the cast . needless to say , bernadine doesn't react well to this news and her response -- torching his car with all his possessions in it -- will almost certainly garner loud cheers from women in the audience . although not as interesting as bernadine , loretta devine's gloria offers some worthwhile moments . waiting to exhale's other two characters -- savannah ( whitney houston ) and robin ( lela rochon ) -- are basically separate aspects of the same personality . neither of these stories is of more than passing interest , and the movie slows to a crawl when houston or rochon takes center stage . whitaker's direction , like the tone , is uneven . some of the switches from comedy to drama are forced and abrupt . that said , however , waiting to exhale contains a fair number of genuinely humorous sequences , many of which make pointed comments about male insensitivity . there are also several memorable serious scenes , the best of which team angela bassett with wesley snipes . not only does this pair sizzle , but the dialogue is intelligently-written and the performances are on- target . the most significant fault in waiting to exhale is its character presentation . with the exception of bernadine , i never felt anything for the women populating this film , as they failed to capture my interest or sympathy . part of this can be attributed to bland performances by houston and rochon , but the script must bear an equal share of the burden . no doubt about it -- this is a  women's movie  ( or , as it's alternatively referred to , a  chick flick  ) , but it's among the year's weakest . of all those films , however , this one has the most artificial and disjointed  feel  . personally , i don't buy the  male bashing  accusation that has been leveled at waiting to exhale . the treatment of men in the movie seems fine , and there are other problems more worthy of attention . given the dearth of significant roles for black women in motion pictures , it's refreshing to see these four bonding on the big screen -- and that's almost reason enough for this film to have been made . nevertheless , it's difficult to deny that another layer of substance is needed to lift the movie about this superficial level of melodrama .

"leatrice is also responsible for popularizing the bobbed hair look , which was the style of her hair for this film . this is fluff romantic/comedy that has many holes in the story ; this makes the film lacking in certain basic standards of filmmaking . it's also reflective of the 1920s male chauvinistic attitude toward women , where it can be said with a straight face by one of the main lady characters :  that a man wants beauty not brains in a woman .  and aren't you wonderful ! when he demonstrates the machine , doolittle sneakily fixes it so it splatters over all those watching the demo . it's also beyond me how the family could invite someone as devious as that into their home . but , in any case , the brainy a . b . that seems to be the way a 'feel good' movie went in those days , as it leaves the audience with a happy feeling . this same formula is still used by the hollywood film , but the film's are much more polished today . the clinging vine is not a good film by any stretch of the imagination , but it does present an historical perspective of those silent era times .

"screenplay : david howard and robert gordon . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , violence ) running time : 102 minutes . i can say without reservation that galaxy quest boasts the best mainstream  high concept  of 1999 . i started chuckling the moment i heard about a film in which the cast members of a beloved television science-fiction series -- a decade removed from any career except appearing at conventions and ribbon-cuttings -- were mistaken by an alien race for real fighters for interplanetary justice . i saw it as a wonderful opportunity both to needle the phenomenon of  star trek  fandom and to embrace its fundamental optimism . if handled properly , it could be a fun and funny adventure into the way our popular entertainments can help define our world , and define the performers who create them . i was so engaged by the concept of galaxy quest that , even as the film was unfolding , i kept cutting it slack . it's also something of a missed opportunity ( or , more specifically , a series of missed opportunities ) . screenwriters david howard and robert gordon drop in plenty of goodies for those in the  star trek  know , yet they're often more content to rely on insider gags than to flesh those gags out . a story with the potential to focus on how the actors come to terms with their legacy ultimately becomes just another comic adventure , less about the people than about the premise . oh , but that premise does make for some entertaining viewing . most of the best jokes showcase an internal logic that should be the envy of every science-fiction film : because the thermians designed the real ship after the television ship , it follows all of the show's rules . though the humor does tend towards the  insider ,  at least it's insider in a generally clever way , finding amusement even in the captain's tendency to lose his shirt during every fight scene . galaxy quest is far too lively and good-natured to deserve harsh criticism ; in a season full of prestige-hungry oscar wannabes , it's nice to see a film interested primarily in putting a smile on your face . the smiles , unfortunately , don't turn into full-fledged laughs often enough . the situations beg to have the absurdity level turned up just a notch ; the characters beg to be given more personality .  high concept  is most often used by critics as a derogatory term , but that didn't have to be the case for galaxy quest . though it may send you out of the theater chuckling , it could have taken its concept even higher . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject  subscribe  .

"de palma , whose last great film , the untouchables , was crafted over a decade ago seems to have lost his magic . in snake eyes , he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out of a skilled cast . only gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material . the rest of the actors become caricatures in this by-the-numbers thriller . ryuichi sakamoto's atmospheric and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene . heavy on the long violin notes , its rhythm is punctuated by thunder . ( the script by de palma and lost world's david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise . spouting cliched and ridiculous dialog , he screams such lines as ,  i was made for the sewer , baby !  actually the line is more apropos for the movie as a whole . but most people in the film are not who they seem to be , and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess . the plot , which is told in endless flashbacks , concerns the assassination of the secretary through a scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen ? that adjective is , of course , redundant in hollywood thrillers . although a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence , this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie . the movie's outline has some promise , but the movie itself is leaden . the film takes itself all too seriously . at best , it is a 1940s-style b movie . a little humor would have helped the script some , but a complete rewrite would have been better . and , although i hate to say it , a different director would have been the biggest improvement . it is rated r for violence and would be acceptable for teenagers .

"the joy luck club , as stated in the movie's opening narrative , is a collection of four aging chinese women bound together more by hope than by joy or luck . since i didn't count , i can't verify this statement , but it sounds about right . taken as a whole , all of these vignettes combine to lend greater meaning to the whole . the joy luck club is the sum total of its parts with common themes giving solid grounding and greater resonance to the overall film . as bass comments ,  i saw all the mothers' and daughters' stories as facets of the same experience . that's the genius of the book , and if we cut it down to just a couple of stories it would be like any other movie .  the stories are not told in such a manner as to seem pared down or truncated , nor is their presentation confusing , thanks to a cleverly- orchestrated framing scene with the principal characters gathered together . however , it is apparent that a lot more could have been told , and we're left wondering about all that we didn't get to see . the characters are mostly well-developed , but it's tantalizing to consider just how much fuller some of them could have been with a different plot structure . but there are always sacrifices to be made , and no movie can tell everything about the lives of the people it introduces . one of the themes of sleepless in seattle is that there are some  guy movies  and some  chick movies .  if this is true , then the joy luck club fits into the latter category . certainly , a tear-jerker like this is likely to find more open acceptance among women than among men . that's not necessarily because men won't like it , but some will be too embarrassed to admit that they enjoyed something as emotional as this . in fact , there are those who may refuse to see it to avoid this possible dilemma altogether . nevertheless , there will be a group of people who will genuinely dislike the joy luck club , and i can't say that their reasoning is entirely flawed . the movie has a few moments that can justifiably be described as cloying and manipulative , and those who are offended by these methods are going to become annoyed at the joy luck club . die-hard cynics are advised to stay clear . what the aforementioned people have missed , however , is that the scenes that don't work are far fewer in number than those that do , and most of these can easily be overlooked in piecing together the overall intent of the motion picture . few movies are without at least a problem or two , and it's more difficult to put together a flawless production when going for the emotional payoffs that this film does . the joy luck club is clearly--perhaps too clearly--an adaptation of a book . the dialogue is often too poetic to be real , and the story too clearly plotted to be acceptable as anything more than an imperfect reflection of the world we live in . i hasten to add that this is not a bad thing , but it is evidence that this movie , through its willingness to loosen the strings of realism , expects a certain suspension of disbelief from the audience . personally , i never identified with any of the characters , but i became involved in their stories . that is to say , never did i make a connection between something in my own life and what i was seeing on screen , but that in no way diminished the impact of what was being presented . i venture to say that many women , especially those who have had tempestuous relationships with their mothers or daughters , will have an entirely different viewpoint . the line between drama and melodrama is a fine one , and most of the joy luck club successfully navigates the tightrope , staying on the more powerful dramatic side . there are times when it slips and comes across as heavy-handed . you know something isn't right when it becomes apparent that certain lines of dialogue and character actions are trying desperately to make you , as a member of the audience , shed a tear . whether or not these incidents do what they're trying to is another matter entirely . . . . wayne wang , whose best-known previous film was dim sum , shows significant ability in the way he has structured this movie . many are played by more than one actor ( as children then adults , for example ) , but all changes are smooth and seamless . it's as easy to accept a little girl as waverly as it is the beautiful , sophisticated-looking tamlyn tomita , and that's because the characters transcend the performers portraying them . it's fascinating and satisfying the way that the diverse threads are knitted together into a single tapestry . some might complain that this movie is a downer , but those who do , fail to recognize that the joy luck club's message is one of hope , and that catharsis and emotional fulfillment often come through tragedy . sure , a lot of bad things happen during the course of this film , but at the end , the tears are of happiness and new beginnings , not loss .

's story a comedy rather than a tragedy . after every clumsy take becomes not simply a paradigm for self-delusion , but a reminder that sometimes process is as important to art as product . the sincerity with which wood speaks to welles as an equal , and his determination to stay true to his vision , make him anything but pathetic . yet burton manages to tell another story in ed wood , that of the curious friendship between ed and bela lugosi . it is truly an example of mutual need--wood needs lugosi to lend his movies credibility ; lugosi needs wood to give him work , any work--but it's also something even more touching . it is respect which is the greatest gift ed gives him , and laundau's portrayal of his slow return to humanity is one of the finest pieces of acting this year . it is ed wood's niftiest accomplishment that it links these two stories so effortlessly . ed wood's uniquely wonderful naivete comes from the fact that he never fully grasps that hollywood was a business first . he is unable to understand how lugosi could be unable to find work , because to ed , his talent is all that should matter . ed wood is occasionally quite slow-moving , and loses much of its steam in its final twenty minutes . but the affection in burton's telling of this tale is infectious , and makes one wish more talented contemporary filmmakers were as relentlessly individual .

"mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity ) running time : 121 minutes . it won't be difficult for many viewers to accept denzel washington as a character sent straight from heaven . . . particularly female viewers . washington has been a regular on  sexiest man  lists , dazzling audiences with his confident smile while building an impressive body of work in roles characterized by intensity , integrity and -- frequently -- inscrutability . yet for all his obvious talent and good looks , he has often seemed unapproachable on screen , so cool that he fails to be warm . the preacher's wife comes as a welcome addition to washington's resume , a somewhat predictable holiday confection buoyed by washington's engaging lead performance . it is equally natural to expect a certain amount of holy-rolling in such an effort , but the preacher's wife does a fairly good job of walking the fine line between sincere and sanctimonious . penny marshall ( big , awakenings ) has shown herself to be that rare contemporary director who can make a  feel-good  film which doesn't leave you feeling insulted , and she generally avoids saccharine overload . the major problem with the preacher's wife is the same problem which has characterized most of marshall's films : it's just too long . her movies have a tendency to run out of gas with a lot of film left to run , and the preacher's wife could have benefited from plenty of additional editing . much of it could have come from whitney houston's performance , which consists largely of finding reasons to break into song like elvis presley in one of his carefully crafted vehicles . houston certainly has a spectacular voice , and it is nice to hear her using it for gospel standards rather than dreary ballads , but half a dozen musical numbers simply pushes the limit and pads the running time . little justin pierre edmond should have been another strong candidate for the editor's knife ; the button-cute rascal is one of the worst child actors i have seen on screen in years . thankfully , denzel washington is on hand to provide a jolt whenever the preacher's wife needs it most . his first appearance may be a shock to those who know him best as serious , determined characters in films like malcolm x , crimson tide and courage under fire : dropped from the sky into the snow , looking decidedly dapper in a grey suit , hat and topcoat , washington's dudley proceeds to celebrate his return to corporeal form by spinning around on the ground like one of the three stooges . his innocence and earnestness are thoroughly charming , and his scenes with courtney b . vance ( effective as the real principal character of the story ) have a particular appeal . if there isn't much chemistry between washington and houston , well , that's not really the point of the preacher's wife . besides , denzel washington is a chemical reaction all by himself , and it is a pleasure to see that he can sparkle as well as he smolders .

"date released : varies running length : 1 : 45 rated : nr ( mature themes ) starring : daniel auteuil , emmanuelle beart , andre dussollier , elisabeth bourgine director : claude sautet producers : jean-louis livi and philippe carcassonne screenplay : yves ulmann , jacques fieschi , and jerome tonnere music : maurice ravel released by october films french with english subtitles often foreign films , and french films in particular , are thought of by the average movie-goer as being exceptionally ( and some would say  overly  ) intellectual . this could not be more true than for un coeur en hiver , yet it is not merely the mind that this film touches . the rich musical score ( ravel ) is a feast for the ears , and the exceptional performances of the principals leads to several emotionally-potent moments . un coeur en hiver is one of those rare films that can be described as completely satisfying . distilled to its basic essence , the movie is a story that the french do so well : the romantic triangle . beyond the premise , however , there is nothing ordinary about un coeur en hiver . theirs is definitely not a typical tale of clandestine love . rather , it is an examination of the prices of emotional honesty and emotional isolation . oddly enough , it's stephane , the character with the most screen time ( and the man whose heart is  in winter  ) who remains much the enigma to the audience . even though we come to identify with him , and understand some of what he does , the depth of his emotions often remains unclear . the last scene of the movie explicitly reveals part of the truth , but for much about stephane , the viewer must reach his or her own conclusions . daniel auteuil plays his role with ability . his is a difficult performance to make succeed , given the ambiguity surrounding stephane , but auteuil has found the perfect balance . at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . camille is no less a complicated character , but her feelings are simpler to read . especially noteworthy is the way that camille's sudden , intense passion for stephane intertwines , and at times conflicts with her lifelong love of music . emmanuelle beart gives an astonishing , unaffected performance . emotion is often displayed in the most subtle and easy-to-miss gestures , expressions , and vocal inflections . not only are her hand movements accomplished , but the look of rapture on her face as she loses herself in the music of ravel is a clear example of how fully ms . beart allowed the personae of camille to enfold her . beart explained the importance of coming to understand music as integral to defining camille :  [director] claude [sautet] told me from the beginning , 'i will only ask one thing of you ; play the violin . the day you can play the violin , you will be camille . there is nothing more i can tell you about the character . '  indeed , it is the importance of music to camille that puts every other emotion in the film , whether displayed by her or by others , into perspective . un coeur en hiver is yet another case of real-life chemistry translating well to the screen . beart and auteuil are companions away from their acting , and the spark of this intensity , even unfulfilled as it is here , is too obvious to miss . with the exceptions of much ado about nothing and sommersby , there have been no 1993 releases to equal the power of un coeur en hiver . strong characters , intelligent writing , and exquisite performances combine to draw the audience into the movie . mental and emotional participation are demanded . this is a movie with deep , churning currents . those who are attracted only to hollywood's shallow waters may find un coeur en hiver too intimidating , but anyone who enjoys a more complex cinematic experience will find as much as they could hope for in this picture .

"sleuth , a 1972  thinking person's thriller ,  is a rich , engaging motion picture with surprises lurking in the shadows behind every narrative corner . it's a perfect metaphor for all that is to come , as the two men square off in a series of increasingly- desperate games . this is the kind of movie where the payoff isn't about getting to the end , but in savoring every moment on the long , winding trip that takes us there . this is essentially a two-man stage show transformed into a movie . with the exception of a brief showing by british thespian alec cawthorne , the only actors on screen are olivier and caine . both are so good that there's not a moment when we wish for someone else to interrupt their duel . never has such seemingly limited one-on-one interaction been so arresting . olivier is universally recognized as one of the best actors ever to grace the screen ( big or small ) . whether as heathcliffe in wuthering heights , darcy in pride and prejudice , the lead in hamlet , moriarty in the seven per cent solution , or lord marchmain in  brideshead revisited ,  olivier never disappointed . sleuth is easily one of his meatiest roles -- a chance to let go and act with relish . andrew wyke is a petty snob , but olivier makes him into a figure of both great humor and great tragedy . while we never sympathize with andrew , we do something far more important -- we understand him . olivier received one of his ten career acting oscar nominations for his work in this film , and , while it would be hyperbole to call this his most impressive outing , it's certainly one of his most memorable . michael caine's career has been somewhat more checkered than olivier's . nevertheless , while one might question the man's motives for appearing in certain films , there's no doubting his talent , and it's all on display in sleuth . but , as a result of andrew's cruelty , we soon recognize there's steel beneath milo's mild-mannered exterior . the brilliance of caine's portrayal is that we accept and believe every small transformation of personality that milo undergoes . at this point , i want to insert a warning into this review : because it's virtually impossible to discuss sleuth in any detail without giving away some of the surprises , i'm cautioning readers who want a  virgin  experience to stop reading now ( and come back once you've seen the movie ) . while my intention is not to reveal everything ( the ending , for example , will go unmentioned ) , certain plot elements will be exposed . and , while sleuth can easily be enjoyed by those who know the story inside out , why spoil some of the fun if you haven't already seen it ? to milo , it sounds like the perfect plan . there's only one problem ? andrew isn't serious . milo proves that not only is he a player of andrew's caliber , but he's faster , less principled , and more shrewd . by the time the end credits roll , it's clear who has had the final laugh . the viewer sits enraptured through the entire match between these two players , watching a series of unexpected plot twists unravel on-screen . the labyrinth at the beginning is indeed an apt metaphor . it's easy enough to guess that sleuth began life on the stage ? the narrative , with its limited setting ( most of the action takes place within a few rooms in andrew's house ) and focus on dialogue and character interaction is the kind of approach one would expect from a play . but it's hard to imagine that any live version could have been as riveting without olivier and caine , who elevate sleuth from the level of a rollicking good story to a masterpiece . here , the acting is the key , and it is never found lacking . of course , i don't mean to downplay the contribution of director joseph mankiewicz or playwright/screenwriter andrew shaffer , both of whom share credit with the actors for sleuth's success . shaffer's script is delicious ? witty , intelligent , and full of the unexpected . and , while olivier certainly has all the best lines , caine has the most glorious non-dialogue moments , such as the scene in which he dresses up as a clown in preparation for breaking into andrew's house . those who enjoyed the convolutions in david fincher's the game will find that sleuth offers many of the same pleasures without the most obvious drawback ( blatant manipulation of the audience ) . this tremendously entertaining motion picture is as effective today , more than a quarter of a century after its release , as it was in 1972 . it's not the easiest movie to find on videotape ( although it has just been released in the new dvd format ) , and many of the existing copies are in poor condition , but it's more than worth the effort to seek out .  my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down .  -- david puttnam ",1,0.0,1.0,9.722741916509999e-21
"some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning , a live-action version of mr . magoo being a prime example . the cartoon figure mr . magoo , the bumbling blind man , can be quite funny , but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images . if you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls , you are right , but there is an even more astonishing selection . mayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other with mr . magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is being chased . like home alone 3 but without any class , mr . magoo can only be described as painfully bad . fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity . the movie's humor is pathetically lame , and the pacing is way off . when one is stuck in a theater for an hour and a half watching what claims to be a motion picture , one looks for some solace . mr . magoo provides only three such moments . the movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character , who exudes his usual charm . the only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus , the sweet little bulldog . angus demonstrates more genuine emotions and a wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture . finally , the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie , which have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked . rather than attempt to adapt mr . magoo to a non-cartoon movie , nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be a human version of the cartoon . he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice , and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny . my wife managed to get some sleep during the movie , but i was not so lucky . hopefully , this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not . it is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 8 , said he thought the movie was good and really funny , but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie . he said he liked home alone 3 much more . his friend maxim , age 9 , said that he thought it was good but very silly and parts did not make sense . his other friend nickolas , age 8 , said he'd give the movie * * * 1/2 , but that it was really silly .

"much as i disliked ace ventura : pet detective , it pains me to admit that jim carrey's first star vehicle was better than this hopelessly unfunny followup . pet detective , while being exceptionally silly and dumb ( that , i suppose , was the whole point ) , still had its humorous moments . the same cannot be said of when nature calls , which , although equally moronic , left me sitting stone-faced in my seat for ninety minutes while it tried vainly to coax a laugh . there's nothing worse than a film which mistakenly believes it's the comic event of the year . for no legitimate reason whatsoever , when nature calls is full of itself to the point of being offensive . in the eyes of some fans , the rubber-faced carrey can do no wrong , and they will undoubtedly lap up when nature calls , then come back for seconds . this film was made for them . for the rest of us , who can endure the comedian only in small doses or when he's carefully reigned in ( as in the mask ) , the picture is virtually unwatchable . like cough medicine , the taste gets worse the more you're forced to ingest . when nature calls opens with an uninspired take-off of cliffhanger ( a movie that was almost a self-parody in its own right ) . of course , ace solves the case , but only after an inordinate number of idiotic jokes and failed sight gags . carrey's meteoric rise started with the first ace ventura , so it was certain there would be a sequel . what's so surprising is how creatively barren steve oedekerk's movie is . when nature calls relies solely on carrey's personality and performance to sustain it , which doesn't happen . the writing is sophomoric and the humor often makes dumb and dumber look enlightened . it's hard to imagine carrey doing something worse than when nature calls , but then i previously thought he'd have a hard time lowering himself below the standards set by pet detective . all things considered , that's an appropriate place to dump this latest installment of the ace ventura saga .

"what has happened to these people since , and what is the relevance of this photograph ? although this outline is standard issue , the circumstances surrounding it are not . the book  fatherland  is a taut thriller and author robert harris's first novel . i read this engrossing tale on vacation a few years back and thought at the time that a wonderful motion picture could be made from it . although the script by ron hutchinson and stanley weiser borrows liberally from the novel , usually reliable director christopher menaul (  prime suspect 1  and feast of july ) manages to excise much of the suspense . most of the key events from the novel are there , but in the 1994 film fatherland they are laid before the viewer devoid of much of the energy and emotion present in the novel . hitler has essentially won the war with a stalemated peace even if the us never signed a treaty , and the war on the eastern front with russia drags on ad infinitum . rutger hauer , who specializes of late in over-the-top performances , is remarkably subtle this time as major xavier march . rory jennings plays dili as an automaton who shows little emotion at times when any human being would have had to be significantly affected . in delicious bit of casting against type , jean marsh shows up briefly as a creepy old german actress who blames her lack of success in america on those jews who run the studios . the book spent more time on the detective work whereas the movie devotes too much time to establishing hauer's  good  nazi credentials . and while the book kept the reader on the edge of the chair , the movie's laconic pacing and unhurried staging robs the story of its threatening immediacy . the movie makes everything too predictable , but the book had the gift of making the obvious surprising . a gripping and lucid book is thus transformed into a confusing and slow movie that is populated with a remarkably tame group of nazis with little visible anger . even the gestapo , with the exception of their sinister hats , don't seem to be a particularly bad lot . still , the fascinating underlying plot and hauer's moving performance ultimately save the picture , but just barely . it is rated pg-13 for brief nudity , some violence and a few pictures of concentration camp victims . the film would be fine for kids age 12 and up .

"starring : elodie bouchez , gael morel , stephane rideau , frederic gorny , michele moretti , jacques nolot director : andre techine producers : alain sarde and georges benayoun screenplay : andre techine , gilles taurand , olivier massart cinematography : jeanne lapoirie released by strand releasing in french with english subtitles winner of four 1994 cesar awards ( best picture , best director , best screenplay , and best female newcomer ) , wild reeds beat out such big-name , high-budget productions as queen margot . originally commissioned by french television , but first released theatrically , this story of four youths struggling with the pressures of becoming adults in 1962 france presents an honest look at all the angst and uncertainty of finding oneself . if wild reeds was just another coming-of-age story , it wouldn't be worth more than a cursory glance . however , andre techine's semi- autobiographical look back at his final year in boarding school possesses more depth and realism than many similar films . nostalgia does not tint this narrative with its warm sepia tones . essentially a character study of the four corners of a romantic quadrangle , wild reeds examines adolescence from the point-of-view of those who feel themselves to be  outsiders ,  and shows that while the political and social climate may affect a person's development , other factors--such as friendship and love--are often more dominant . not that one is likely with francois in any case , since he's in the process of recognizing and coping with his homosexuality . branded a fascist by maite , henri arrives steeped in bitterness and anger at just about everyone and everything . gradually , through patience and effort , francois breaks through henri's facade . but it is the tempestuous relationship that develops between henri and maite that leads to one of the film's defining moments . nothing spectacular happens here . the pace is quite deliberate and occasionally a little slow . director techine simply will not be hurried . little details and character interaction make this film worth viewing . these are the kinds of people you get to understand and care about over the course of one-hundred ten minutes . emotions often seem richer and more intense in character-based dramas , and that's the case in wild reeds . there's a sense of immediacy about every new sensation and feeling . credit for this should be divided equally among script , direction , and performances--all four of which are turned in by relative newcomers . elodie bouchez , winner of the best female newcomer cesar , deserves special mention for bringing an extra measure of life to maite . ultimately , wild reeds works because it remains steadfastly true to itself . this may sound trite , but consider how many movies go for facile resolutions to satisfy the so-called  masses .  all the relationships in this film , no matter how deeply-felt , are ephemeral , and presented as such . this is a slice of life with an imperfect beginning and conclusion , but what transpires between those two endpoints is strong enough to leave an impression on anyone with the patience to commit to a movie of such unhurried temperament .

"out of respect for the stunning visuals and family entertainment value of disney's 34th animated feature , i can do no less than recommend the hunchback of notre dame . sadly , however , this is the least- enjoyable animated feature to come from the studio since its 1989 rebirth . the hunchback of notre dame is a notch below last year's pocahontas , which , in turn , was a drop from the previous year's the lion king . still , all things considered , the hunchback of notre dame isn't bad , it's just a little disappointing . despite the over-hyped and overexaggerated  darkness  of the production , kids will love it , so a box office success is assured . and those who carefully review the family entertainment competition this summer will rightfully conclude that hunchback is the surest bet . it's curious that the movie to use the most adult source material has yielded the least potent results . obviously , victor hugo's vision of the hunchback of notre dame couldn't be made into a disney cartoon -- it violates almost every aspect of the studio's traditional , feel- good/happy ending formula . so , predictably , the screenwriters diluted it , but , in doing so , they siphoned off the elements that give the story its unique power . with the darkest and most unpleasant aspects of hugo's tragedy eradicated , there's not much left . the poorly-focused remains are likely to appeal most strongly to the under-12 crowd . unlike past efforts , there aren't many in-jokes and double-entendres to catch the attention of the adults in the audience . the film loosely follows hugo's narrative . in hugo's book , the interaction between these characters fuels a complex and multi- layered drama . for , although we come to feel for  quasi  , neither esmeralda nor phoebus makes a dent in our sympathy . he's not monstrous or ugly ; he's just different . children who consider themselves oddballs or outcasts will likely identify with the hunchback . and the life-lesson about tolerance and respect for others will be understood by nearly everyone who watches the film . according to disney , frollo is the most conflicted and complex villain to have ever been brought to the animated screen . i suppose that's true on one level -- after all , he's tormented by his own lustful impulses , and acts out of religious zeal rather than plain nastiness -- but i doubt many viewers will notice . ultimately , frollo comes across as a bigoted , intolerant , but not overly-frightening , bad guy . the most impressive thing about him is tony jay's deep , resonant voice . from a musical standpoint , the hunchback of notre dame is lifeless . the songs , co-written by composer alan menken and lyricist stephen schwartz , lack energy . there are no show-stopping , toe-tapping numbers . in fact , there's nothing remotely memorable about any aspect of hunchback's soundtrack -- it's easily the poorest effort to come from menken since he started churning out scores for disney ( he's done all of the new wave animated features except the lion king ) . on the other hand , the animation is crisper and more impressive than anything since beauty and the beast , and certain computer-aided sequences are even more eye-popping than beauty's sterling ballroom scene . the festival of fools , where quasimodo first ventures out of the bell tower , is a riot of color and movement , with intricately-animated backgrounds that are more interesting than the foregrounds . if you believe that the primary purpose for animated films is to enthrall children , the hunchback of notre dame is an unquestionable success . if you're looking for entertainment for the whole family , this movie will fit the bill . but if you're anticipating something that's as diverting for adults as for younger viewers , hunchback may disappoint . since the release of the little mermaid , disney has set a high standard for its animated work , and , for the first time , one of the studio's releases struggles to distinguish itself .

"danish director lars von trier's highly acclaimed film breaking the waves explored its protagonist's conflict between her love and her god . norwegian director berit nesheim's the other side of sunday covers similar ground , but rather than a newlywed , its heroine is a young teenage girl facing the horrors of puberty . breaking the waves is close to the top of just about every critic's best of the year list for 1996 , and , although trier's picture is the better of the two films , i was similarly moved by both . american movies are obsessed with violent subject matter , and yet , luckily , violence rarely affects most of us personally . given all the life threatening situations movie characters encounter , you would expect to see them resort to prayer fairly often , but you do not . this film ignores violence and focuses its attention on faith and love . like the rebellious heroine in welcome to the dollhouse , maria is a young teen . if she had a single wish , it would probably be bigger breasts . arne borsheim's handsome cinematography is quietly in evidence , especially in the outdoor scenes . the music by bent aaserud and geir bohren for this gentle film is suitably lovely and moving , and many of the pieces have religious overtones . maria even gets into theological arguments with her father on jesus's need to go to the bathroom -- just like everyone else . let us pray and laugh .  much of the film deals with maria's exploration of her budding sexuality . this is a rich film and has all of the truth of life . it is so easy to empathize with maria's frustrations and temptations . this deeply wounds her self-esteem .  i believe in god ,  she almost weeps .  i really do . but i want to be pretty too .  a powerful film with simple , heartfelt performances by all . the script by lasse glomm , berit nesheim , and reidun nortvedt is full of lines that are naturally provocative and yet ring totally true . a gem that , sadly , few will probably ever discover . i saw it at the press screening for san jose's cinequest film festival . i hope an american distributor picks it up . it deserves the wider audience than it will ever get . this sort of cinema does not . it is in norwegian with easy to follow english subtitles . it is not rated , but would get an r . there are nudity , sexual situations , and a few profanities . the film would be fine for teenagers . i recommend this picture to you highly and give it * * * . i came close to rating it higher . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : january 16 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"sexual taboos come in all shapes and forms -- bestiality , pedophilia , incest -- but none creates a more vivid image than that of necrophilia . so , when i say that kissed is the character study of a necrophiliac , recognize that this film is intended for a very select audience . anyone who feels incapable of watching a movie that deals frankly with this subject ( even though it is , relatively speaking , tastefully approached ) should steer clear of kissed . director lynne stopkewich's feature is for adventurous movie-goers only . of course , this isn't the first motion picture to broach this  forbidden  subject , but it approaches the material in a far more serious and compassionate fashion than anything i can remember . and , as fundamentally unappealing as the concept of having sex with a corpse may be , kissed manages the considerably difficult task of humanizing a character involved in this practice . as a result , kissed isn't nearly as difficult or disturbing a film as one might suppose from a plot description . the central figure in this movie is sandra larson ( molly parker ) , a young woman who , by her own admission , has  always been fascinated by death -- the smell of it , the feel of it , and the stillness of it .  sandra isn't like other girls , though . she takes classes in embalming , even though she believes that cadavers can still feel what's being done to them . playing a role in a movie of this nature is a risky proposition for an actor , so , for that reason alone , one has to admire the courage of both molly parker and peter outerbridge . it helps , of course , that both present entirely believable performances and that they develop an effective rapport . parker , who bears a passing resemblance to american actress moira kelly , gives a slightly deeper reading than her co-star . the hallmark of kissed is its daring . at its heart , however , this movie isn't really trying to shock or revolt its audiences . it's telling a tender love story that just happens to include some exceptionally unconventional and controversial elements . what stopkewich does best here is to consistently avoid making the necrophilia gratuitous or exploitative . where he doesn't fully succeed is in conveying the spiritual rapture of sandra's secret experiences -- the use of white light , for example , comes across as corny and unconvincing . sandra may have been transported to another plane , but the director didn't get me to share the trip . a great deal more could be written about this film , since , even at only eighty minutes in length , it never fails to challenge viewers . for those who have trouble getting into , or dealing with , the primary subject matter , there are some interesting side issues . i certainly learned a great deal about what goes on behind the scenes at a funeral parlor . nevertheless , for anyone capable of keeping an open mind , kissed offers an unflinching perspective of a sweet , troubled love affair and the two warped individuals trapped in it .

"spring forward , a talkfest between two parks and recreation workers , has so much in common with my dinner with andre that it might better have been called my job with murph . the performances are all fine and heartfelt , but the story itself never provides much reason for us to care . nothing in the story , however , has much emotional impact . generally the two guys just work , never very hard , while gabbing about whatever comes to mind . he lectures murph , who laughs off most of paul's pop philosophies . murph muses that paul's recent hangover would seem rather incongruous with these beliefs . set in the small town of stacey , connecticut -- formed way back in 1708 the guys' ever-present uniforms remind us -- the pastoral setting is full of wide , green lawns and tall , stately trees . the lushness of the scenery almost makes up for the lack of a properly developed script . after trying several endings on us , the movie's penultimate one introduces a brand new character in an almost dramatic incident , which is little more than a shameless plot device .  everything goes by so much faster in the movies ,  paul tells murph in a relative non sequitur . maybe in most movies . certainly not in this one . it is rated r for language and some drug content and would be acceptable for most teenagers .

"screenplay : erick zonca and roger bohbot . director : erick zonca . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 112 minutes . many films have traced the arc of a romantic relationship in which the two principals , despite initial appearances that they are a perfect pair , are destined never to be happy together . the dreamlife of angels is the first film i can recall which traces the arc of a platonic friendship in the same terms . sparked by two superb performances in complex roles , it's as affecting and involving as any tale in which the doomed couple are romantic partners instead of pals . the dynamic between the two central characters works from the outset only because they are so carefully , beautifully drawn by erick zonca and roger bohbot . their playful irreverence makes for some entertaining scenes , and allows the two lead actresses to develop a believable chemistry . that kind of chemistry is critical to a story about a relationship -- if isa and marie don't seem like ideal best friends when they first get acquainted , the rest of the dreamlife of angels becomes utterly irrelevant . it's just as important that the appearance of an ideal pairing proves deceiving , and the film works just as well revealing that truth . the character study of the dreamlife of angels is so strong that it's easier to overlook its short-comings : a drawn-out prologue before the two women meet , under-developed supporting characters , and a third act which takes an unnecessarily melodramatic turn . zonca's minimalist direction never gets in the way of the performances , but it also does little to complement them . in fact , the story might have worked even better as a two-character stage play . that's not to take anything away from the effectiveness of those characters in the film , or the skilled actresses who bring them to life . it's a thoroughly compelling exploration of female bonding and un-bonding , a  chick flick  turned on its head . the disintegration of a friendship has rarely felt quite so tragic . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject  subscribe  .

"i found the trailers for the movie pretty lame so i was not looking forward to seeing the film . although most of the jokes fall flat , first kid is not without its charms . in fact , as the movie developed i begin to like parts of it , most especially the acting by sinbad as the first kid's secret service agent known formally as agent sam simms and informally as agent double o simms . the quality of the script is quite low , but sinbad played the character with great panache as if he had just been given the best role of the year . it is so refreshing to see actors try so hard . moreau for example , actors just brood and seem angry that the director expects them to do more than just show up on the set . in an absolutely predictable show , simms warns luke when he is surfing the net that ,  just be careful out there in cyberspace . don't tell them anything .  this of course , serves to scare overly cautious parents that the net is the enemy . personally , i'd worry more in the parking lot when i leave the theater . i have some problems with the appropriateness of parts of script . one of the early jokes , albeit one aimed at the adults , has simms telling the bartender ,  i'll have a harvey wall-banger .  actually , the joke is nothing more than a plot device so the writer can telegraph the ending . brock pierce starts off giving nothing to the role of first kid , and even by the end , he warms up maybe to mediocrity . sure . again , back to my concern about some of the messages of the show . nevertheless , there are some funny scenes at the gym and elsewhere . an impressive screen presence for such a minor part . finally , i feel a warning is necessary about the ending . given how innocuous most of the film is , i was kind of shocked by the ending . we have a child kidnapping scene complete with real guns , a very scared child , slightly bloody violence , a realistic shoot-out , and a man apparently and realistically shot dead . if your kids worry about being abducted , this could push them over the edge . now , jeffrey was not scared , but i bet many kids , especially younger ones , are and some could be very frightened . first kid runs too long at 1 : 41 . editing out of the slow parts by editor harry keramidas would have helped a lot . the film is rated pg . the language is pretty mild , and there is no sex or nudity , but note the previous warnings about the violence . jeffrey gives it three thumbs up . although i laughed some , there is not enough there for me to be able to recommend it . no matter how much energy sinbad threw into his role , director david m . evans could not get much out of the other actors so i can only give it * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"running time : 150 minutes . potential viewers who may be scared away from boogie nights by its subject matter , take note : you're not likely to find a more potent morality tale anywhere this year . the milieu may be the pornography industry of the late 1970s and early 1980s , but those with prurient interest need not apply . boogie nights is that rare example of riveting film-making which also instructs , so unobtrusively you almost can't tell you're being instructed . never has the self-delusional narcissism of the  me decade  been portrayed with such an eye to the repercussions . boogie nights does a spectacular job of re-creating its era , with its pee-chee folders , 8-track tapes and fresca , but its greater triumph is making the tunnel vision of its characters both hilarious and pathetic . when jack's sincere pronouncement that he longs to make story-centered sex films clashes with our glimpses of the mechanical , blank-faced films he is creating , it's enough to make you laugh out loud ; when dirk proudly shows off his  imported italian nylon  print shirts , it's like watching a smug dinosaur blissfully unaware of his own impending extinction . the characters in boogie nights have no sense that everything they do and everything they enjoy will soon be considered utterly ridiculous -- or worse , that they will cast a shadow over the rest of their lives . that is exactly what happens as boogie nights blasts into the 80s with a literal bang . the pace flags somewhat in the second half hour , but in a way it had to -- after the coke-fuelled pool parties , all that remains to show us is the inevitable , painful hangover . appropriately , there isn't much about the final 45 minutes of boogie nights which could be considered  fun .  cautionary story-telling rarely gets this grim , electrifying and compelling . the most talked-about moment in boogie nights will probably be the final shot , in which wahlberg finally displays the equipment ( prosthetically-enhanced , if you must know ) which has been the subject of so much discussion through the rest of the film . it would be easy to consider that moment gratuitious , but it would be just as inappropriate as thinking of boogie nights just as a movie about the porno business . in effect , the whole film is about the ultimate  dick thing ,  a group of people who simply can't see the world beyond what's going on between their legs . dirk's pep talk to his own genitalia undercuts the seemingly idyllic conclusion which precedes it -- it turns out he hasn't really learned much of anything . viewers , on the other hand , have a chance to learn more than they might expect from boogie nights . . . for instance , that sometimes a sex film isn't just a sex film . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line  subscribe  .

"the film takes a lot of liberties with the original premise and characters , weaving a story that barely resembles the one which entertained tv audiences more than twenty years ago . oddly , even though the fugitive is an admitted chase movie , the scenes before the hunt begins are among the best of the movie . we don't see much of the relationship between richard and helen kimble , but what we're presented with gives us insight into the double tragedy faced by the doctor . well-photographed and directed with a flair , this part of the movie keeps viewers on the edges of their seats . most importantly , when on the run , kimble acts like an intelligent human being . equally as refreshing , the lawmen are his match , not a bunch of uniformed dunces being run around in circles . in fact , it could be argued that both kimble and gerard are too intelligent , not to mention too lucky . the plot is far from airtight , and there are a number of contrivances that come into play to bring about the resolution . how much of these you accept depends on how much license you're willing to give the film makers . considering the overall quality of the movie , i think they deserve some room to maneuver , and most of the plot hiccups didn't bother me . the movie's pace flags somewhat during the second hour as the pursuit cools down and kimble's own search for the one armed man takes up screen time . there's a little more talking and less action during the middle portion of the movie . of course , the action predictably starts to build again as the closing moments arrive . the ending lacks originality but is nevertheless more satisfying than not . there are too many leaps of intuition and handily placed clues . simplifying this part of the story might have resulted in a more tightly constructed plot , and a little less confusion about the motivation of some of the characters . personally , i wasn't that interested in kimble's search . these moments are at the heart of the movie ; they make the picture work because it's through them that suspense is developed . a little more of this kimble/gerard interplay might have put the fugitive squarely on the same level as another of the summer's big thrillers , in the line of fire . with all apologies to harrison ford , who turns in a far more emotive and less wooden performance than in patriot games , the real acting standout is tommy lee jones . he invests his character with charisma and energy and , as gerard's grudging respect for kimble grows , so does our appreciation of what jones is doing with his seemingly straightforward role . assuming that kimble is the good guy ( which the script goes out of its way to make clear ) , that means that gerard , who's chasing him , is the bad guy . while no one could accuse the fugitive of having a masterful insight into human nature , that's not why this film was produced . there's an odd moment or two when an element of someone's behavior strikes a responsive chord , but basically the characters are developed only enough to keep us interested in them as the chase proceeds . fans of the old tv series will find echoes of the show here , but most of this version is new .  innovative  is not a legitimate description of the fugitive , but  entertaining  is .

"too many movies these days aren't smart enough to realize they would have been infinitely better recast as parodies - firestorm and hard rain come immediately to mind . arguably the best thing that can be said about the big hit is that it is smart enough to realize how dumb it is and to make the most of it . never taking itself seriously , even for a moment , the movie features silly dialog (  ladies , you're so fine i want to pour milk over you and make you a part of my complete breakfast .  ) and shoot 'em up action played for maximum camp . cisco and the other members of his crew like to show off their buff bodies , and the picture includes some conspicuous rear male nudity to titillate the audience . taavo soodor's set decoration is a hoot . but this funny subplot is basically unprintable . among the movie's more absurd scenes is a car chase and demolition derby , during which cisco uses his car like paul bunyan to fell the big trees in his path . the movie even uses instant replays to show you exactly how the characters manage to escape certain death . well , lots of bad things do happen in the hit men . and its director kirk wong has the audience laughing at most of them . it is rated r for violence , profanity and brief nudity and would be fine for teenagers .

"equal parts fantasy , satire , and pathos , ma vie en rose investigates the role of sexual stereotypes in today's culture , and shows how the more conservative elements of society encourage conformity and stifle diversity . in terms of both its style and story , this is one of 1997's few unique motion pictures ; it's understandable why it has captured a landslide of film festival awards . it's regarded as  just part of growing up .  the result -- a boy who adopts the traits of a girl -- is unacceptable . such a child , who plays with dolls , puts on makeup , and wears dresses , is likely to become a pariah . and that is the situation explored by alain berliner's debut feature , ma vie en rose . ludovic can't understand what the fuss is about . so why shouldn't he wear makeup and dresses , and play with dolls ? those who assume that he's gay have missed the point entirely -- sexuality isn't even an issue , at least not at this young age . one of berliner's successes is his ability to effectively realize multiple viewpoints . while ma vie en rose gets into ludovic's head and convincingly presents his confusion regarding the adults' negative reactions to his behavior , it also conveys the sense of near-panic that grips his parents . another standout aspect of the movie is its strong , vivid use of colors . nearly every hue of the spectrum is represented in pastels and fluorescents . in the end , it's apparent that the intense colors of ludovic's neighborhood do little to lighten the darkness that lurks in the hearts of many of the residents . to further emphasize their lack of human compassion , berliner paints many of ludovic's neighbors as caricatures , and occasionally has some fun at their expense . although the most memorable element of ma vie en rose is the forceful visual style , the director proves himself to be an apt student of human nature . the film works because we understand the central characters and their tribulations . when ludovic is teased and tormented , it's easy to remember how much unthinking cruelty there is in this world , whether the setting is paris or next door . but , when all is said and done , ma vie en rose is more of a fantasy than a straight drama , and berliner's lighthearted touch keeps the film buoyant when it could easily turn grim . - ingmar bergman ",2,0.00361035513569,0.00186139159694,0.994528253267
"even with a minimal amount of conversations taking place , the characters were seen dancing and horsing around , as their personalities were allowed to shine forth in a natural manner . in reality , this never occurred in vietnam ; but , it is used by cimino as a necessary metaphor to show how insane the war is . this one-shot theory when it is used for deer hunting , can be seen as something sensible , as if it reflects true sportsmanship . this film offers a very puzzling and complex moral take on the war and on those who were directly affected by it , as cimino makes no apology for the volunteer soldiers fighting a bad war , he only revels in how poignant michael's odyssey is-for he is the hero of this story and the most compelling one in it-but even he can't feel at home after his adventure , his war experiences were too mind-boggling for him to even talk about what is bothering him . what makes this film exceptional , one of the best films of the '70s , is not the story , which is good but not great , and not the cinematography , which is pleasing in scope but doesn't break new ground in its camera work . it is the performers themselves who take the story to spell-binding heights and make this a great film , making you care enormously about the characters they play . de niro gives a riveting performance as he searches for meaning to his life , making his patriotism seem genuine and his participation in a war that made no sense to a lot of people , something that needs no apology , just like his deer kill is done like a true sportsman would do it ; that is , if you must kill a deer , at least , do it the right way . streep's performance is more subtle , as her facial expressions give way to the great psychological strain she is under , not sure of what is happening to her , but realizing that there is a tremendous void in her life . john savage is convincing as a good guy who got a few bad breaks in life and couldn't fully recover from it . walken won an oscar as a supporting actor , in a film that won a total of five oscars , including those for best picture , editing , sound , and director . the remainder of the cast added to the haunting feeling that this was a tale of significant moral and political weight . cazale's performance as a weasel , staying out of the war , hiding behind a phony macho persona , is a fitting one , in contrast to the guys who enlisted . it is an astonishing film . a one of a kind experience . the stupidity of the war and all its atrocities , as it is stunningly presented by the filmmaker , leaves one without a chance to escape the moral implications of the war or does it give one a chance to recapture a lost innocence . the filmmaker seems to be saying , you can run away from vietnam and try to avoid it , but you can't get completely away from it , its devastation touched every part of america , and this film , whose viewpoint is not taken from the liberal side of the political spectrum , as anti-war films usually are , but wants to respect the opinions of conservative working -class america , the one's who sent their sons to fight this war . and what the film offers as a poignant reminder about war , even as it is a testament to the soldiers of the war , is how the war harmed even those who coolly survived it , and how it left the american psyche scarred for life .

"producers : brooke breton and bonne radford . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , adult themes ) running time : 85 minutes . in the last decade or so , animated feature film-making has not just risen from the dead , it has become the most consistently reliable hollywood genre for creative entertainment . compare the unqualified artistic successes ( beauty and the beast , toy story , toy story 2 , a bug's life , the iron giant ) and solid entertainments ( antz , aladdin , the prince of egypt ) with the out-and-out duds ( quest for camelot , the king and i . . . pretty much everything from warner bros . _except_ the iron giant , actually ) , and you'll find a batting average any studio would kill for . the  disney model  has led to films from several studios in which strong scripts and genuine creative energy generate -- pardon the cliche -- fun for the whole family . it's easy to visualize a live-action version of the road to el dorado as a colossal failure , clumsily mixing whimsy with huge production values . the animated version , however , manages a multitude of charms . in any number of ways , the road to el dorado does feel like a too-obvious attempt to mimic disney's 1990s animated output . like the lion king , the film combines a hans zimmer score with songs by elton john and lyricist tim rice , among them the catchy ( if not instantly hummable )  the trail we blaze  and  it's tough to be a god .  there's even a disney voice veteran in kevin kline , who previously worked on the hunchback of notre dame . the basic story progression is familiar , and the obligatory musical numbers are feeling a bit more obligatory all the time . it's pretty fair to say that the road to el dorado doesn't do anything radically different than the dozen or so disney animated features that have preceded it . then again , why mess with success ? the makers of the road to el dorado seem to understand that telling a good story with wit and excitement will be enough to satisfy virtually anyone . they begin with a pair of roguishly likeable protagonists -- well-performed by kline and branagh and splendidly animated -- who carry the story effectively . directors bibo bergeron and will finn lead them through a series of wild , high-spirited action sequences , unobtrusively combining computer-generated details and traditional cel animation . and the script and the character animation provide more hearty laughs than a dozen recent live-action comedies . sure , there's a formula to the road to el dorado , but it rarely seems like those involved are content to let their film feel formulaic . within the constraints of their genre , everyone is working to keep the film lively and appealing . the road to el dorado certainly isn't the most inspired animated film to come down the pike . the character development is a bit sketchy , the villainous tzekel-kan doesn't get enough time to show his villainy and even a toned-down rosie perez is still rosie perez . it's not a dazzling visual spectacle , and it's not going to move anyone to tears . it is , however , the kind of sturdy , generally smart film craftsmanship that shows up far more often when a world is drawn than when it's photographed . maybe it's the unique creative perspective of animators ; maybe it's the freedom inherent in creating a world from scratch . or maybe it's just one of those golden ages we here so much about but experience so rarely . the road to el dorado may not be solid gold , but it continues an impressive string of animated features worth spending your silver on . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject  subscribe  .

"the payoff in the film comes in a slick surprise ending , as now has become the custom of the director and is what the audience expects . night has honed his skills from his previous films by showing an improvement in technique and filmmaking style , while continuing his penchant for making films with box-office pop . though there is a certain disdainful emptiness in this film , as there was in his others , but this film sustains itself with the keen performances by the understated one bruce willis gives and the punctiliously perverse one samuel l . jackson gives , as the film is able to amble along at its leisurely pace , building on character development and the unique relationship the two stars develop , until the mystery story takes hold in the last twenty minutes and puts the exclamation point on the far-fetched tale it was weaving . this subdued action film is unlike other action-hero films , as the action is not the thing here . what counts the most , is what secret the film is covering up and why . it is especially delightful for those who like puzzlers and think they can gather enough clues to take a stab at guessing the outcome . even though night has matured as a director , this surprise ending is not as engaging as the one he came up with in the blockbuster the sixth sense , which caught audiences completely off-guard . but this film is a more mature work and has fuller characterizations . so the former has arguably a better ending , but this one is a better realized overall film . the basic plot is simple . as his face changes expressions , we can sense something tragic is about to happen . elijah believes that david may be the 'unbreakable' person he is looking for , someone to give hope for this mediocre age we live in , as he believes the super-hero myth is as true as if it was history -- which is asking a lot for an adult audience to swallow , but . . . that's hollywood ! and if he has a weakness , it might be water , as even superman had a weakness from kryptonite . his reasoning supposes --  if there is someone like me in the world , shouldn't there be someone at the other end of the spectrum ?  the major stumbling block , to this otherwise involving film , is the let down in the third act . the action in it seemed obligatory and not really germane to the story , as an anonymous psycho serial killer is introduced to prove that david has the super-powers of the comic book hero . this encounter , of him stopping the violent psychopath killer never worked right , as it seemed flat and arbitrary , spoiling but not ruining the overall achievement of the film . what this unconventional mainstream film did right for itself , was to provide a modern type of super-hero for an audience that thrives on escapist films that can fill them with some hope that there's a savior out there in the fight between good and evil ( something hollywood films could always be counted on to provide the public with ) . it is a film that is confident enough of its ability to tell its story that it doesn't have to rely on special effects . and , perhaps , as an homage to hitchcock or maybe it's a case of egomania , night once again appears in his own film .

"in my humble opinion , documentaries are the highest of the cinematic art form . the best documentaries can let us see worlds we have never seen before or give us fresh insights into places with which we naively think we already are familiar . from the famous documentaries like triumph of the will and hoop dreams to the spectrum of lessor known but nevertheless fascinating ones like anne frank remembered , frosh : nine months in a freshman dorm and theremin : an electronic odyssey , we learn more from them than most fictional movies . to this great tradition is added director robert epstein and jeffrey friedman's the celluloid closet which looks at the depiction of gays and lesbians in the movies from the silent films to the today's pictures . although the film will clearly appeal to homosexuals and to film buffs , i believe that anyone seeing this documentary will find it an absolutely engrossing and fascinating movie . i believe that after seeing the celluloid closet , i now have a fresh perspective on the cinema and will never see films in quite the same way again . this movie helps you in reading the subtext of the movies better than any i have ever seen . as the movie starts , narrator lily tomlin tells us that ,  hollywood , that great maker of myths , taught straight people what to think about gays and gay people what to think about themselves .  the format of the movie , beautifully edited by jeffrey friedman and arnold glassman , is to intersperse interviews with mainly gay people in the film industry with substantial length clips of movies to illustrate their points . actor and writer harvey fierstein said ,  the hunger i felt as a kid looking for gay images was not to be alone .  although the documentary skips around a little bit , it mainly sticks to a chronological line . during this period , there were films with more honest and open depiction of homosexuality particularly those of marlene dietrich . with the advent of the legend of decency formed by the catholic church in 1934 , the movie industry agreed to a strict code where many activities were absolutely forbidden , and the censor had control over even the small parts of the script otherwise it would not get the seal of approval and without it no theater owner would dare show the film nor any studio dare make it . after this time , gay characters continued to be in films , but they were much subtler . also , during the 30s , gays were almost always shown as villains . the documentary shows clip after clip of movies with characters that were clearly gay like peter loire in the maltese falcon , but whom were not acknowledged as being so . they said the censors were not  rocket scientist  and so writers got a lot of pictures past them with gay characters , and the censors were never the wiser . some of the clips you could disagree with , but clearly most of the characters they claim to be gay or lesbian are . they showed the homosexual relationships in ben-hur and said that the writer never told charlton heston about it , or he would have come unglued . you're not bad looking . . . you've never had a man . that's your problem .  one of best interviewees is screenwriter susie bright . in the 80s films like making love began to show homosexuality in new open , honest , and explicit ways . by the 90s , the climate became much more open , nevertheless , as tom hanks says ,  there is a constant desire on the part of the studios to make characters likable .  the movie ends with k . the celluloid closet runs a beautifully paced 1 : 42 . it is rated r for some nudity and sex scenes . personally , i think it would be fine for any teenager that is interested enough to see the picture . i think the film is great and recommend it strongly . i firmly believe i will be a better viewer and critic after being fortunate enough to have seen this documentary . the celluloid closet easily gets * * * 1/2 in my book . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"screenplay : barry schneider & richard hawley . director : yves simoneau . hey , mr . development executive , have i got a pitch for you . now here's the casting twist : jamie lee curtis , scream queen ingenue of late 70s/early 80s horror films as the * villain * . give it a french director and some moody photography to make it look more respectable , and voila ! you've got a bona fide hit on your hands , right ? well , probably not . mother's boys occupies that unfortunate middle ground between teen scarefest and pop phenom psychothriller , inevitably limiting its audience . it also swings wildly from the subtly creepy to the just-plain-dumb . robert will have none of it , but jude is more than determined--she's sociopathic . mother's boys is one of those movies where it's easy to spend a lot of time picking apart flaws in logic , if logic is something you expect from your thrillers . i suppose it would have been too stereotypical for callie to be * just * a teacher . then there are silly details like the band-aid which is supposed to cover the cut on jude's forehead , and  cliche alert  problems like the use of not one , not two , but * three * nightmare sequences . the script is sloppy in its attempt to explain jude's pathology , and the character development is virtually non-existent . yet for all that , mother's boys still almost won me over on style points alone . from the eye-catching opening credits to the climax , director yves simoneau gives the production a smoky , dreamlike atmosphere which maintains tension throughout . the story is thankfully short on gothic excess , and i was pleasantly surprised by the twist to jude's plan . jamie lee curtis is generally well- directed , veering into the overblown only rarely . finally , it leaves kes at a point of uncertainty , a rarity in films of any kind . while it may not have done much for my brain , mother's boys did get my skin crawling . what disappointed me about mother's boys was that i thought it made the wrong choices about jude . once the choice was made to go in the latter direction , mother's boys committed itself to being a thriller , and ultimately it's not that scary . how much more interesting it would have been to watch jude turn all three boys against callie , be more subtle in her seduction of robert , or make callie want to leave .

"keeping the faith is not a feature length version of the old joke about a priest and a rabbi walking into a bar . . . not exactly , anyway . the set-up finds director/co-star edward norton exploiting exactly that concept as his character -- new york catholic priest brian finn -- relates the film's story to an incredulous barkeep . there's a lot of ground to be covered in a romantic comedy that also introduces questions of faith , cultural and religious melting pots and balancing career and personal goals . and keeping the faith seems intent on covering every last square foot of it . screenwriter stuart blumberg dashes madly back and forth between themes , while norton dashes madly back and forth between tones ( how else to describe a sentimental romance that also includes slapstick dips in holy water fonts and the surreal inclusion of  heroes of the torah  trading cards ? ) . oh , and somewhere along the way they're supposed to fit in a love story . it's no wonder norton felt the need to have a lightweight film clock in at two hours plus . thank heaven that keeping the faith is often quite funny in its fragmented , scattershot way . blumberg's script is ripe with good dialogue , and a couple of solidly crafted set pieces ( including a jewish american princess date from hell ) . stiller continues to build a body of comic screen work that measures up to any of his contemporaries , giving zing to jake's self-deprecating manner . there are eye-catching bit parts , including ken leung in a very funny scene as a karaoke machine salesman . and there's jenna elfman , who has never particularly impressed me in the past except as a ball of energy . here she's a completely convincing object of desire ( even if norton lingers on her close-ups a bit too lovingly ) , luminous , intelligent and driven . as one part of a romantic pairing , she's a tough act to match . the match , as it turns out , becomes one of keeping the faith's bigger problems . the premise is sound enough , but stiller never looks comfortable as a romantic lead . in fact , there's more plausible chemistry between elfman and norton , and not just because both actors are blonde -- the pairing we're expected to root for just doesn't seem like a particularly good combination of personalities . how much more interesting -- and daring -- keeping the faith might have been if the film had suggested anna was merely sublimating her desire for brian with jake , making for much tougher choices at the film's conclusion . that's probably too much to ask from a film that , at its core , is a fairly fluffy hollywood confection . it's certainly a pleasant enough diversion , good for more than enough chuckles to make it worth a look , but it's surprisingly timid for a film that tries to cover so many thematic elements . it's also a lot warmer 'n' fuzzier than you'd expect from the cinematic equivalent of  a priest and a rabbi walk into a bar . . .  see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject  subscribe  .

"it is one of the more cumbersome pieces of baggage which goes along with being a film critic that , every once in a while , a film comes along which you are _supposed_ to like on general principle . critics are sometimes placed in the uncomfortable position of being expected to champion small , ennobling films simply because , like cinematic castor oil , they are good for us . we were colored is a film which wears its earnestness proudly on its sleeve ; it means well , and it tries hard . but a film has to have something more going for it than principle , and once upon a time . . . is a well-acted but extremely fragmented story which can't quite get its tone down straight . we were colored is not particularly interested in detailing the day-to-day ugliness of life in the segregated south ; it is a film about a kind of community which no longer exists , and as such it is occasionally quite touching . it is difficult not to watch scenes of 4th of july barbecues for which the whole town turns out , or to notice how the people of glen allan look out for each other , without feeling a sense of sadness that that unity had to disappear with the passing years . the main problem with once upon a time is that it makes frequent side trips to episodic stories which don't resonate , despite insistent voice-over narration ( provided by screenwriter paul w . cooper ) that tries to convince us that they should . the story allows for a scene in a backwater juke joint which adds a bit of atmosphere , but the relationship doesn't really matter , because there's a history there we haven't had a chance to see . there is an incompleteness to many of the individual episodes , and a lack of emotion to scenes which seem designed to provoke an emotional response . too often , however , the film drifts away from cliff's point-of-view , or injects an obligatory bit of racial violence almost because it seems to be expected . first-time feature director tim reid maintains a steady pace and evokes the atmosphere of his setting skillfully , but he doesn't find a narrative in the many stories he is trying to put on the screen . if its story and its characters had been as consistent as its good intentions , it might have been a great film .

"something happens when innovative , independent directors  go hollywood ,  and it's not usually a good something . some directors are ready-made for the pressures and compromises involved in working with big stars and big budgets ; others are so clearly out of their element that you can see them straining against the strictures of studio projects . sam raimi , director of the goofy and off-beat evil dead films , was hand-picked by sharon stone to helm the quick and the dead , and it looks like he had some interesting ideas about how to turn it inot a cock-eyed parody of spaghetti westerns . instead , it's not played with enough of a wink , and it becomes an extremely repetitive story muddled by tone shifts and unnecessary sub-plots . a few of the early gunfights are handled with typical raimi panache , including liberal use of the trackback/zoom in camera movement utilized by hitchcock and spielberg most notably . everywhere there are glimpses of raimi's twisted sense of humor , nowhere more so than in a gunfight which ends with the loser staring down at his shadow and noticing a hole in it . but that's all we get in the quick and the dead -- glimpses . where raimi wants self-awareness , screenwriter simon moore delivers a fairly standard western revenge saga . the story has potential , and particularly when a flashback reveals the source of ellen's grief there is evidence of some compelling psychological background . the relationship between cort and herod might have been exploited better , but for the most part cort is playing a part culled entirely from eastwood's penitent gunslingers in pale rider and unforgiven . and this is the real knock on the quick and the dead : without a real focus on raimi's satirical sensibilities and acrobatic camera tricks , it's just a less-than-mediocre knock-off of eastwood's oeuvre . gene hackman is a marvelous villain , oozing despicable charm , but his presence only magnifies the comparisons to unforgiven , and when he exposes a boastful gunman ( lance henriksen ) as a fraud , it sounds exactly like his debunking of english bob's self-aggrandizing tales in that earlier film . sharon stone is surprisingly effective as the haunted vengeance-seeker , but ultimately she too is lost in a story that doesn't really seem to have a sense of purpose . the quick and the dead boasts some fine cinematography by dante spinotti and a wonderfully dilapidated production design , and they could have been used in the service of a nice piece of parody . unfortunately , raimi couldn't or wouldn't let the throttle out , and the quick and the dead stalls when it's played far too straight .

"although mary reilly is being billed as a remake of the dr . jekyll and mr . hyde story , i believe it is actually a remake of my fair lady . i can easily imagine professor higgins bolding proclaiming that he could take a famous story full of action and imagination , populate it with megastars , turn it into a colossal bore and yet so stun the audience with his audacity that no one would leave . everyone would know the story and the stars so they would wait until the last moment to realize that he had transformed a prince of a movie into a guttersnipe and that nothing of interest was ever going to happen in the film . as the audience leaves dazed and bewildered , colonel pickering must have been singing ,  you've done it , you've done it , i can't believe you've done it .  the movie starts off promisingly enough with realistic gas and candle lit photography ( philippe rousselot ) . this , however , rapidly degenerates into a movie so dark and with such low contrast that your eyes , when you can keep them awake , will literally hurt from squinting so much trying to make out the action , or usually lack thereof , on the screen . the movie is filmed in edinburgh , but it is so dark , you'd never know it . most of the time , during this and all parts of the movie , is devoted to atmospheric scenes of one cast member or another slowly walking through rooms where little happens . it is hard to believe that this movie shares the same lineage with the numerous other dr . jekyll and mr . hyde pictures . in a failed attempt to solve this problem he comes up with lots of gratuitous violence and major amounts of human and animal blood . actually , my distaste for the movie comes not from disliking these scenes , but from being put to sleep by the boredom of the show . for some reason dr . jekyll looks a lot like ethan hawke in before sunrise . sure . the acting by the three great stars is an embarrassment . glenn close has no idea of what to do with her role and plays it like a stone . julia roberts seems to think that so long as she is made up to appear unattractive , and she grimaces a lot , she has achieved great art . last , and certainly least , is john malkovich's disappointing performance . i would list him close to the top of the best actors working today . in good shows and bad , i have been nothing less than in awe of his work until now . somehow , professor higgins , i mean stephen frears manages to get an uninteresting performance out of malkovich . this is a miracle i did not think possible . many scenes of no interest in the less are left in the final cut . although there is no sex , nudity , or bad language , there is so much gore that the movie is correctly rated r . although it might bore them to death , i do not think the movie would be bad for teenagers . on the other hand , i had trouble staying awake , and i wish i would have walked out so i do not recommend this extremely s-l-o-w film to anyone . rent any of the previous versions instead . i give the movie 1/2 of a * only because i've seen worse . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"i saw changing habits at its world premier and was fortunate the next day to be granted a personal interview with its talented director , lynn roth . this review includes the highlights of the interview as well as some of the comments she made at the premier . since the movie has a well known cast and crew , i predict the picture will quickly be picked up by a distributor . although they are played believably , they are each quite funny . she doesn't speak because she doesn't feel any need . she does end up saying exactly one word in the show , and that scene is precious . the story is hard to categorize . this part is a quasi-romantic comedy . the movie is both enchanting and wise . if forced to categorize it , i guess i would label it a coming-of-age story , but it is so much more . the performances are all good with one exception . i thought christopher lloyd took too long to get into character . some shows are more than the some of its parts , and this is one . i attribute this to the talent of first-time director lynn roth . technically the show is highly polished . most of this can be attributed to the choice of an accomplished cinematographer , michael mayers . you may have admired his work in spanking the monkey and denise calls up . the only major problem i had with the movie was the surprising turn the show takes toward the end . i thought it was too abrupt and out of character for the rest of the film . i discussed this with the director . she told me she wanted this part isolated because she did not want the film to be too much of a downer . i found out more about the picture and roth's career . she said that the film was made over a period of just 20 long days . the producer , whose background is in casting , wanted dylan walsh to play felix , but he said no . she said that i looked old enough to have seen it , which i was , and i did . from there she had a series of positions in writing , producing , and sometimes acting . she likes theatrical movies best because it gives you a freedom that television does not . she did say that some of the cable channels , she mentioned a couple , are beginning to encourage directors without putting the limitations on them that networks normally do . i hope the distributors form a good habit by picking up her work quickly . in a strong film festival , this was one of the best . it is not yet rated but will probably get a pg-13 for a little bad language . the show would be fine for kids say 10 and up . i recommend the show to you and give it * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : january 30 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"therefore the film chooses not to focus too much on the precocious kid's gift , going almost exclusively for his father's nightmarish visions to tell its tale . as a result , the lesson being becomes : never play mind games you don't understand with someone inexperienced and not completely reliable who has you under their power . though , at times , the story is close to losing it , getting enveloped in melodramatics , it manages to pull back and return to the family and their struggle with the existence of a ghost in their house and their marital problems , keeping the film suspenseful , allowing you to overlook if you care to , the many holes in the story . the film just lost control of what it had going for it that made it different from , let's say , another recent ghost film , the sixth sense , and plummeted it back into the world of the run-of-the mill films of that genre . it is illustriously shot and its ghostly visions are stunningly creepy . it also captures in its sights the good , bad , and ugly of chicago . this fast moving film has hooked onto the nuances of its working class neighborhood completely , and by being grounded with this kind of reality the ghost story becomes more effective . >from this character driven film , we learn that ghosts get angry when we don't respond to them properly . that the afterworld is a place that some of us more than others have a chance to penetrate and if we do , we better learn how to listen . kevin bacon plays the role convincingly , with just the right amount of skepticism and psychological tension , coming close but never going over the top , like a lesser actor might have been tempted to do . zachary david cope seems like a child who is used to seeing strange things all his life and is rather placid and accepting about it , playing his role as well as could be expected . but i did have some problems that what was happening to him was not more fully developed . i felt i didn't really know much more about him by the film's end than from its beginning . in both sequences ghosts are communicating with him . i just had the feeling that the kid could end up being a basket case if his folks didn't take some time to help him deal with his gift , and that even though they were hard working and nice people , they were not a very perceptive couple . what transpires is an ok ghost story , a suspenseful story of an ordinary couple trying to cope with something that they are not prepared for , and a weak murder story , that ruins the film , as it brings it down to earth in a most desultory manner . is the film worth seeing ? yes . it is entertaining and spooky , and you get taken on an emotional roller coaster ride . no . it is earthbound and contrived , and the ending is a stinker . take your pick , both answers are correct .

"short cuts is a dozen short stories all neatly woven together into a seamless whole . most of all , however , it is a robert altman film . let me be candid with you and confess that i have seen most of altman's works , and i generally rank them from so-bad-i-walked-out to watchable-with-some-good-parts . this movie blew me away , perhaps because i love documentaries so much ( e . g . , with the exception of the bad singer who sang terrible , cliched songs , every character was extremely interesting and different . it was a tribute to the script that you could even get to recognize much less care about this many characters in so short a time . i admit it did start a bit slow since it had a lot of people to introduce . the hospital scene with the very sick little boy was so real that i had to keep myself twice from praying for him ! the camerawork and editing was handled especially well - never choppy , yet it switched around a lot among the stories . they used the technique popularized in the movie slacker where the character in story a goes by the character in story b and the camera switches from a to b without changing momentum . also , most of the stories had a character that linked it to another . that the occupations were so varied was another reason it had a documentary feel . like most hollywood movies however they have no idea how many people smoke these days . 80% of the people smoked cigarettes in this movie whereas it is closer to 20% in the real world . also too much smoking of dope in the show as sort of a natural thing to do . one of the lines in the movie was  all they ever do in la is snort coke and shout .  short cuts runs 3 : 07 , but i would not have wanted them to cut it down at all . it is rated r for drug use , nudity , sex , etc . it would be okay for older teenagers if you go with them . i am still thinking about the show , give it * * * 1/2 , and recommend it to you highly . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : february 28 , 1994 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"if you've always been curious about exactly what heaven and hell look like , what dreams may come offers some intriguing suggestions . in director vincent ward's long cinematic sermon on the advantages of a moral life , the movie depicts heaven as a happy , colorful landscape painting and hell as an eerie , gray , holocaust graveyard overflowing with talking heads . the rarely subtle film shows two dead children from inside their coffins during the opening credits . both are deeply scarred characters who share their troubles with us in almost every scene . if the movie were involving , it could have been the downer of the year . instead , it stays at the level of visual technical achievements with the figures in it about as real as those in art gallery paintings -- lovely to look at , but nothing to get concerned over . gooding , like the rest of the fine actors , is largely wasted in a movie that works only at an ethereal level . the magical film is artistically surreal but only sporadically realistic . the script by ronald bass , based on richard matheson's novel , could have used a little more levity and should have given the characters some credible depth .  i'm in dog heaven .  this delightfully natural humor is regretfully absent in most of the movie . the story's pop messages include such trite ones as ,  good people end up in hell because they can't forgive themselves .  ( okay now , let's all forgive ourselves so we will get to pass through the pearly gates successfully . whew , that's a collective load off our shoulders . ) the film shows us a heaven that is a blend of the nineteenth-century landscape paintings of turner and cole mixed with impressionistic touches . not only is it gorgeous , the paint isn't even dry yet . these dazzling images are among the loveliest and most innovative hollywood has created in years . with michael kamen's dramatic music and yvonne blake's sumptuous costumes for the afterlife , the film works best when viewed as grand opera as illustrator maxfield parrish might have staged it . moral rules , it seems , are filled with fine print . a movie filled with absolutely stunning imagery , it is strangely cold and unengaging despite all its beauty . still , the pedantic script's tedium is more than offset by the handsomeness of the production . what dreams may come is a feast for the eyes even if not a particularly filling meal for the mind . it is rated pg-13 for thematic elements involving death , some disturbing images , profanity including the f-word and brief nudity . the film would be fine for teenagers .

"if there has been one theme one can identify running through the work of director barry levinson , it is the search for the american dream . jimmy hollywood is another such story , but it is lacking something previous levinson projects had , namely a firm grasp on what the protagonsists' dreams were . there are interesting ideas in the script , and some of the dry humor characteristic of levinson's dialogue , but it's never all that compelling because the character of jimmy alto is too schizophrenic , and with him the tone of the whole film . one is about the thankless life of being a struggling actor , including the cattle calls , waiting tables and shameless self-promotion necessary to make it . it is typical of levinson to make his heroes' motives less than completely pure , but in this instance they're simply muddled . it is difficult to care all that much about jimmy , and it's difficult to figure out whether levinson wants us to focus on his characters or the setting . it is also a simple truth that jimmy hollywood was a hard film for me to like . while it has its humorous moments , it's too grim to be a purely entertaining comedy , and it doesn't explore its dark themes deeply enough to be an insightful drama . its two principal characters are frequently more pathetic than they are sympathetic , the pacing is extremely deliberate , and the shifts in tone had me shifting in my seat a lot . when i did find interesting elements , it was more a case of detatched admiration than enjoyment . among the objects of admiration were two performances , neither of them joe pesci's . his co-stars , however , are quite good . the big surprise is a funny and affecting christian slater , whose forgetful william does the low-key performance in untamed heart one better . slater is developing into a complete actor , and his performance here is extremely interesting . yet perhaps  interesting  is the faint praise with which i ultimately damn jimmy hollywood . i found a number of things in the film interesting . i just found none of them truly engaging .

"it is hard for me to believe that one of the world's greatest directors and one of my favorites , paul cox ( lonely hearts/my first wife/man of flowers/cactus/a woman's tale ) , made a film that was so saintly that it seemed to be without dramatic affect or chinks in its pious armor . this is not a commercial film , nor one that tends to compromise its serious tone in order to become more entertaining . it is a true story that tries not to flinch from the suffering it presents and from the altruistic virtues of the dedicated priest who is only interested in comforting those shunned by society because of leprosy . it eschews the tricks of filmmaking in its presentation of such a morbid subject , to its detriment . there is no bend in this film . in this beautifully shot film on the island of kalaupapahe , catching the lushness of the hawaiian islands , cox has taken the subject matter of suffering to a new degree of intensity and requires the viewer to be either fully absorbed in it or else it would be impossible to feel anything about such a miserable topic as 19th century leprosy ( hansen's disease ) . there is medicine for treating leprosy as of 1940 , but the undeveloped countries still can't afford that medicine , so the disease is still around . and as brilliant a study as this is , taking on such a difficult subject , this brilliance fails to amount to anything more than being a history lesson about hawaii and about those banished to die alone from that disease on an abandoned hawaiian island called molokai . he is so touched by this , that the first leper he sees , who is a child , he not only touches but embraces . unfortunately , the storytelling remains flat despite the superb character performance by the australian david wenham . in one scene , the most dramatic one in the film , lepers are tossed off the boat docked on the island's harbor and many of them drown . it is a scene of immense cruelty , but seems to have happened as if it were a dream and not real , as not much is made of it and the film just continues on without giving pause to that event . the film just couldn't say more about the priest except that he made conditions better , converted many to catholicism , and contacted the disease and died , relieved to know that the nuns have come at last and that there is another priest to carry on the work . these are fine accomplishments , but i'm afraid , they are not dramatic enough to energize this film . i felt anguished about all the piety i was seeing , but the film despite all its obvious flaws lingered with me for a long time afterwards and i'm not quite sure why . that is why i liked it better when the film had a chance to sink in , than i did when first watching it . it's a tough film to enjoy and i'm not sure i learned anything about suffering from it , that is if i was supposed to , but i do think i saw someone who i believe is an actual saint , and he was a spellbinding saintly figure despite being so unapproachable . it was the very best thing i have to say about a tedious film that i am glad i saw , even if i was not entertained by it .

"what would you say ? this opportunity of a lifetime may never be yours , but it is john sullivan's ( james caviezel ) in frequency . in a lesser director's hands , this movie could easily have dissolved into schmaltz or a cheap sci-fi flick . director gregory hoblit ( fallen and primal fear ) , aided again by david rosenbloom's perfectly timed editing , delivers a thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat and a heart-warming father-son story that comes along as a wonderful bonus . the effects of modifying the past are ingeniously explored by the wonderfully complex and satisfying script of first-time writer toby emmerich . the tightly-written script contains twist upon twist , and its potential holes appear to be thoroughly plugged . the intense film works more for the writing and the directing than the acting , although the actors are more than adequate . among the examples of the script's ingenuity is the way that the shared desk is used to communicate across time . this is , however , the type of film that may disappoint some viewers . they liked the action-thriller parts -- including some impressive fires and explosions -- but somehow couldn't deal with sincere expressions of love between a father and a son . personally , i was close to tears . frequency can legitimately be called a good-spirited thriller , a category that barely exists . it is also sometimes funny with one of the best parts concerning a stock recommendation . the intriguing story holds your attention from start to finish . with characters worth caring about and a mesmerizing plot , the movie is thoroughly entertaining and intelligent to boot . and like many a movie , it isn't the saccharinely silly story that the movie's trailers might lead you to believe . this is an intense and fast-paced film that sometimes literally takes your breath away . it is rated pg-13 for intense violence and disturbing images and would not be appropriate for those under 13 .

"director : jane campion . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( brief nudity , adult themes ) running time : 145 minutes . directors , both cinematic and theatrical , face their greatest challenges when dealing with  classic  material , and not just because audience familiarity with the text makes every step a potentially treacherous one . no , the real temptation is to go too far in an attempt to make the material -- pronounce the following word dripping with sarcasm --  relevant .  never mind that the text most likely achieved its lofty status because its themes transcend the socio-political flavor of the month ; the director is determined to give it a contemporary spin . the irony of jane campion's adaptation of henry james' the portrait of a lady is that campion treats the narrative , a narrative with an intrinsic emotional force , with meticulous faithfulness , while her heavy hand as a director inspires plenty of head-shaking . campion opens the portrait of a lady with voice-overs of modern women discussing their thoughts on romantic love , followed by a credits sequence featuring black-and-white images of women ( we assume the same ones we just heard ) just hanging out together in nature . campion certainly sympathizes with female characters who seem trapped by societal proscriptions ( like the heroines of an angel at my table and the piano ) , but nearly every interpretation of isabel feels misguided and simplistic . the central question of why isabel marries osmond is addressed with a pair of fantasy sequences which make the jarring suggestion that her tragic decision was the product of good old-fashioned lust . that notion might have been easier to stomach if osmond had been played by anyone other than john malkovich . malkovich has turned the aloof lothario into his stock character , but the portrayal has become more chilly than chilling . it is a perfectly valid interpretation to suggest that isabel had no choice ; it may also be the least interesting one . after hammering away at us with the restrictive nature of isabel's 19th century world for two and a half hours ( and at times you can feel every minute of it ) , it feels like a cheat for her to rehash the same point when addressing the most compelling enigma the novel has to offer . it is all the more frustrating because there are so many other things the portrait of a lady does right . with the exception of malkovich , the casting is superb , including nicole kidman as the wide-eyed innocent abroad with the eraserhead hairdo . barbara hershey and screenwriter laura jones to a particularly fine job with madame merle , a complex creature of uncertain motivations . de merteuil to malkovich's recycled valmont . martin donovan is also quite good as the consumptive , kind-hearted ralph , and mary-louise parker has a delightful bluntness as isabel's american friend henrietta . the production offers a variety of pleasures , notably stuart dryburgh's impressive photography , but campion flattens the most involving stories in the portrait of a lady . james' clash of american and european sensibilities becomes campion's clash of 19th century and 20th century sensibilities . the result is essentially a cautionary tale which only matters if you plan on doing any time travel , or a film treatment of a hypothetical prequel :  smart women who make foolish choices : the early years .

"screenplay : becky johnston , based on the memoir by heinrich harrer . director : jean-jacques annaud . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , violence , profanity ) running time : 137 minutes . if you accept hollywood's version of things , history -- particularly the uglier parts of history -- is what happens while white people are watching . it's not terribly surprising , since studios generally balk at anything remotely depressing ; fears can be allayed if an established anglo actor anchors such projects . so we end up with revolution in south america through the eyes of james woods in salvador , the plight of native americans as seen by kevin costner in dances with wolves , upheaval in burma as it affects patricia arquette in beyond rangoon . . . not one of them a terrible film , but each one compromised by the sense that we couldn't be trusted to identify with a dark face . in fact , these stories aren't even about the culture involved . there is a lot to like about individual moments , technical skill and overall atmosphere in seven years in tibet . an early mountain-climbing sequence is tense and restrained , the location photography is spectacular , and the performances of thewlis and wangchuk ( enchanting as the wise yet playful dalai lama ) are solid and appealing . the relationship between heinrich and the dalai lama is the most effective element in the film , smartly rendered by becky johnston's script . it takes a while for seven years to reach that relationship , but it's well-developed once it becomes the film's focus . it's often hard to see that focus , however , because seven years in tibet is an epic which feels like it's rushing frantically from place to place . there's a lot of ground to cover in harrer's story , probably more than 135 minutes can cover , but that's all we get . rather than finding the solid narrative through-line and sticking with it , the script hunts and pecks for dramatic events over a decade of time . of course , seven years' narrative through-line is the emotional and spiritual growth of harrer , so it's hard to say whether that would have been an improvement . it's not that pitt does a bad job as harrer , though his austrian accent wanders from here to there . in fact , he does a fine job of making harrer more than just a cocky rascal ; he's thoroughly self-absorbed to the point of needing a good spanking . but pitt could give the performance of a lifetime , and we'd still be left with a film which doesn't seem to have its priorities straight . it's true that even a sweeping story needs a protagonist to give broad-scale suffering a human face , but that face doesn't have to be topped by a head of blond hair . if seven years in tibet had not attempted to be more than the biography of an interesting man , i might have enjoyed it much more . instead , its attempts to be a  message  film end up delivering the wrong messages . while the chinese conquest of tibet warrants about five minutes of screen time in seven years in tibet , harrer's project building a movie theater for the dalai lama gets twice that . it's ironic , in a way : even within the film , the media of the west threaten to overwhelm another culture . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line  subscribe  .

"i don't usually do reviews of older movies , but patton happened to be playing in a local  revival  theater and , although i've seen the film many times on tv and video , i'd never before viewed it on a large screen . as a result , i took this opportunity to see it and subsequently write a review . by the way , for years now , i have considered patton to be my favorite all-time motion picture . what that says about my character , you can guess for yourself . . . .  through the travail of ages midst the pomp and toils of war , have i fought and strove and perished countless times upon a star . as if through a glass , and darkly , the age-old strife i see , for i fought in many guises , many names , but always me .  capturing eight oscars--including best picture , best director , best actor , best screenplay , best editing , and best production design--the movie won every major battle of the evening . such acclaim was richly deserved , for patton remains to this day one of hollywood's most compelling biographical war pictures . with its larger-than-life , yet at the same time singularly human , portrayal of gen . george s . patton , jr . , franklin schaffner's picture is an example of filmmaking at its finest . from production design and battle choreography to simple one-on-one dramatic acting , patton has it all . there is no scene in all one-hundred seventy minutes that doesn't work on some level . the news media of the time vilified him for this , and the history books have been little more kind . that single act , more than anything , typified the national perception of him . that side of the man is shown in patton , but there are more facets to the general's personality than what he presented in public . in its evenhanded presentation , patton does justice to those aspects of the general's character , in addition to the more obvious ones . into the role stepped george c . scott , giving the performance of a long and impressive career . indeed , scott became so identified with the character , and played the general so perfectly , that the patton of documentaries has since occasionally been referred to as  an imposter .  in a part that requires a skillful scaling of the emotional ladder , scott finds the perfect balance between bombast and subtlety . it is no exaggeration to say that , in the decade of the seventies , only men like brando , pacino , nicholson and de niro equalled what scott accomplished in patton . with the exception of patton , the only character given more than cursory attention is omar bradley , who is shown to be a conservative , level-headed antithesis to patton's impulsive , ill-tempered bluster . bradley begins the film serving under patton , and ends it as his superior . as bradley says ,  i do this job because i've been trained to do it . you do it because you love it .  the statement that patton  is [his] own worst enemy  is proven repeatedly . patton manages the intricate task of presenting personal details in the larger context of their historical backdrop . fred koenkamp's photography does justice to the picture's material . not only does he have a good sense of how to capture a battle on film , but he is equally adept at framing the quieter , more personal moments . jerry goldsmith's fine--and immediately recognizable--score compliments koenkamp's cinematography . those who have not seen patton , or who have not watched the film carefully , might assume that this movie is about world war two and one of its most celebrated generals . what patton sets out to do is to demythicize its subject and show the forces that drove this man . brilliant tactician , merciless disciplinarian , tireless fighter , prima donna , and staunch patriot--patton was all of these things and more .
