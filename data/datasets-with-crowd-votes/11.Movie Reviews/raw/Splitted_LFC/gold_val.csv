"the summer of 1995 has been a good season for so-called family films . a number of features aimed primarily at children have held their own with a more mature crowd . in the words of kristy ( impressive newcomer schuyler fisk ) , the club's founder , "" we're more than just a club -- we're friends -- best friends . and nothing will ever change that . "" character development is virtually non-existent , with the personalities of seven girls , three boys , and a few adults being painted with the broad strokes that define stereotypes . ultimately , this looks and feels like a made-for-tv movie or an after school special . the direction by thirtysomething cast member mayron is unimaginative , and the script recycles all kinds of cliched situations and facile solutions . for the most part , the baby-sitters club wants to teach its viewers the value of friendship , but the message comes across with sledgehammer subtlety in the midst of a sickeningly- sweet shower of goodwill . this is too much like a '90s version of the brady bunch . some will argue that i'm being too hard on the baby-sitters club . it is , after all , likely to work for the niche it's aimed at . on a more objective basis , though , the film doesn't succeed as a comedy , fantasy , or drama . fans and would-be fans of ann m . martin's books may be enthralled , but , for the rest of us , the baby-sitters club is something of an endurance contest .

"to be fair , she has always exhibited more range that she has been given credit for ( witness her triple performance in joe versus the volcano or her gender-bender in prelude to a kiss ) , but most directors have been happy to stick her into a formula and let her effervesce . maggie is a bad girl , although not quite as bad as she'd like everyone to believe . why is she so abrasive ? despite some totally unnecessary , minor believability issues ( for example , a telescope that can pick out faint stars during daylight hours and a truck that's allowed to ride alongside a plane down a runway ) , addicted to love boasts a smart , sassy script that risks showing its protagonists doing some exceptionally nasty things . if there's a sense of martin scorsese's after hours here , it's no coincidence . and , while it's obvious to even the most obtuse viewer that sam and maggie are going to end up together at the end , there are enough clever turns along the way to keep us interested . their romance really forms the coda to a deliciously nasty , dark comedy . international star tcheky karyo ( la femme nikita ) and kelly preston ( last seen in jerry maguire ) are effective , if a little underused , as the film's second pairing . addicted to love isn't likely to ascend to the lofty box office pinnacle attained by ryan's when harry met sally or sleepless in seattle , but it probably won't fall to the depths of i . q . or french kiss . it's kind of fun seeing the actress suppress her usual mannerisms and do the grunge thing , but not nearly as enjoyable as it is immersing oneself in dunne's bizarre-yet-oddly-engaging romantic comedy about voyeurism , moldy strawberries , and monkeys wearing lipstick . addicted to love is for those who don't mind a world view that's a little askew , yet who can still accept that love conquers all .

"screenplay : andrew w . marlowe . director : peter hyams . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , nudity , sexual situations , adult themes ) . running time : 118 minutes . for about ten seconds , there is the faint hope that end of days is clued in to its own absurdity . it's a nice line , and it couldn't come at a more crucial time . for over an hour , end of days fairly drowns in preposterousness . it's the kind of film where a suspect is found carrying a matchbook that leads jericho directly to important clues , and where the same suspect also has something jericho cleverly intuits is christine's name carved into his stomach . after sixty minutes of painful head smacking , i was ready for that glimmer of hope . maybe , just maybe , it was time to start having some fun with the end of the world as we know it . this , however , is a supernatural thriller that takes itself far too seriously . one assumes this is meant to be a chance for schwarzenegger to stretch his serious actor muscles in a plot line ready-made for a little redemption ( christine owns a music box just like his daughter had , in case the surrogate daughter angle was too obscure for you ) . turning end of days into a character piece is a mistake ; letting schwarzenegger play that character is flat-out foolish . it probably seemed like a good idea at the time , since there's also plenty of gun-firin' , helicopter-danglin' , subway car-explodin' action . some of it is even pretty lively , including the early chase sequence in which a suspended schwarzenegger pursues a sniper over a rooftop . there's also quite a bit of unpleasant brutality in the form of snapped necks , severed jugular veins and punched-out vital organs . it's not that you expect satan to be a nice guy -- indeed , gabriel byrne plays him effectively as a smug libertine with a _very_ short temper -- but that it's hard to settle in and enjoy end of days as an adventure thriller when so much is treated as grim and portentous . and that's really the fatal flaw of end of days : it never decides on an appropriate tone . if we're expected simply to enjoy the carnage , it's foolish to make the hero a lost soul . if we're expected to take the dark scenario seriously , the ridiculous plot contrivances make that impossible . end of days could have been effective either as a genre goof or as edgy seven-esque millennial creep show . instead , it's a murky dud that tries to chuckle its way out of the corner it writes itself into . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

""" we're gonna be too big for hamburg . we're gonna be too big for liverpool . we're gonna be too big for our own bloody good . "" oliver stone probably loves this film . not only is backbeat a story from "" his "" era , the early sixties , but it bears more than a passing resemblance to one of his own pictures , the doors ( although it should be noted that backbeat moves a lot faster ) . if nothing else , however , stone usually gets his characters right , but the failure to create a compelling protagonist is this movie's greatest flaw . i would have enjoyed backbeat more if i had begun to feel something for any of the men or women populating this tale . however , since director iain softley seems more interested in establishing tone and atmosphere than in creating vibrant personalities , he is unable to harness the full power of his story . in fact , the script itself is not tightly-focused , although the lack of a strong lead character could in part be responsible for this . while backbeat does , to some extent , fulfill both of these goals , it does neither to full advantage . when the film works , it's because the two purposes complement each other ; when it fails , it's because they are at odds . mr . softley uses an almost-documentary style of filmmaking , complete with unusual camera angles and often-dark settings , to bring home the immediacy of his motion picture . this is successful more often than not , but it could be argued that this method aids in further distancing the characters from the audience . music--rock 'n roll in particular--saturates backbeat . it has the most thunderous soundtrack since that of the commitments and , if marketed right , will sell tons of cds and tapes . nevertheless , all the visual and audio flare--and the tremendous energy that goes with them--can't quite make up for those elements where the film is found lacking . what makes it even more surprising that the characters have such little magnetism is that , for the most part , the actors portraying them do excellent jobs . other than having a somewhat variable accent , stephen dorff is fine as stu sutcliffe and , excepting a single over-the-top scene , twin peaks sheryl lee does a credible job playing astrid . ian hart gives an amazingly energetic and powerful rendering of john lennon . movies like backbeat are often the most difficult for me to review . i recognize the craft used in making the film , i admire the intent , and i like the music . the problem is , the characters don't grab me , and the story meanders a little too much to limit the importance of these minimalist personalities . many will doubtless feel differently , especially those with a special interest in the early days of the fab four . it's too bad this film didn't do as good a job capturing the other elements surrounding the group as they did those two aspects .

"two absolute top-rated films , dances with wolves and the fugitive have been fused together by first time writer and director tab murphy to create the derivative last of the dogmen . this is a serious show that has quotes in its advertising that claim it is the movie that dances with wolves should have been . as the icing on the cake in this show , the narrator ( wilford brimley ) is given language by the writer that is either poetic language that is brilliantly evocative of an earlier age or total , pompous balderdash . you can choose . at first , i liked the flowery language , but soon i got sugar overload and found his cute little sayings sickeningly sweet . i suspect the viewers of this show will dichotomize into the lovers and the loathers . i found the show not to be a bad one , but merely one that rarely lived up to its potential . read the review with an open mind for you may be less cynical than i and may be awe struck by its beauty . the movie is full of one cliche after another . and so on . to give you a flavor of the cliched dialog you have to endure , gates tells the professor that she can not come along with him into the wilderness because : "" i've seen this place reduce grown men to tears . it ain't no place for a woman . "" the movie is extremely predictable . with a title like last of the dogmen , do you think they will find a lost indian tribe ? well , that sure settled that . there are some wonderful parts of the show . first , the dog zip who is played by zip is the sort of a friendly mongrel that every kid would love to have . too bad he is not in all of them . this part shows how strong this show could have been . the movie is set in the big sky area of montana . it spends a lot of time explaining the history of the place and of the indian tribes there . as you watch the gorgeous waterfalls and snow capped mountains all filmed in lovely , slightly hazy and overcast images by karl walter lindenlaub , you want to leave this mediocre show and go immediately and book a flight to montana . well , if you did , please call your travel agent back . oh well , maybe the rockies were booked that summer . beside the great cinematography and nice sets ( trevor williams ) , the music ( david arnold ) is quite dramatic . i wish the actors had gotten a chance to hear the music so they would have been more inspired . berenger and hershey are mediocre at best . the indian actors are never challenged and so show us little in the way of acting . overall , the problem in the movie is that it takes itself way too seriously . i kept waiting for murphy to lighten things up a bit . there is a great opportunity for a real romance between the leads , but not in this serious show . a little more realism and humanity would have helped . there is a single , token scene thrown in where the indians are having a comedy fest , but that scene came out of left field and did not fit with the tone of the rest of the film . not surprising , the end is overly dramatic and the least interesting and most predicable part of the plot . among many of its implausibility's , why when disaster is eminent would people set around and slowly converse about alternatives . they looked not like a tribe of warriors , but a bunch of octogenarian professors sitting around debating what to do while the building they are in is being set on fire . give these warriors some energy , please ! the narrator admonishes the audience that "" sometimes you have to put your faith in what you can't see . in what you wish . "" i guess my body was low on faith when i went to see last of the dogmen since its 1 : 59 was way too long for me . it is rated pg for 2 kisses , some arrow in the back type of violence , and adult themes . it has no nudity or partial nudity , and no sex . it would be fine for kids over say 9 , and there were a couple of kids that age with their parents behind me . although there is a great dog , a nice mystery , beautiful scenery , and impressive music , i can not recommend this movie to you . it rates * 1/2 in my book . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : septmeber 15 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"cast : djimon hounsou , matthew mcconaughey , morgan freeman , anthony hopkins , nigel hawthorne , stellan skarsgard , david paymer , pete postlethwaite , anna paquin director : steven spielberg producers : steven spielberg , debbie allen , and colin wilson screenplay : david franzoni cinematography : janusz kaminski music : john williams u . s . distributor : dreamworks skg here's a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler's list is to jurassic park . in 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler's list as the director's "" penance "" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster ) . once again , his summer release was special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers . that film is amistad . although not as masterful as schindler's list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture . thematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact . watching schindler's list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience . spielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later . aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since . amistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent . the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that's not a surprise . several , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film's dramatic force . on the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired . at its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage . effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies . they are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie's success . to amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans' point-of-view , detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the white man's seemingly-strange "" rituals "" . amistad's presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history . aside from cinque , who is a fully-realized individual , characterization is spotty , but the acting is top-notch . likewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than "" abolitionists . "" nigel hawthorne , who played the title character in the madness of king george , presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election . finally , there's anthony hopkins , whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done . hopkins , who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer , an emotionally-crippled english butler , and richard nixon , makes us believe that he is adams . one point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler's list is this film's lack of a well-defined human villain . schindler's list had ralph fiennes' superbly-realized amon goeth , who was not only a three-dimensional character , but a personification of all that the nazis stood for . there is no such figure in amistad . the villain is slavery , but an ideology , no matter how evil , is rarely the best adversary . it is to spielberg's credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist . amistad's trek to the screen , which encountered some choppy waters ( author barbara chase-riboud has cried plagiarism , a charge denied by the film makers ) , comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident . numerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves . it remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has , but one thing is certain -- with spielberg's rousing , substantive film leading the way , the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history . - ingmar bergman ",1
"it is considered by many to be a classic movie and is the first part of director satyajit ray's "" apu trilogy .

"" and all this is accomplished with an appropriate level of pomposity . mighty aphrodite , woody allen's 1995 film , lacks the brilliance and hilarity of his two previous efforts ( manhattan murder mystery and bullets over broadway ) , but it's not bad as a lightweight one-hundred minutes at the movies . thematically , the film is pretty thin , unless you consider that everyone's life can resemble a greek tragedy in one way or another . allen appears determined to craft a motion picture that can be laughed at without plumbing any especially deep neuroses of the human condition . woody allen really only has one on-screen personality , and he plays it here as usual , although , at this point in his career , he's getting a bit old for roles better suited to someone twenty years his junior . the only noticeable acting blot on mighty aphrodite is michael rapaport , who displays the same lack of range and energy he showed in higher learning . since , in bullets over broadway , jennifer tilly earned an oscar nomination for an inferior portrayal of a character of similar intelligence , sorvino deserves at least that much--if not more . this is a star-making outing by one of america's top young actresses . the most original element of mighty aphrodite is the use of the greek chorus . however , what starts out as a clever , innovative device quickly becomes tedious through overuse . at times , it's as if woody allen is attempting to take a page out of the monty python book , and those two very different styles of humor do not mix well . while not up to the level of many of allen's recent films , mighty aphrodite is nevertheless an entertaining diversion . the comedy , most of which is light and easily accessible , is worthy of some laughs , and the movie has a good sense of irony . mighty aphrodite is far from a tour de force , and some woody allen die-hards may be disappointed , but there's enough in this picture to recommend it .

"a modern noir story whose task seems to be to romanticize violence , with the film looking too much , at times , like a tarantino-clone . but there are scenes that are fresh and invigorating , filled with a deadly explosiveness , but somehow the film fails to put it all together to get at what it is trying to unearth from all the gunplay . it looked at that point , that the film would be very energetic , since that scene was so powerful and so crass -- and original . but the filmmaker fell in love with the violence and couldn't control his bad impulses to do the entire film as an exercise in mindless violence . armed with a highly polished script , lots of arty gunfights , and a convoluted , labyrinth story line , more interested in double-crosses and twists in the plot than human feelings , the film turned off on too many dead-ends to fulfill its potential . if you like gunplay done as choreography , as in recent hong kong action films or in sam peckinpah's "" the wild bunch , "" and films that prefer violence to sex , action to thinking , and films that discard humor for references that film buffs can go bananas over , a film that models itself after classic movies of criminals on-the-run , then you could be on board for this one , at least , more than other viewers who might find this film is not as good as the films it is imitating . parker and longbaugh are the real-life surnames of butch cassidy and the sundance kid . a shapeless story and an unmoving character portrayal of its anti-heroes get in the way of "" the way of the gun "" for director-writer christopher mcquarrie , who won an academy award for his unusual script in the overrated "" the usual suspects . "" he has come up with a reasonably intricate script here for his debut film as a director , but it lacks a certain flow and credibility for it to be a bravura debut . there was a stop-and-go flurry in the action causing the story to grow dull , with guns always the answer to whatever the problem , and its situations took on a suspension of disbelief , leaving a huge void onscreen amid the dark ambivalence of the story line . but what was always absorbing was the actors spouting lines that seemed to come out of their mouths in an unnatural manner , yet had a touch of playfulness , as they mugged for the camera . unfortunately , the film doesn't have any touching moments to fall back on and there is no one worth caring about , so in the midst of all the violence , it is fair to ask what is it all about , besides being a parody on such films . the violence and gore that ensues , plus the twists to the story , offer no big surprises . in fact , it almost seems like hundreds of other "" b "" films , contrary to what the director might think . his role took him in and out of the film , as it didn't seem to matter what he was spouting , he could have been doing the script to another film it wouldn't have mattered , he still was the film's source of charisma even if he was cast in a supporting role . i was amused with his definition of karma , saying karma is just a belief in justice where you don't even get the pleasure of seeing justice in your lifetime . it's an inaccurate definition of karma , but it was one spot in the film that made you think . but basically this is the type of film that gives ammunition to those who are bashing hollywood for its exploitive tendencies to sell violence . in the last third of the film juliette lewis is a bloody mess , having a baby all the characters pretend to have an interest in , even the fatalistic parker becomes concerned about the baby , but while she is having an excruciatingly painful delivery , one of the film's many shoot-outs is taking place . it seemed the film was more interested in the shoot-outs than in getting to anything else to say . the film was pleasing in the most superficial of ways without offering anything to say about the inner workings of the two thugs who are the centerpiece of the film . the camerawork was superb , and even though the gunplay was phony it filled the screen with stylized action scenes that were mindlessly diverting . the film could be viewed as a guilty pleasure for those who realize that the script let them down but the actors came through with flying colors . they got the graphic violence down pat for a few sparkling thrills , and the film showed that violence is so pervasive in society that even a woman gets punched in the nose by the gunmen , which i guess , goes for equality in this film ! a film that has future cult popularity written all over its ambivalent signature , as the violence had an unsettling nature to it that will probably grow on art-house viewers of thrillers who will catch it on video . there is something intangible about this film that is a reflection of present day society and its ever-increasing nihilistic ways . what the film doesn't do , is go beyond exploiting this nihilism .

"temptress moon ( feng yue ) is a cinematic tone poem from director kaige chen . chen , whose last work was the highly regarded farewell my concubine , contents himself this time with dazzling the audience with a film of stunning beauty . populated by characters who are little more than window dressing , the picture delights the senses , but rarely involves the viewers . the characters are mere portraits on chen's mantle with the viewers becoming voyeurs into the two dimensional world he creates . the obtuse script by kaige chen , kei shu , and anyi wang represents a challenge . like an opera , you need to read the plot outline ahead of time to keep the main characters straight , and even then , some of the minor ones will confuse you . after meticulously following the story , i realized in the end that it didn't matter . the movie's enjoyment comes from its visuals , so concentrating on the plot is a pointless diversion . nevertheless , i will describe some of story's highlights . the movie opens in china in 1911 . from its first scenes the movie overwhelms us with its nostalgic and romantic cinematography . the large and lush green leaves of the plants cut through the darkness as the boat plies its way forward . the pangs are cast as the timothy learys of that era . the story has gotten quite complicated by this point , but don't worry about it . just lean back and enjoy qiagui huang's handsome sets , listen to jiping zhao's longing music , admire william chang and chen changmin's gorgeous costumes and , most of all , soak in the radiance of christopher doyle's incredible cinematography . granted , the film does not have the beauty of shanghai triad , but it comes close . certainly , any film starring as lovely an actress as gong li ( to live and shanghai triad ) is worth seeing for that reason alone . the camera loves her , and , even if she demonstrates little of her considerable acting talent in temptress moon , she has a picture perfect smile . tone poems must be short to be effective . temptress moon wears out its welcome and goes on long past its natural ending point . when the inevitable tragic end occurred , i found myself unmoved and merely glad the movie was finally over . what had started out pleasantly enough had become repetitive and tiresome . temptress moon runs too long at 2 : 00 . the film is in chinese with english subtitles . it would be fine for older teenagers , but i would worry that younger ones would not be able to see through the pro-drug beliefs of the pang family . i enjoyed watching the movie's visuals , but not enough to be able to recommend the film . i give it * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"having already self-cannibalized the 1961 animated 101 dalmatians in the successful 1996 live-action version , disney had to look for a more creative way to self-cannibalize in the sequel 102 dalmatians . how wonderfully romantic kevin and chloe's relationship must be . . . 102 dalmatians would have had to work hard to be as actively irritating as its john hughes-penned precursor . instead of being actively irritating , this one registers as merely tedious . like the first film , 102 dalmatians is designed primarily as a great big love-fest between the audience members and the on-screen animals . unfortunately , they're almost never asked to do anything more interesting than sit around and look cuddly . lima ( co-director of disney's tarzan , making his first live-action feature ) generally appears content to let the awww appeal of his canine co-stars take the place of action , adventure or humor . you've probably passed the age where 102 dalmatians would appeal to you if you no longer respond to puppies in a movie with a shriek of , "" puppies ! "" that same overwhelming sense of laziness permeates the film from start to finish . it's blessedly true that 102 dalmatians does not feature a single shot of someone getting his genitals electrocuted , or any mayhem that would bump the rating even to a pg . the slapstick is basically harmless stuff involving dogs biting villains in the rear or cruella's henchman/chauffeur ( tim mcinnerny ) injuring and reinjuring his hands . but there really isn't even all that much slapstick . there's a whole lot of exposition , and it doesn't lead up to anything . in a way , up until the final showdown on a bakery assembly line , it's all rather hypnotically pleasant -- no off-putting violence , no real peril , and no personality . there's also the romantic sub-plot involving kevin and chloe , two of the most blandly attractive characters committed to the screen since the last freddie prinze jr . movie . while close does her best to inject some life into the proceedings -- still playing cruella as a drag queen icon rather than a nasty villain -- the protagonists practically vanish into the background . like far too many sequels , this one just lies there limply , practically daring you not to grant it good will based on another movie . it's bad enough to do that when the other movie in question was successful , but lousy . it's even worse when the good will being traded upon comes from a truly classic cinematic moment . not even a clip from lady and the tramp can make 102 dalmatians worth anything more than a snore . and it doesn't help to prove that cute animated dogs are often preferable to cute real-life dogs . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"with the enormous popularity of reality-based television shows and of teenage sex comedies , jean pierre marois's american virgin would seem to have arrived at a perfect moment in time for its plot , a spoof of the live deflowering of a just turned 18-year-old virgin on a paid cable program . do you think that the renaming of the video , about to be released to your video stores , to so mimic suvari's more famous two roles might been have more than a coincidence ? suvari mixes virginal innocence with resolute toughness . opening with a starlet in a bikini who appears to be in the throws of sexual passion , the camera cuts back so that we can see the fakery involved . but wait ; there's more ! the plot has intentionally convoluted relationships among the characters . the film is a hard-driving parody . it is an intentionally over-the-top film that skewers every subject that it brings up . nothing is sacrosanct , but the "" adult film industry "" bears the brunt of the assault . "" if porn's good enough for you , it's good enough for me , "" katrina tells her dad when he orders her not to go through with it . "" listen , if this isn't art , i don't know what is , "" joey yells to his field of fornicators , ready to do the pregame show before the big deflowerment . actually , given its premise , the movie is remarkably tame with little sex or nudity . mainly the actors just talk about sex , and , even then , the language is milder than you would expect . american pie , for example , is much raunchier than american virgin . american virgin is the sort of film that most viewers will either find ridiculously awful or outrageously funny . my reaction proved , however , to be neither of these extremes . although i admired the director's audacious approach and was charmed by suvari's performance in a badly underwritten role , i found that too many of the jokes came across flat . the result is a picture that's better than might be expected but not quite good enough to recommend . it is rated r for sexual content , nudity and language and would be acceptable for most teenagers .

"screenplay : larry bishop . running time : 95 minutes . it is a tough call which annoying trend represented by mad dog time is more annoying . is it the cameo-rama , the insistence upon turning every scene into a celebrity "" where's waldo ?

"" however , in trying to combine ocean's eleven with reservoir dogs , bishop has cranked out a script with so much utterly ridiculous dialogue that you might not even notice that you don't care a thing about anyone or anything in mad dog time . gabriel byrne is the worst offender , trying to make his irish accent sound like brooklyn italian while blathering on about other characters in lines which mistake simple , inane rhymes and alliteration for cleverness . with nothing to say and a truly grating way of saying it , bishop resorts to trotting out cameos of guys who don't seem to belong on the same planet , let alone in the same movie . paul anka and richard pryor ( whose appearance seems not only unnecessary , but just plain cruel ) ? it doesn't matter that none of them has anything to do except show off a skin tone which , whether natural or induced by lighting or makeup , makes many of them look like prime candidates for the george hamilton memorial melanoma wing of cedars-sinai . at times , bishop seems to be making a desperate attempt to convince the audience that he is aware of the ludicrous excesses in mad dog time , giving goldblum a couple of meta-conscious lines which refer to characters , situations or dialogue . there are even a couple of moderately inspired moments , like having dreyfuss and reynolds , owners of two of the most distinctive laughs in hollywood , cackling away as they face each other . but when a film-maker spends this much time subjecting viewers to a story which exists only as a place to put his obnoxious rat pack stand-ins and have them mouth labored , grossly unfunny lines , he loses the right to pretend it's all a lark . the actors may have had fun playing versions of frankie , sammy , dean and the boys , but that fun isn't likely to be shared by an audience . mad dog time is a self-indulgent homage masquerading as hipster cinema . worse yet , it's like the cannonball run with cocktails and shark-skin .

"director sean penn and actor jack nicholson , who last collaborated in the over-the-top the crossing guard , surprise us this time with the pledge , a picture of remarkable grace and subtlety . the pledge focuses almost exclusively on jack nicholson as detective jerry black , although many fine actors show up to turn in nice cameos and supporting parts . or is he just lying in wait ? or is it both ? what is most unusual about the second half is that the script by jerzy kromolowski and mary olson-kromolowski , based on friedrich d ? rrenmatt's book , telegraphs where it is going yet maintains the tension . and , when the story finally gets to the easily guessed destination , the film avoids the most committed sin by screenwriters everywhere -- the obsession with tying up all the loose ends . this , of course , may drive anal-retentive viewers nuts , but it does provide for great post-theater car conversations . still , what you will remember a week later isn't the ending . it will be nicholson's exceptional and atypically reserved performance . his detective doesn't come from some overwrought method acting . his worries are made palpable through an intense but delicately nuanced performance by nicholson . it may not be his very best performance , but it sure is a treat to observe . it is rated r for strong violence and language and would be acceptable for older teenagers . in the silicon valley it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters .

"for someone who is a strict traditionalist when it comes to shakespeare , and to opera too for that matter , i was amazed at how much i was enthralled by ian mckellen's vision of richard iii as a world war ii british fascist . this is a well acted production where the images are even more impressive than the acting . usually when critics say the images are the best part of a movie , they are reviewing a mediocre show where the visuals are its redeeming feature . here they enhance an already outstanding production . as an aside , the theater where i saw the film had an overscan problem and the opening title clearly proclaimed the movie to be richard ii so i thought for a second i was going to see a prequel . after hating director oliver parker's recent and dreary rendition of othello , it was refreshing to see director richard loncraine breath such tremendous life-force into richard iii . no since the even better kenneth branagh's henry v and franco zeffirelli's romeo and juliet , have i enjoyed shakespeare so much . the film is based on shakespeare's play , but i believe many of the lines were either rearranged or abbreviated . i read that ian mckellen spent several years trying to sell various hollywood studios on the making of this film , but when the studios read the script , they kept saying that they hoped he made it , but they were not going to be the ones to fiance anything that bizarre . whether there is a big enough audience for a film like this to turn a profit is another question of course . in this speech and most others in the movie , it is pronounced and given nuances fresh and not found in most actors' shakespearean repertoire . the speech actually continues as nature calls , and richard leaves to use the urinal . in most movies i find contrivances like soliloquies in the bathroom to be silly at best , but mckellen's strength of acting manages to pull it off effectively . this is a fascinating and true story that averages a murder every five minutes , and thanks to great editing by paul green , the movie flies along . as richard says , "" plots have i laid . "" as the words moved fast and furiously , i realized why shakespeare is so unapproachable to a mass audience , it requires attention . unlike the sound bites of political campaigns or mtv , all thoughts are not delivered in short sentences full of monosyllabic words designed to let the brain stay on autopilot . i will not insult your intelligence by attempting a condensed version of the story here . instead i will concentrate on reviewing the film itself . the cast is full of good actors and actresses who are coached by the director to give some of their very best performances even though their roles may be quite minor . robert downey jr . , for example , plays rivers and has less than a dozen lines , but delivers them to great effect . adrian dunbar plays tyrell as a chilling man who has almost as few scruples as richard . jim broadbent has a larger ( pun intended ) role as buckingham , playing him as the herman goering of the picture . richard smiles deviously and replies with a sweet voice , "" you have a daughter . "" he quickly retorts in a melodious voice , "" yes , if the devil tempt you to do good . "" a chilling performance , but a bit hard to watch . now who else have i forgotten in this ensemble cast ? there is not a bad acting job in the movie . the best acting , and one worth many awards , is that of ian mckellen . in case you are curious , the "" a horse , a horse , my kingdom for a horse "" speech is delivered in a broken down jeep . the best part of the entire movie are the sets by tony burrough . the wide variety of costumes ( shuna harwood ) range from army uniforms reminiscent of the nazis to lush clothing for teas full of cream colors for the men and primary colors for the women . the cinematography ( peter biziou ) of hazy and shiny blues and greens with strong flesh tones adds a feeling of death and conniving around every corner . the last scene with the loud al jolson music is , well , a hoot . it is rated r for tastefully done violence , a little sex , very brief nudity , and one hard drug usage scene . i am sorry to say that it has massive smoking for no purpose . this show would be fine for teenagers , and i would strongly encourage them and anyone with an attention span longer than 15 seconds to see this film . it speaks to our time and every time . i gladly give the movie * * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"this is not an art movie , yet i saw it an art house theater . it is perfect for the mall , where teenagers experiencing brain drains can feel good about being mindless and not have to apologize that this is an american film , about that old cliche of young lovers relentlessly on the run . if seen at your friendly mall , you could , at least , be reassured that there is little chance of anyone trying to sneak it in as an art film , as was tried in the art house . rlr should make it apparent that other countries can make obnoxious films with banal and predictable characters just as readily as americans can . there is no substance in this fast food german meal , served up at a deliciously kinetic speed so that you have no time to think about how stupid the story is and how depraved the lead characters are , and what a lousy meal you have just had . the film is as deep as reading a daffy duck comic book or playing a road runner video game or watching a bugs bunny cartoon , and if that entertains you , then perhaps , i could recommend that you take a look at run lola run , it might be what you are looking for . it has the audacity to have in its opening credits a quote from t . s . in all probability , the blue-bloodied elliott would not have cared for this film- and to quote him and then have a film that has nothing in the world to do with his poem or with the quote , except to show that even these crass critters who created this film aspire to a higher art form , is simply a ridiculous attempt by them to try and achieve credibility when it is not necessary to do so , this film stands on its own four paws . these questions once asked on screen are , of course , never even attempted to be answered . though it would have been good comedic dialogue to have the two leads , lola ( franka potente ) and manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) , try to resolve these deep philosophical questions . what does take place is a soccer ball being kicked to open the action in the film , as the movie is supposed to be like a game , with the director making up the rules as he goes along . manni , not to be undone , sports a few nifty tattoos himself , while also taking on the punk look . the fun to this story , if you are going to have any , comes in following lola as she makes a run for it through spots that she will revisit three different times each for 20-minutes and with three different versions , before the film is over , as any one of the versions could be true or none of them could be true , it just doesn't matter . nothing matters , here . this is a disposable film , like junk food , when done you throw it in the waste can . needless to say , anything goes here ; this film does not try to make sense and it doesn't . its comedy is on the low end of the totem pole of comedy , though the old silent comedians , such as charlie chaplin and buster keaton did bits similar to this , but they had a logic to their madcap humor and knew how to tell a story in their comedy . there are so many films that tried this theme out for size , some successfully like rashomon ( 1950 ) , some modestly successful like blind chance ( 1982 ) , others less successfully , such as sliding doors ( 1998 ) , but none as unsuccessful as this one . at least this subtitled , low-budget film flew by quickly and leaves you no worst for wear after seeing it . . . it certainly didn't appeal to me ; i was just not smitten with its attempt to be such a cleverly edited , jejune summer film . and he replies , "" i just know .

"the american ad campaign for the film places jackie in a heroic pose in front of spandex-clad , gun-toting babes , a pre-opening credits sequence sets the stage with a few impressive stunts , and the opening credits themselves are full of silhouette images . anything sound familiar ? imagine , now , that in the course of mimicking one of the most iconic adventure series of the last thirty years , someone managed to improve on it . when the creative force behind the result is jackie chan , it's not a tremendous stretch of the imagination . operation condor is simply the most ridiculously entertaining action film to grace american screens this year , a dazzling combination of energetic comedy and virtuoso stunt work which shames the multi-million dollar detritus offered this summer by hollywood studios . and none of it really matters in the least , except to the extent that it provides a set-up for action sequences . that structure doesn't distinguish it much from most late-model bond films , or from the majority of late-model action films of any make . what does distinguish operation condor is the action it delivers -- not just big , loud and expensive action but inventive , thrilling and beautifully choreographed action . a jackie chan fight sequence can do something absolutely extraordinary in the jaded age of the blockbuster : it makes action seem original . you may spend half of operation condor's running time -- particularly the spectacular wind tunnel finale -- wearing the goofy expression of someone who can't believe he just saw that . you may spend the other half enjoying the presence of chan himself , though the bond analogy certainly breaks down at this point . chan is a lot of things on screen , but suave ain't one of them . you get the feeling you'd be more likely to see him in a cardigan and slippers than in an armani tuxedo ; he's like mr . rogers if he could do a spinning back kick . ( my apologies , fred , if you _can_ do a spinning back kick . ) yet it is exactly that polite , boyish charm which makes chan such a great action hero . he's in on the absurd joke of action films , but not in the raised eyebrow , quip-spewing way which passes for wit in other genre entries . chan is willing simply to laugh at himself , at the idea of a vulnerable nice guy who defeats his opponents with grace and style rather than with an uzi . there are a few clumsy transitions in operation condor , many the result of editing which trimmed almost twenty minutes from the original cut of armour of god ii , as well as predictably stiff supporting performances and grossly caricatured accents in the dubbed voices . operation condor is _fun_ , fun in a way which should make people embarrassed for using the same word to describe con air or the lost world . if i were pierce brosnan , i'd be looking over my shoulder right about now . chan . calling a critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist .

"i was born , but . . . the shochiku kamata studio specialized in nonsense comedies , something the great director , one of the world's most acclaimed , yasujiro ozu ( the tokyo story/late spring/floating weeds ) was keen on doing during this period of his film career , when he refused to make talkies until yielding in 1935 , but continued to make silent social comedies , somewhat in the style and equal to in quality to the charlie chaplin and buster keaton films , though ozu's films were seen through the eyes of children rather than taken from the adult's point of view . they were ably co-scripted by the master of the nonsense film , akira fushimi . in i was born , but . . . , a film with lots of sight-gags , made as a social comedy turning darker as the story got a bit more involved with the patriarch of the family , mr . yoshii ( tatsuo saito ) . this splendid example of a salaryman's film , is the first great film of the master's , with many others to follow . there is a comic sandal fight among the boys , which brings out the film's visual humor from the way the framing of the shots magnifies the synchronized reactions of the two fighters . in fact , ozu's camera angles for adults when talking to children , are always taken from a higher elevation so that the adults are talking down to the children , always in a position of superiority . ozu draws the analogy of the workplace power structure to the way children naturally socialize , and states that the adults power is vindictively social , derived from one's station in life and how much money one has . the home movies become unbearably embarrassing to watch for yoshii and the children , as yoshii acts the part of the clown in them and is seen as an obviously inferior man than his boss . yoshii , himself , is embarrassed that he has to lower himself so much , but he is secretly pleased that he is so successful as a clown and can make everybody laugh . taro's only comment is , your father is really funny . ozu' other purpose of showing the home film , being always the gagman , it also gives him a chance to parody his own way of shooting films by having the home movie filmed in the same style he uses for this movie , such as by using the same tracking shots and camera height angles . the wry salaryman responds , "" if i didn't , i wouldn't get paid and you wouldn't eat . "" the boys illusion is that all power can be won through one's talents . but in the business world , the boss doesn't have to possess those character traits , he is the boss because that is the way society is structured , and it pays to submit to that hierarchy or else you will be left out in the cold to fend for yourself . the "" but "" in the film's title comes into place , as it indicates that everyone is born equal , "" but "" that changes soon enough . there is always something to disturb the stability assumed from the outset . it is now clear that yoshii grovels because he can't do anything else about it . and like many parents in america , he only wishes his children have a better life than he does , which draws him closer to the audience and presents him in a more sympathetic light . the plot of the film is encompassed within a short five-day period , and it parallels in a didactic way the social structure of the children and the grownups , and how in each group adjustments have to be made in order to survive , with the majority of the film being concerned about how the boys start growing up . the adult world is mainly used as a expansion of the boys' limited horizons .

"these scenes between the cops and the hysterical youth are classic noir ones and are what give the film its very dark edge . this was a dark tale and could have been made more interesting if it cut away from father roth's saintly but unconvincing role and followed through more on the story as it was written by philip yordan from leo brady's novel . the potential was there for a great film . censorship was the curse of the 1950s for films , and this good priest-bad priest part of the story unfortunately turns out to be an exercise in self-righteousness , unwisely tacked onto a perfectly good story .

"starring : wesley snipes , michael wright , theresa randle , abe vigoda , clarence williams iii , ernie hudson director : leon ichaso producers : rudy langlais and gregory brown screenplay : barry michael cooper music : terence blanchard released by twentieth-century fox sugar hill , a moody , atmospheric tale of violence and drugs on the streets of modern-day harlem , moves along too slowly for its own good . while the story doesn't score points for originality , the themes addressed are important and immediate , and ultimately it's a failure in execution that keeps this film from joining the ranks of a number of recent , memorable pictures chronicling life on the streets and in the ghettos . with a brooding jazz score and dark , gloomy cinematography that highlights shadows , sugar hill is a masterpiece of atmosphere . it has a stylish feel that lends a romanticized aura to its depiction of gangsters and violence . this film does not have the punch-in-the-guts realism of a boyz 'n the hood or a menace ii society , nor does it have the quality or scope of the godfather . the 40s aura allows us to keep all but the most brutal moments of sugar hill at arm's length . the tale of a high-ranking criminal trying to go straight has been the central focus of numerous movies . if done right , it can be a fascinating topic . sugar hill , however , having decided on the premise , can't figure out how to execute it . the script meanders for nearly two hours , with numerous scenes dragging on for too long . there is rarely any tension or energy--of either the dramatic or action-oriented variety . presumably , one of the reasons for the uneven , plodding tone is to allow for character development . in that , the filmmakers have underestimated their first half-hour . a quarter of the way into the film , romillo and ray are already fully fleshed out . the additional talky scenes add little to the relationship or the individuals , and romillo's constant repetition of the refrain "" i've got to get out of here "" becomes tedious . wesley snipes , who appears capable of playing almost any sort of character , from action hero to paraplegic , turns in another capable performance as romillo . this is certainly not his best role , but the actor understands the character whose identity he has taken on , and manages to present a man capable of capturing the audience's sympathy without compromising the essence of his personality . the weak link in the film may be michael wright , who plays ray . only occasionally convincing , mr . wright picks one of the most inopportune moments to act beyond the boundaries of believability : the all-important climactic moment . this rather heavy-handed scene had the misfortune of receiving a smattering of unintentional laughter within the darkened confines of the theater where i viewed the film . the moral of sugar hill is "" don't do drugs , "" and this message is presented in an obvious and uninspired manner . still , this picture's most obvious flaw has nothing to do with its sermonizing . the problem lies instead with its somniferous pacing . sugar hill moves with all the speed of molasses .

"how many different spins have their been on the "" buddy film "" ? >from the odd couple to lethal weapon , it seems that just about every angle on this subject has been covered . then along comes a movie like guarding tess that thinks it has a unique twist to this tried-and-true theme . however , an unusual pairing doesn't equate to a noteworthy picture . driving miss daisy did it much better , but there are some shared themes between the 1989 academy award winning film and hugh wilson's guarding tess . this , the central theme of every "" buddy film , "" lies at the core of guarding tess . the story is not especially original . mostly predictable , guarding tess is light on surprises , but that's a given for any film that falls even loosely into a formula category . slow to start with , the movie eventually slips into a flow , but the ending is burdened by a poorly-reasoned and rather silly kidnapping subplot . don't think too hard during this part , because a lot of what goes on doesn't make much sense . the comedy is mostly low-key , and much of it works . coming from writer/director hugh wilson , the man behind the original police academy , it's nice to find a motion picture whose laugh-to-joke ratio is relatively high . guarding tess relies far more on verbal jousting and body language than on slapstick and other ridiculous gags . nicolas cage carries the movie . the energy and audience involvement all come as a result of his engaging performance . normally know for his manic on-screen antics , it's interesting to see mr . cage play a restrained role . the rest of the cast , including such familiar names as austin pendleton and james rebhorn , provide fine supporting work . ultimately , while guarding tess is a genial comedy that provides a reasonable ninety-five minutes' entertainment , it's sadly lacking in originality . there are a few good jokes , some nice chemistry between the two leads , a little character development , and a little pathos , but it all doesn't add up to very much . the ingredients are there , but the final product wasn't prepared to its best advantage .

"following on the heels of "" the exorcist "" , "" the omen "" is another box-office success , one of many commercial horror thrillers spawned in the 1970s , and much better critically than most others . it is even a more satisfying film than the exorcist . what makes this film so captivating , is how it relies on narrative and not special effects to build on tension . this adorable cherub turns out to be none other than the antichrist . or maybe , by taking the bible literally , that can become a problem . how this film gets to hold its head higher than most of the other films of this nature , is because the acting is first-class , the telling of the story is tight , and the criss-crossing between london , rome , and jerusalem , is suspenseful . the film is in constant motion , so it is made difficult to stop and think , and reflect how much hokum there is in the story . so , i can't really blame the very prudish and politically sensible thorn for not believing the priest . this gets thorn's attention , at last . all this leaves the ambassador befuddled , looking only as gregory peck can look , when things that are supposed to make sense don't . while in jerusalem , there are a few more shocks , and the story excitedly swings back to london . here , a few more shocks develop . the film succeeds because it knows how to tell a suspenseful story and not rely on green vomit for its shocks , like the exorcist resorted to , as the omen manages to have its shocks look sensible and seem convincing .

"screenplay : kenneth branagh , based on the play by william shakespeare . director : kenneth branagh . kenneth branagh's hamlet is the first film version of shakespeare's revered tragedy to use the full , uncut text , and you know what that means : before you settle into your theater seat , smoke 'em if you got 'em , be sure to use the restroom , and bring extra quarters for parking . this hamlet is 238 minutes long -- 258 including the intermission -- making it one of the longest films ever produced for theatrical distribution . it is a terribly risky undertaking , but branagh has proven once again that the bard is safe in his hands . his hamlet does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how much is lost in edited versions of the play , re-vitalizing characterizations and offering a visual spectacle . it is a worthy challenger to laurence olivier's 1948 hamlet as the definitive film interpretation of the text . that bare bones synopsis cannot even begin to do justice to the complexity of hamlet , of course , but neither do many abbreviated film and stage versions . branagh's use of the entire text proves to be far more than a purist conceit , as he reveals additional layers of meaning . this hamlet is richer than any other you might have known because every piece of sub-text remains in the text . it is also a version which uses the unique opportunities of cinema better than any other . branagh has an instinct for excess in his film direction , but his dedication to shakespeare has anchored his adaptations of henry v and much ado about nothing where mary shelley's frankenstein and dead again occasionally got away from him . combining creative interpretive choices for the characters ( polonius [richard briers] becomes more malevolent and hypocritical as he is shown with a prostitute before sending someone to check up on laertes in france ) with superb technical credits ( tim harvey's dazzling production design and alex byrne's elegant , evocative 19th century costumes ) , branagh adds another thoroughly cinematic shakespeare to his resume . his direction may be nearly unimpeachable , but there are other areas where branagh's "" more is more "" philosophy are a hindrance . the casting of several familiar faces in minor roles feels more like a stunt than an artistic choice , and while crystal and charlton heston ( as the player king ) in particular are surprisingly effective in their roles , the effect is more often to turn hamlet into a hollywood sight-seeing tour : "" look , there's gerard depardieu ! look , there's robin williams ! "" branagh's lead performance is also distracting , and not because he makes poor character choices ( unless his bleached-blond hair counts ) ; the problem is that he is playing to the balcony even though he is on a movie screen . there may be one too many scenes in which spittle flies from the thin lips of his impassioned hamlet , and while branagh has a firm grasp of the dane's lighter side , his emoting is often forced . still , it is hard to come down too hard on a man who not only committed himself to the most challenging role in the history of theater , but directed an epic period production of the most challenging play in the history of theater . branagh took an exceptional gamble , and it paid off in an exceptional film . take a chance on spending 238 minutes to stretch your understanding of this remarkable play ; you can always stretch your legs during the intermission .

"date released : varies running length : 2 : 00 rated : nr ( sex , nudity , violence , mature themes ) starring : misa shimizu , takehiro murata , takeo nakahara director : takehiro nakajima producer : takehiro nakajima screenplay : takehiro nakajima music : hiroshi ariyoshi released by cinevista japanese with english subtitles first and foremost , okoge is an examination of the difficulties faced by gay men in a society as conservative and restrictive as that in japan . actually , many of the themes of the movie , as well as the problems encountered by the main characters , have universal implications . too often , one of the problems with movies involving homosexual themes and issues is a tendency to sermonize . instead of letting the characters and story bring the message to the fore , each of those films felt it necessary to preach about the evils of a homophobic society . for the most part , okoge avoids this pitfall . there are a few scenes that are too obviously scripted ( such as one in which a bunch of gay men sit around debating whether their sexual preference is the result of genetics or environment ) , but the movie generally allows the natural flow of its plot to explore issues , rather than relying on unconvincing contrivances . okoge also has a sense of humor . not a deadly-serious movie , this is instead a picture that is unafraid to let the audience laugh . most of the jokes are at the expense of the homophobes in the film , and they are crafted skillfully enough to get the point across--and be funny--without becoming condescending . nevertheless , all is far-from-perfect with okoge . instead of being a cohesive whole , it's more like two films , each very different in quality and tone from the other . the only constant is the characters . the first seventy-five minutes of okoge is a skillfully-done character study , focusing on the unusual menage a trois that exists between sayoko , goh , and tochi . from that moment on , okoge is never the same . the film takes its last twenty minutes to resolve the various messes that the main trio have gotten themselves into . although a little on the sweet side , the ending is nicely-done , showing that love and sex don't have to be two sides to the same coin , but there's nearly forty minutes of confusion between the excellent beginning of okoge and its conclusion . i've never before seen japanese actress misa shimizu , but her performance in this film is an eye-opener . she puts an incredible amount of energy into her performance . i'm not sure how the character was written , but shimizu's rendering of sayoko positively sparkles . the two male leads aren't quite as good , but neither murata nor nakahara does a bad job . okoge may not be an ideal movie , but it goes a long way towards removing the bad taste left behind by such heavy-handed efforts as the living end and claire of the moon . not only does it give an intelligent , sympathetic portrayal of the difficulties of a gay lifestyle , but it presents them from a woman's point-of-view . credit should be given to takehiro nakajima for daring to make this film in a country with such a rigid social structure . the strengths of okoge certainly outweigh the weaknesses .

"in an era when movies are again turning to classic literature for inspiration , it was only a matter of time before a new version of charlotte bronte's jane eyre reached the screen . one of the best-loved of all the victorian novels , jane eyre combines social commentary with gothic romance . this new film , directed by franco zeffirelli ( best known for his 1968 oscar-nominated romeo and juliet ) , remains faithful to the original narrative in general , if not in all the particulars . of necessity , the story has been condensed , since it isn't possible to reproduce a full-length book as a two-hour movie . screenwriters zeffirelli and hugh whitemore have elected to retain jane eyre's full scope while elimiting many of the nuances . the result is a reasonably fast-paced story ( with a confused sense of time ) that occasionally struggles to develop its characters to their maximum potential . ultimately , this film is on par with the 1944 orson welles/joan fontaine version . jane eyre is a love story , but , instead of the lighter romance and humor of jane austen's novels , this tale is marked by stark realism and a pervasive sense of misery . the meticulously accurate settings and beautiful-but-gloomy cinematography establish the atmosphere . even the daytime scenes are drab and colorless , and many of the interior shots are so dark that it's difficult to see the characters' expressions . there's no doubt that one of the reasons jane eyre is so cheerless is because the shadows are often more important than the light . at least in the end , there is a moment of joyful catharsis . with one exception , the acting is excellent . his is a passionless portrayal of a tragic figure . the venerable joan plowright plays mrs . fairfax with grandmotherly goodwill . it's about obligations and taking responsibility for one's actions . and , most of all , it's about the maturation of an unloved girl into a sensitive woman . jane eyre features one of literature's most independent , strong-willed female protagonists in a narrative brimming with repressed emotion and dark secrets . zeffirelli's picture fits nicely into the recent spate of films based on classic novels . it's a vast improvement over last year's hack job of the scarlet letter , but not as impressive as the "" jane austen trio "" ( persuasion , sense and sensibility , and the bbc/a&e pride and prejudice ) . nevertheless , for bronte aficionados , lovers of victorian romance , or those who simply appreciate literate love stories , jane eyre offers two hours of quality entertainment .

"love is supposed to be one of the most wonderful things known to humanity , and hollywood has produced countless pictures that place it on the highest pedestal . but there is another kind of love -- a darker , uglier sort that rarely reaches the screen because the public , it is deemed , finds it too unpleasant . so , while most films are content to explore the lighter , romantic side of love , washington square takes a cold , hard look at the painful , destructive aspect of the same emotion . two years ago , motion pictures enjoyed a flirtation with jane austen , adapting no less than four of her novels into major motion pictures and/or television mini-series . the first , 1949's the heiress ( directed by william wyler and starring olivia de havilland , who won an oscar for her role ) , was based on a stage play version of the book that eliminated many of the more subtle aspects of james' text . the crux of catherine's dilemma isn't whether to surrender money for love -- that would be no choice , since physical pampering is largely unimportant to her . austin could easily have become a black-and-white villain , but finney's performance defies the audience's desire to label him as such . finney handles the complex motivations of his character expertly , creating a fascinating antagonist . the third major character is the most ambiguous . washington square keeps us guessing about morris' real motivations . while ben chaplin's performance is not the equal of leigh's or finney's , he is solid enough not to give away the truth about morris until the script reveals it . lest washington square seem too serious and downbeat , there's always the character of aunt livinia ( maggie smith ) on hand to provide comic relief . austin's sister , who has served as catherine's surrogate mother , delivers many of the film's most witty lines , and her presence single-handedly keeps the tone gentler than one might otherwise expect . the best thing about washington square is that it draws us into the world of the characters and challenges us to understand them and question their views and motivations . the film is emotionally effective without going overboard . director agnieszka holland ( whose previous efforts include europa europa and olivier olivier ) opts to avoid the temptation of reducing washington square to the level of a costume melodrama . her careful , modulated handling of the material makes this resemble merchant-ivory's better work ( like the remains of the day ) . washington square is faithful representation of james' text , and a moving and satisfying portrait of one woman's struggle for independence in a society where everything is defined by love , money , or both .

's style too eclectic for my taste . this is not surprising since his last film was that major bomb , even cowgirls get the blues . nevertheless , i do like to die for . they do a wonderful job of making suzanne into an extremely made up woman in very brief miniskirts and yet they never go over the line and overdo it . the pushed her look to the absolute limit , but never made her look sleazy . to die for runs 1 : 40 , and i think the editors ( jeffrey arsenault and curtiss clayton ) should have left a few more entire scenes on the cutting room floor so that the meantime to laugher was much smaller . the movie is rated r for sex , understated violence , some profanity , and about one second of nudity from a far distance . it is a soft r , and i would see no problem in teenagers seeing the show . there were certainly many in the audience where i was . i give to die for a thumbs up for kidman's performance , for interesting docudrama style cinematography , and for some huge laughs , and i award it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : october 6 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"mpaa rating : not rated ( graphic depictions of corpses , profanity ) running time : 150 minutes . such are the vagaries of critical opinion , that temporal beast , that i found my experience of joe berlinger and bruce sinofsky's documentary both enhanced and diminished by recent pervasive coverage of high-profile murder cases . as a carefully constructed detective story , paradise lost is riveting ; as a study of small town america at its best and its worst , it is compelling . however , as an examination of publicly-aired grief and suspicion of the criminal justice system , it is merely exemplary rather than extraordinary . damien , an occult-fascinated , heavy metal-listening eccentric , is particularly tailor-made for prosecution , but there are potential problems with the case . there also happens to be virtually no physical evidence , and plenty to suggest that the crimes may have occurred somewhere beside the muddy ditch where the bodies were found . the first half hour of paradise lost introduces us to a fascinating cast of characters , and to a setting which is as critical to the case as any piece of evidence . hovering over the proceedings like a dark angel is the film's most enigmatic figure , damien echols -- a perceptive , self-absorbed and vaguely frightening young man who is like a satanist from central casting . the courtroom scenes are rife with the kind of confrontations familiar from both fictional and real-life proceedings , but the knowledge of its reality makes every unexpected revelation all the more enthralling . then new bits of evidence keep exploding like land mines . it is a case of such complexity that any amateur juror who has railed against noteworthy verdicts should be forced to watch paradise lost as a civics lesson . the courtroom drama of paradise lost is certainly intriguing , but i think the film spends a bit too much time in the courtroom , because the actual evidence is only half the story . outrage against the concept of presumed innocence just isn't news in this age , and paradise lost simply underlines this trend rather than exposing it . that is not to diminish its power -- paradise lost will have you asking yourself questions long after it ends . perhaps by the time i reach my own personal verdict , its power will have overwhelmed its familiarity entirely .

""" i'd cry , but my tear ducts haven't worked since my last eye job . "" this is one of the better pieces of dialog in disney's remake of that darn cat , but it , like the rest of the humor in the show , elicits little laughter . the film is so bad that i found myself wishing it had a laugh track . with a laugh track i could at least pretend the movie was funny . i am careful to warn my readers about films . for this one there is a simple admonition : get coffee . unless you imbibe significant amounts of caffeine before entering the theater , you stand a good chance of not being able to stay awake through the many long and dull parts . the original 1965 movie version of that darn cat starred hayley mills and dean jones . it was not the sort of classic film that might suggest that a remake was in order nor did the remake's producer , robert simonds , have any fresh ideas for the project . the film appears to have been made solely for a quick profit . simonds seems to have figured that any disney film featuring a animal had to be a success . the remake is devoid of imagination and creative energy . ricci gives a lifeless performance . perhaps she should have heeded my coffee advice . this part , which was acted by jones in the original , is played for broad humor by doug e . doug in the remake . although i hated doug's performance , i do give him credit for being the only actor to exert any effort . even the cat in the picture is given nothing challenging to do . i have three cats , and all are more emotive than d . c . patti looks the agent sternly in the eye and says , "" you're not a cat person , are you ? "" most of the film relies on sight gags that you have seen a million times before . etc . , ad nauseam . in a typically unfunny scene kelso comes to patti's rescue . "" you smell really bad , "" says patti . director bob spiers , whose previous experience was directing television series , tries to end the show with a bang , but the lengthy chase scene is as repetitive and tiring as the rest of the picture . the show's biggest conundrum is the script . they also did the script for ed wood . both of these scripts are wonderful and highly creative . although i do not understand it , i think there may be a hint in the press kit . every one associated with the film has a lengthy biography except for them . no mention is made of their previous pictures . could it be because they whipped up this screenplay without much thought , and now want to disassociate themselves from the project ? too often critics are too easy on kids' movies . if the pictures are lifeless but harmless , they give them two stars . this version of that darn cat has nothing to challenge minds of any age , and the jokes are pathetic . whereas i do not doubt that many kids will like it , it could and should have been so much better . why shouldn't we aim a bit higher for our youngsters ? intelligent scripts can be both successful and funny , as the one for toy story proved . it is rated pg for some explosions and one mild expletive . it would be fine for most kids although the loud noises might scare some kids under 4 . i give this pitiful excuse for a movie thumbs down and a single * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"the question is whether it was a meaninglessly brief three-second encounter or a more significant full five . a host of studios stand at the ready to deliver the r-rated slasher flicks and the crude sexual humor movies that teenagers flock to in droves . there aren't many studios , however , who still attempt to make a buck off of innocent , pg-rated fare featuring teens . disney is one of the few , and , even if they sometimes come up with harmless duds like i'll be home for christmas , they should be commended for trying . the jokes in the movie are so silly that some of the laughs become almost embarrassing . the most awkward aspect of the movie is the dialog . written at a junior high school level , the setting at a college campus seems inappropriate . the kid locked in his locker routine , for example , isn't something that usually occurs in a college movie . the setup for the road picture is that jake's dad has made a deal with him . the casting of jessica biel as allie is a nice and unexpected touch . she seems much more likely to hang out at the library than the mall . this is a small movie that will probably be long gone way before christmas . one supposes that the marketing department was worried about the crush of all of the movies opening at christmas . even if it is generally lame , the movie is not without its charms . in one nice visual , there is a 5k race open only to people in full santa claus regalia . lose your hat or beard , and you're disqualified . it is rated pg for a few , quite mild profanities and would be fine for the whole family . my son jeffrey , age 9 , thought the film was "" really good "" and gave it * * * ? .

"after a long and highly publicized sojourn in release purgatory , the new version of lolita has finally made it into wide release at the theaters . the immediate question is was it worth all the fuss ? directed by adrian lyne in his usual flashy manner , the film lacks the literary feel and substance of stanley kubrick's 1962 classic starring james mason , shelley winters , sue lyon and peter sellers . jeremy irons with his sad , pensive eyes specializes in playing tragic characters . as humbert humbert , especially in the narration , he puts just the perfectly hopeless spin on the role that lyne wants . irons , who is never less than riveting , rises way above the rest of the presentation . his narrations of vladimir nabokov's rich text from the novel are the film's high points . the major problem with the production is the casting of dominique swain as lolita . her overly "" cute "" mannerisms almost single-handedly sink the picture . one of the least natural of actresses , her acting shows through on every scene and gets in the way of our ever taking the film seriously . the other two principles in the cast , melanie griffith as charlotte haze and frank langella as clare quilty , are perfectly satisfactory but little more . much is made of lolita's innocence . these displays of mock immaturity are directly contradicted by her actions , so few are credible . exquisitely filmed by howard atherton with a lovely gloss , the movie has meticulously constructed period sets . but lyne has little sense of proportion . he flaunts his reconstruction of "" magic finger "" beds and "" tee pee "" motels so often that one might think the movie was a smithsonian documentary . already too long , the film should have had most of these period homages cut . what purpose is served with detailed close-ups of the production of an old-fashioned ice cream float ? the movie ends badly in every sense of the word . do we really need all that gratuitous gore ? please ! it is rated r for aberrant sexuality , violence , nudity and profanity and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are both older and mature .

"it is a small negligence on alice's part not to watch the child for just a few moments , but it has cataclysmic consequences . it tears alice's already miserable life asunder . elliott , who sometimes lets his movie meander , stages the scene of the child's death with particular poignancy . the ending of this scene will literally tear your heart out , and , yet , the way it is presented is completely natural and unmanipulative . no , not about the drowning . this entire episode has chilling parallels with recent , well-publicized cases of massive , false child abuse complaints . weaver , who is in most of the scenes , makes the picture rise above the ordinary . willing to look quite unattractive and to play a remarkably unsympathetic character , she gives a frightening picture of someone on the verge of losing it all in more ways than one . in an otherwise hard hitting film with conspicuous ambiguity , the ending wraps things up a bit too neatly . but after you leave the theater , you'll quickly forget the film's few shortcomings . you'll be thinking instead about weaver's strong performance as a woman on the edge . it is rated r for some sexuality and language and would be fine for most teenagers .

"the cherubic rafael infante , played with charm by popular latin american entertainer chayanne in dance with me , is a klutz when it comes to dancing . in a movie with exactly two "" surprises , "" one is that rafael as actually an extremely accomplished dancer . his problem is that he is not familiar with the more popular dances . the movie begins with the story's second surprise . the movie devotes considerable time to john and rafael's relationship with little payoff in return . the mystery of their relationship doesn't amount to much , and neither does the movie's unsuccessful attempt at poignancy when the secret is revealed . vanessa williams , who plays ruby , is a perfect match for the equally beautiful chayanne , and the sweet chemistry between them feels genuine . these mini-dramas have little appeal and are not the reason to see the film . people come to see the dancing and hear the music . audiences , however , are likely to be disappointed as director randa haines spends an inordinate amount of time off of the dance floor in a film that inexplicably comes in at over two hours in length . why do the characters spend so much time on boat docks and in truck junkyards when they could be dancing ? the costumes are fun , and multicolored lights bathe the dancers . cinematographer fred murphy , regretfully , thinks it is his job to jazz up the picture with tight close-ups of the dancers' backs and sides . this results in a swirl of images that blur into a montage reminiscent of a late monet painting . it becomes difficult to ascertain the skills of the dancers since we are rarely given the proper perspectives . in contrast , rafael leads with his buttocks in a comical but slightly sensual style of dancing that has to be seen to be believed . dance movies should be energetic , not pensive . dance with me comes alive periodically but spends way too much time with low-grade soap opera material . say what you will about the film , its two stars are charming . dance with me runs too long at 2 : 06 . it is rated pg for a brief male topless scene that sent our audience into a chorus of hoots and giggles . the film would be fine for kids around nine and up .

"a superficial but entertaining roller-coaster-ride of nonstop action featuring clich ? characters and contrived dangerous situations , mainly conceived to show off the special effects . the story is so slight that there is no danger of it interfering with the action scenes . it's a hollywood blockbuster for those in need of escaping reality for two hours and should prove to be enjoyable for those who are willing to go with the flow of the action and suspend their critical judgment . the reward will be a visual treat of well-executed stunts and a film that had the glossy look of a national geographic photography shoot . movie viewers could go snowblind just watching a series of mountain catastrophes befall the adventurous climbers , as the film throws out almost any possible danger there is to be found on a mountain and the mountain climbers try to overcome these impossible obstacles and , there is , needlessly to say , a race-against-time sequence , with a last second rescue in the works . the opening eight-minute scene , derivative as it is , is brilliantly done and captures whatever underlying tension the film was to later on build up to . she is still upset with what peter did and could hardly face him , much less talk to him about it . the commercial motive for the climb and the callous way he will soon treat his fellow climbers , makes him the film's designated one-dimensional villain , and adds some more spice to a film that is overspiced already with clich ? s . the rescuers will try to blast the victims out of the cavern , but must be very careful when climbing because with just one spill of the explosive liquid there is the certainty of a tremendous explosion . there will be many tremendous explosions that rock the himalayas , and -- if mountains repeatedly exploding and climbers falling down mountain peaks in colorful ways is your idea of enjoyment , then this is the film for you . the action keeps coming , the clich ? s get resolved somehow , and even though the action sequences couldn't possibly be real , the great photography and beautiful vistas made the locations seem out of this world . the filmmaker used the southern alps in new zealand as his setting , and you could have fooled me , because it sure looked like the himalayas . it also looked like it could be a long commercial for beautiful yuppie adventurers who are shooting an ad for club med , or a national geographic tv special , or even one of those action thrillers that doesn't believe it needs good dialogue to tell its heroic fantasy story .

"sunday , by new screenwriters james lasdun and jonathan nossiter and new director jonathan nossiter , is just the sort of film that gives art house movies a bad name . its plot labyrinth hints at an some undisclosed intellectual reward if you can figure out its message . but , when you finally understand the plot , most viewers will probably feel cheated since the journey is not worth the reward . the writers have surprisingly little to say , and what is said is quite dated and unrealistic . dirty snow dots the terrain like spots on an old pair of trousers . the camera flits from person to person as we catch snippets of meaningless dialog . instead of hearing intelligent writing , we get to see the inside of a filthy toilet bowl and listen as our protagonist urinates into it . although many may find it disquieting to hear suchet speak with an american accent , his accent is quite good , perhaps too good , being so nondescript that he seems to have been born to two television newscasters . his performance in the film can also be argued to be of too high a quality . with him associated with the picture , it is harder to write it off , and it makes one try to find something worthwhile in the story , which is a futile search . the twist is that some of the fantasies will happen later in the movie . this all sounds more engrossing than it is , thanks to the writers' inability to fashion a coherent narrative and create any compelling characters . eventually , in one of the least erotic sex scenes in some time , oliver and madeleine join bodies but little else . later she reflects , "" i don't really know you except in a biblical sense . "" finally -- drum roll -- the film comes to its putative point . given ibm's generous pension and severance pay , one has to assume a lot , proof of the disconnect between the screenwriter's world and the real world . "" you can really fall a long way in this country , "" is how madeleine puts it . "" no work , no hope for work , like every day's sunday , "" explains oliver . with his middle-class background and his talents , he should have no trouble finding employment . the message of this sad and depressing little film is that jobs in america can be quite hard to find -- even for middle-class professionals . it is not rated but would be an r for profanity , sex , nudity , and mature themes . the film would be acceptable for older teenagers . i do not recommend the picture , and i give it * 1/2 only for a fine performance by david suchet in an otherwise dismal film . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"screenplay : richard linklater and kim krizan . director : richard linklater . there , now that i have dutifully trotted out all the terms that are * supposed * to apply to before sunrise , perhaps we can talk about what it really is . that is increasingly difficult to do with relationship-based films about characters in their 20s , which seem to come with generational baggage by the ton , and even harder to do when the director of the film in question is richard ( slacker ) linklater . but leave your pre-conceptions at the door , and you will be rewarded with a nearly perfect romance , a sweet , funny and poignant character study which , if there is any justice , will make julie delpy a star . before sunrise is likely to be a very polarizing kind of film , because it consists almost entirely of conversation between jesse and celine . there is a certain segment of the viewing public which will be driven to distracion by such a structure , and they should do themselves a favor and avoid it . i could argue with these individuals all day , and not convince them to see what i saw in before sunrise : two complex characters developing as genuine a relationship as you could hope to see on the screen . linklater and co-screenwriter kim krizan allow jesse and celine to unfold slowly , so that the characters we think we have figured out early in the film turn out to be something very different by the end . even in isolation , i found getting to know these characters fascinating . together , i found them even more remarkable . ethan hawke and julie delpy both deliver marvelous performances , developing an affection and connection which always seems absolutely real . while both are impressive , it is delpy who commands the camera's attention ; every reaction is on target , and every line seems spontaneous . in that one look , delpy says as much about what this film is about--the risk of romance--than all the dialogue . i keep returning to certain terms when thinking about and describing before sunrise--perfect , genuine , real . if that is so , it is because i have seen film after film over the past few years try to pass itself off as a romance without demonstrating the most cursory understanding about the way a real relationship develops . linklater does so many things right , but i would like to bring attention to things he * doesn't * do . he doesn't wait until the final reel for jesse and celine to kiss , accompanied by a full orchestra ; he doesn't manufacture pointless conflict ; and most astonishingly , he doesn't ever have them say "" i love you . "" before sunrise is about a single night which will become a perfect memory , and i am beginning to believe that is what the film will become for me . ",1
""" mirrors should reflect a little before throwing back images . "" georges auric , cocteau's lifelong musical collaborator , said that he wanted to compose the score for an animated cartoon . cocteau was asked to provide a scenario . this became "" the blood of a poet , "" still one of the most widely viewed of all cocteau's screenworks . there has never been a film quite like le sang d'un poete . cocteau used all his energy and his diverse talents in a medium that was new to him , as this film represented an aesthetic milestone in his career . was it nonsense or serious filmmaking ? in my opinion , a little of both , though the result of the film is a serious work . this 60 minute film is ostensibly , a work on the nature of creating art . special weightless effects were obtained by camera trickery to show the little girl flying up to the ceiling and the poet moving painfully along the corridor wall . once cocteau discovered that he could turn shooting disasters into excellent footage , he was off on a career of making films that carried his trait of creating trick shots : the miraculous mirror and mercury scene in orphee , the live arms holding the candelabra from the walls of la belle et la bete , and the accelerated time sequences of flowers opening in le testament d'orphee are only a few examples of the trick shots he used in his later films . for cocteau , poetry is a coat-of-arms . the film ends with the message : mortal tedium of immortality . in the last frame , an industrial chimney shown in the beginning of the film , finally collapses and all material things are crushed . so much of this film is mysterious and vague , undoubtedly autobiographical in content and motif : cocteau himself always denied the presence of hidden symbolism in the film , but word got about that it had anti-christian undercurrents . this was really not so , according to cocteau , but the false rumor did its damage . it greatly distressed the noailles . the life-line of the movie is its imagery , which can be interpreted many different ways , emphasizing cocteau's view that art disclaimed the world of ordinary appearances and projected vision to be a symbolic representation that must be continually changing , because if it doesn't it will be dead like classicism is and it will cease to exist . the director was afraid that the avant-garde movement would die one day like all other artistic movements have . because of its unusual theme and style and unpredictability , this is a film that deserves the high accolades many film critics have bestowed upon it . it resolutely shows how the filmmaker communicates into the spirit world , and he does so without being pretentious .

"the fundamental requirement of a director is that his actors should never appear to be such . the movie has many an interesting vignette , but never do his actors become flesh-and-blood characters . instead , the actors strut their stuff and show off their craft but nothing more . maybe it's because this play isn't suitable material for a motion picture , or maybe it's because warchus , whose background is as a stage director , doesn't understand the needs of the cinema . whatever the reason , simpatico just limps tediously along until the ending credits put it out of its misery . catherine keener , who can playing working-class types better than just about anyone , is cecilia , a payless store clerk , who is vinnie's girlfriend -- well , kind of . vinnie is such a filthy , no-account that it's hard to see how anyone could tolerate him for more than a few moments . lacking any sustained momentum , the movie just ends . just before the ending , the story interjects a completely predictable , but nevertheless ridiculous , little melodrama . it's the type of pseudo-tragedy that will leave you murmuring to yourself , "" oh , come on !

"citizen ruth has the audacity to skewer both sides of the most controversial issue in america today -- abortion . they figure that the judge's twisted logic of kill the fetus through an abortion or i will try you for abusing the fetus will turn the case into a cause celebre , which it does . laura dern , acting for just union scale wages , gives a brilliant and unflinching performance in a totally unsympathetic role . if you've never seen a spray paint can sniffer in action -- i hadn't -- then you have no idea how gross it can be . the script by first-time screenwriters alexander payne and jim taylor never tries to gloss over her actions or give her some big redemptive scene . her serious role is the fulcrum that supports the rest of the characters , who are drawn so broadly that they become delicious parodies . so , you ask , can they form a compelling story out of this ? the tug of war over the baby in ruth's body becomes the basis of a comedy that works surprisingly well . first-time director alexander payne , one of the co-writers , has a deft sense of how to balance the serious with the comedy and balance the goring of both sides of the political debate . i was at a special screening of the film at which the film's editor kevin tent spoke . he said that although he believes the film does not favor either side , many people with strong views pro or con on abortion believe that it favors their own camp . it just isn't done . other anti-abortion activists are more articulate . diane's unabashed lesbianism does not shock ruth , but how little diane ends up caring for ruth does . both sides call in their big battleships -- their respective national leaders . here reynolds displays some long hidden talent . ) "" . . . keep the chart handy as we figure the capitalization effect on your assets , "" advises larry . to this ruth moans , "" why can't i ever have what i want ?

"a beautiful piece of junk , amounting to a spectacle for the eyes only , as the film itself couldn't justify the violence and human depravity shown . this surreal thriller amounts to a beautifully photographed and stylish film . there is no rational payoff to explain what is happening except this is some pretty sick stuff we are seeing . it's a vile film , that tries to take the film down the same road as coppola's "" the conversation "" and where a number of other morally blurred films about voyeurism had gone , aiming mostly , perhaps , along the lines of brian de palma's suspenseful works . it works into its story devices from a multitude of other films , except this one just didn't add up and seemed to dwell on the grisly violence the woman psychopathic killer commits and offered no valid critical reason to justify all the gore in this beautiful looking but pointless film . lang flatly plays a sympathetic agent in eye's workplace who always appears on a laptop screen . since nothing in this film made sense , why should one expect her role to ! so the film ends as clumsily and distantly as it was throughout . as all we get from this film are some cheap exploitive thrills and a tease that there is some intellectual message hidden in all the mental gymnastics , but what we really have , is a film that failed to get untracked .

"i've gotta admit , i have a real hard time taking adam sandler seriously as a romantic leading man . and apparently i'm not alone in that respect -- sandler himself seems to be having a real hard time taking himself seriously as a romantic leading man throughout the wedding singer . it's surprising and refreshing to watch a performer like sandler try to stretch himself after a string of roles which required him either to scream , destroy things or scream while destroying things . it's also a bit goofy . i was surprised not to find an out-take reel over the closing credits of the wedding singer , since it looked like dozens of takes must have ended with sandler in the middle of a massive giggle fit . it's a good thing that the pleasant but improbable romance doesn't have to carry the wedding singer . the real star of the show is the mid-80s milieu -- a soundtrack full of the era's one-hit wonders pop tunes , thread-perfect costuming by mona may ( clueless ) , knowing references to the eventual breakup of van halen and several famous couples . in fact , the wedding singer is one of the more consistently chuckle-filled comedies of the last several months . though never out-and-out hilarious or inspired , tim herlihy's script ( with uncredited assist from carrie fisher , among others ) gets solid mileage out of its kitschy atmosphere , lively cameos by steve buscemi , jon lovitz and billy idol ( as himself ) , and one priceless moment involving a string quartet's solemn rendition of journey's "" don't stop believin' .

"in the easiest film to enjoy this summer , jenniphr goodman's good-spirited the tao of steve tells the story of a lovable philosopher who attracts women like honey even if he's way too big for his own good . the versatile donal logue ( the patriot ) , who seems to show up in a supporting role in most movies lately , gets a rare starring role this time and makes the most of it . oozing charm from every pore , the sweet dex is a chatterbox philosopher with a purpose -- picking up chicks . being a steve myself , i , of course , know these things , but i'll explain them to you in case you don't . syd , one of the most genuine characters you're likely to see in the cinema , is played by greer goodman with the organic good looks of someone you might meet at a health food store . she has a philosophy too -- "" just say no to nudity .

"nishi , admittedly , has even more on his mind . knowing exactly how to direct himself , he lets the camera linger on his delicate array of expressions . with only minute variations in his facial expressions , he manages to convey a wide range of emotions . a tour de force performance , his work is almost matched by the equally impressive and even subtler piece of acting by kayoko kishimoto as his wife . in a movie with sparse dialog -- easily half of the scenes have none at all -- and an absolutely minimal plot , the masterful camerawork by hideo yamamoto becomes the film's glue . sometimes paying respect to the actors , the camera stops and observes without moving as you would at an art gallery . other times , in the scenes of intense violence , we will have a look so quick that if you blink you may miss it . the overall tone of the picture , thanks especially to jo hisaishi's melancholy music of violins , piano , and flute , is one of serenity in the face of upcoming loss . beneath the characters' almost stoic look burns a caldron of pent-up emotions that seems ready to explode at a moment's notice like an overheated boiler . the poignant tale has us eavesdropping on lives of pain and joy . eventually , it comes to a perfect ending . with the subtlety of the rest of the script , the resolution is not shown , but the staging leaves no doubt . its scant dialog is in japanese with english subtitles . it is not rated but would be an r for brief scenes of strong violence and would be fine for older teenagers .

"latcho drom , which means "" safe journey "" , has no cast and no dialogue . this film , which tells of the migration of the gypsies across europe and asia , presents its story through song and dance . it is an unusual--and ultimately effective--way to tell the tale of an often-neglected people . through the centuries , few groups of people have been as persecuted as the gypsies . christians castigated them as pagans . the carefully-constructed picture of the gypsies could not be clearer , and the brushwork is accomplished without spoken words . director tony gatlif uses images to reinforce the power of his aural message . the most memorable of these occurs when a concentration camp survivor is singing a mournful dirge about auschwitz . we see lonely footsteps in the snow , and the impression is as chilling as the weather . many of the songs are designed to be accompanied by clapping , and the dancers move their hips in a manner that is suggestive and sensual . the most impressive quality of latcho drom is how much history it manages to convey using such an unorthodox manner of story-telling . the film is a sensory banquet of colorful costumes , lively dancers , and emotional songs . there are limits to what can be accomplished exclusively with music and camerawork , however . coupled with a slow ( and , at times , almost-somnolent ) pace , this occasionally makes the movie's greatest asset its most noticeable weakness . on balance , though , those in the picture's small target audience are likely to find latcho drom both appealing and engaging . it is undeniably different .

"mckellar goes for the smaller private moments rather than a grand philosophical argument about the meaning of life or a catastrophic special effect ending . the focus of the film isn't on any sort of biblical apocalypse , nor is it on the outside revellers and looters , or on those who gather in the city square to make it a new year's eve celebration , but it is on those who think out what they want to do and plan to spend a thoughtful evening preparing for the end . the wheeler family uses the catastrophe as an excuse to make this a christmas celebration , believing that even if it isn't christmas that day was the most memorable one for the family and the day of the year they most fondly remember . the sardonic humor and clever performances by sandra oh , don mckellar and callum keith rennie , leave a lasting impression . sandra and don make their experiences seem so vitally human , while callum remains the eternal materialist . the premise is a question that many people have asked themselves , as i recall parties where the game played was to say how you would like to die , and the responses were always so varied and revealing .

"e . j . an unconscionable clinker for those who are more impressed with intellect in films than with special effects , for a film costing 200 million dollars to make , while doing a dutiful job in recreating the grandeur of the ship and its ritzy atmosphere , but failing in everything else , except in the gall to think it has created a masterpiece . if there is anyone out there who stills believes there is such a thing as an unsinkable ship , you'll believe leonardo dicaprio's innocuous portrayal of an artist on board the ill-fated ship and that the soap opera story told is tantamount to a work of art . films backed by big money like this one , rarely ever go after controversy , much preferring to steer a trouble-free course , with a clever eye to the bottom line . i think any actress on board that ship could have played that part . it is hard to believe how trite and contrived this story was , and how everyone in this film had no depth of character . everyone was a wooden stereotype of what their class status was supposed to be like . what gave this film watch ability , was the way the ship was recreated down to its last details , giving one the romantic feeling that one was on the real voyage . at least , the money spent for visual effects went to some good usage . what was ultimately unforeseen , was that the weather created conditions that made it impossible to detect icebergs , which the ship rammed into at full speed . the photography was great . the costumes were terrific . the sound system was as good as it gets . everything about the special effects was first-class . if you judge a film by those standards , then you will be more than pleased with this film . if you are looking for a cruise into deeper water , then i'm afraid you boarded the wrong film , this one will only leak all over you . i waited a long time to see this film , choosing to watch it on tv and not on a big screen theater ; i have no regrets why i waited so long . by the way , i saw a night to remember ( 1958 ) , and thought that version of the titanic to be just grand , not cluttered with a trivial story , just sticking to the suspense of the historical event , which was fine and dandy by my non technical cerebral standards .

"jan hrebejk's divided we fall ( mus ? me si pom ? hat ) , a life is beautiful lite tale , has trouble deciding on its tone . long serious moments are punctuated by whimsical , light-hearted music , suggesting that we should be laughing , although at what isn't apparent . the settings are authentic , but the acting comes across fairly flat . as the credits roll , the movie opens in 1937 in a field in which men are urinating together . this brief scene is aborted in order to skip to another inconsequential episode in 1941 . as the story jumps again to 1943 and the credits are still showing , you being to calculate that the story will end sometime in the twenty-third century . actually , it turns out that the movie is set during the ending of world war ii . the purpose in this bizarre beginning is never quite clear . one supposes that it must have been an attempt at a lightning fast introduction of the characters . the problem with the movie is that too many of the characters seem to have mastered this statuesque lack of expression . the result is a movie that has little impact , save a few nice moments here and there . it is rated pg-13 for some violence and sexual content and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up . just send me a letter with the word "" subscribe "" in the subject line .

""" take me out to the ball game . take me out to the crowd . buy me some peanuts and crackerjack . i don't care if i ever get back so let's root , root , root for the home team . if they don't win , it's a shame . for it's one . . . two . . . three "" you have everything [in baseball]--the immigrants and the rise of the cities , the racial tension , then the decline of cities and the rise of suburbs , the sun belt , conflicts between management and labor , the birth of popular culture and the media , the cult of heroes and celebrity , the nature of democracy itself . to a large extent , to a really astonishing extent , the story of baseball is the story of this country . "" since its inception in the 1700s as "" townball , "" baseball has been a cultural mirror of the society that spawned it . whether in its early years of organization or in recent times , when superstar's salaries have skyrocketed beyond the $5 million mark , baseball has always held wide popular appeal . more than any other sport , baseball is a game of history and memories . its past is its strength , and understanding its current state requires a probing of all that has gone before . ken burns' mammoth baseball has attempted to do just that--examine the game from its beginnings to the modern day . some have erroneously labeled the movie "" exhaustive "" but , in fact , it's far from that . a truly extensive history of the game would take at least ten times the 18-1/2 hours allotted , and would probably be boring beyond belief . the overall structure is cumbersome , and the tone uneven ( inning nine tries to cover too much ; innings three , five , and six drag noticeably ) , but the game/movie parallelism provides as good a way as any to break the production into manageable pieces . it's difficult to believe that anyone , even the most ardent baseball historian , could sit through all one-thousand one-hundred and thirty minutes straight . following a loving introduction extolling the virtues of baseball , burns explores the game's origins , debunking the myth that abner doubleday had anything to do with its genesis . ( "" say it ain't so , joe ! "" ) with so many players off to fight , however , the talent was thin . the mets had the worst initial season of any 20th century baseball team . baseball's most glaring fault is that it's too long . much too long . certain segments seem to drag interminably with little in the way of color added to the basic historical regurgitation . most of what this series has to offer can be gleaned from a good book on the sport . the analysis is rarely penetrating and the visual elements are typically stale . the moments when baseball shines are too often sandwiched around stretches of dry , straightforward documentary presentation . almost equally disappointing is the film's treatment of the modern era . burns' examination of the '70s and '80s is a spotty , hit-and-miss affair that creates few memorable impressions . baseball is at its strongest when it focuses on one of its three primary themes . the film demonstrates the elasticity of the game's appeal , and you get a sense that no matter how immediately crippling the current players' strike is , the sport will eventually overcome it . the examination of baseball's approach to segregation ( before the mid-'40s ) and integration ( thereafter ) is handled in a thought-provoking and thorough manner . burns' probing of the role of blacks in the sport--both in the negro leagues and later in the major leagues--represents one of the most insightful filmed approaches to the subject . inexplicably , however , the work stoppages of the '70s and '80s are not mentioned . fans in other parts of the country may at times feel slighted , however . and boston , other than being burns' favorite team , is hardly worthy of the amount of exposure it receives . based on relative screen time , one would have to conclude that casey stengel was a more important figure than connie mack , and yogi berra was of greater significance than steve carlton , lou brock , and mike schmidt combined . burns' civil war style of combining photographs with "" talking heads , "" period music , and voiceover quotes doesn't work as well in baseball , perhaps because the emotional resonance achieved here doesn't match that of stories of a nation torn by war . by the middle of the series , film clips are replacing still photographs , making this documentary's overall format seem more traditional than that of its predecessor . the are several noteworthy "" recreations "" of partial or entire games . in the end , a non-baseball fan who sticks with this movie for its entirety is likely to learn a lot about the sport and its history , and perhaps gain an understanding of why it inspires such passion in so many people . and every viewer , devotee or not , is herein given the opportunity to appreciate the unique synergy between the progress of the game and american history . baseball is a canvas painted with broad strokes and little detail . burns has invested an incredible amount of effort and passion into a project that is by turns insightful , nostalgic , pedantic , and ( unfortunately ) occasionally dull . "" i actually think [baseball] still is at the center of our lives in this country . oh , it has periods when it seems to be eclipsed . but baseball has so inserted itself into the american soul . its strength is uniting people , generation after generation . it's suffering from an anxiety about itself . and you know what ? knowing your own history is the best antidote to that confusion .

"unlike those who think documentaries exist only in the landscape of serious ideas like the study of famine or repression , michael moore sees the genre in a completely different terrain . he envisions the art form as a way to mix theater of the absurd with standup comedy , and he wraps this all around a serious subject . in his latest movie , the maker of the famous roger & me tackles the issue of corporate downsizing in america . but don't be taken in , this is just a ruse to let moore demonstrate his considerable talent as a comedian . in one of the funnier movies this year , the big one takes an unabashedly one-sided position on a subject that it really cares little about and produces one funny sequence after another . pat buchanan's check , for example , was from abortionists for buchanan . moore's response in the film is to show pictures of the lincoln bedroom and say his problem was that he just didn't donate enough to get any of the perks . this fast-paced documentary veritably pulsates with energy . using music as charged as the film's star and editing it with a deft touch , the movie never flags even if the last half does begin to get repetitious . the show is at its most awkward when moore meets people who have actually been downsized . the bottom line is that , as social commentary , the film is an abysmal failure , but , as comedy , it delivers . ( it also has the misfortune of being released in a time when we have the lowest unemployment rate in several decades , so the tragedy of downsizing is no longer on many newspaper headlines or many people's minds . ) although the jubilant moore tries his best to make him look foolish , knight finds the whole episode hilarious , laughing through almost every minute of it . so where does the title of the movie come from ? in the funniest segment of all , moore discusses how we could better market "" the united states of america . "" he proposes we rename our country , "" the big one , "" since that's how we see our place in the world anyway . he goes on to propose the music , "" we will , we will - rock you , "" as a more powerful national anthem , cutting to a pumped-up crowd singing it while lasers pulsate around them . it is rated pg-13 for some strong language and would be fine for kids around twelve and up .

"fields , i'd rather be in philadelphia . actually , for a movie that's so precise about time ( one of the characters is constantly using a stopwatch ) , the title's a little inaccurate . unless i'm completely confused about when things started and stopped , it's not so much 2 days in the valley as it is about twenty-four hours . what we have here is actually four individual stories that occasionally intersect , often in the most odd and unpredictable of ways . one of the best aspects of 2 days in the valley is the clever manner in which the narrative has been assembled . while things aren't nearly as elaborately-connected as in pulp fiction , i like the way paths cross , characters just miss each other , and everything comes together during the climactic ten minutes . while the plot of 2 days in the valley isn't a masterpiece of intrigue or intricacy , it kept me involved and entertained , and that's about the best you can hope for from this sort of motion picture . fate intercedes , however -- but not just in teddy's life . in one way or another , the wheels of destiny bring nearly all of these characters together , although not always at the same time and in the same place . 2 days in the valley has a penchant for the outrageous , with generous helpings of dark and ironic humor . there are a number of laugh-aloud lines , but the film works best when the comedy is of the "" wink-wink-nudge-nudge "" variety . or , in one of my favorite scenes , dosmo , ever the cordial hostage-taker , offers to cook pasta for his captives . teri hatcher fans will be pleased . most everyone in the cast does a good job , but the standouts are aiello , who is hilarious as the toupeed , down-on-his-luck , dog-fearing hitman , and spader , playing against type , as his emotionless partner . i enjoyed 2 days in the valley . it's pure entertainment -- nothing too serious , nothing too deep -- with an artistic sensibility . it's rare for movies these days to recognize that their audience has an intelligence , and even more unusual for them not to talk down to us . 2 days does both . so , if you're looking for some smart fun , john herzfeld's feature is a worthy choice . and you don't need two days -- just two hours .

"no , he's not talking about the year 2000 software problem . in director john boorman's classic 1972 film , lewis is generally weary of everything electrical and mechanical . before the movie he spoke about its filming , telling us how physically exhausting the shoot was . they made a decision to film all of the river scenes only on overcast days , so they could get just the right threatening look that they wanted . sometimes they had to wait for hours for a little cloud to block out the sun before they could roll the cameras . in addition they used long lenses which magnified the effect of the speed and the action , thus intensifying the drama . this hauntingly tranquil banjo music will reappear periodically during the movie as will scenes of the placid sections of the river . and there will be peaceful shots of roaring campfires and of the river at twilight , all to provide sharp contrast to the horror of their journey . when things first go just slightly wrong , ed suggests that they play golf instead of taking the canoeing vacation -- advice that they will all wish that they had taken . "" i think downstream would be best , don't you ? "" quips lewis . having zsigmond present at the screening made us more conscious than normal about the cinematography . even though we were watching a washed out , old print , the brilliance of his techniques were still easy to recognize . consider just two examples . the viscerally gripping film , which begins with a foreboding peace , ends with a frightening one . all appears well , but it isn't and never will be for the men who survive . it is rated r for intense violence , graphic gore and rape and should be considered nc-17 , a rating that they did not have at the time of the movie's release .

"at other times , the film drifts off into soapy sentimental territory , becoming contrived and not sure if it wants to be that honest and truthful about the bitter-sweet story it is telling . it is a movie made by ealing , a british studio , that actually used mostly a british cast , making the film seem more british than aussie . it is a film that disney could have easily made ; and , it should be noted that this film was made into a successful television sitcom .

"sometimes , a movie just can't live up to its advertising campaign ( or its name , for that matter ) . dumb and dumber is one such case . take the newspaper ad , for example , filled with all those fake , witty quotes . that's rather clever ( although not original ) . unfortunately , the same kind of humorists weren't involved in writing the script . "" dumb "" actually overestimates the film's intelligence . at its best , dumb and dumber is like an ernest movie with a scatological bent . of course , there's as much a place in motion pictures for lowbrow humor as there is for philosophical morality tales , but that assumes the jokes actually work . while i won't claim to have gone through this entire film without laughing , there are some long periods between chuckles . it's frequently like that with flatulence humor--you find it amusing the first time you're exposed to it ( at the age of maybe five or six ) , but it quickly gets tiresome . the thin plot thread upon which dumb and dumber hangs ( not that anyone is seeing this picture for its storyline ) has limo driver lloyd christmas ( jim carrey ) retrieving a briefcase left behind in an airport by a beautiful client ( lauren holly ) . the cross-country trek isn't easy , however . fortunately for lloyd and harry , the bad guys aren't exactly valedictorian material , either . if you appreciate carrey , his first movie , or anything featuring jim varney's cinematic alter-ego , dumb and dumber is likely your sort of experience . everyone else will either be offended , bored , or both . for a movie that , with some reworking , could have come close to an extended monty python-type skit ( and there is a bit about a dead parakeet ) , dumb and dumber ends up aiming a whole lot lower . this is more benny hill territory . then again , that's probably being unkind to the late british gentleman , since he did that kind of humor long before this tiresome screenplay came along . the above represents the opinions of the author , and not necessarily those of bellcore or any organization within bellcore .

"the movie , written and directed by damian harris , is based on david l . lindsey's novel . as the director and one of the film's leads , peta wilson , told us at the screening , both the book and the movie were thoroughly researched . all of this notwithstanding , the story's weakness is that part of it seems too outlandish to be credible . on the other hand , most viewers will not have frequented such palaces of pain and so will have no real idea as to the story's accuracy . vickie explains that sex for her is like putting your head in the mouth of the most vicious lion at the zoo . a mixture of sex , secrecy and seduction runs through the film as does the commonality of child abuse as an underlying cause of many of the characters' actions . scenes move with a deliberate slowness , accentuated by mesmerizing music and handsome cinematography . sometimes the editor switches to a slightly slowed motion to further enhance the mood . the intriguing film is at its best when it sticks to its roots as a crime drama with the investigation parts being the picture's highlights . the sexuality works at times , but too often dissolves into a kind of psychobabble . in a film without a lot of laughs and one in which the s&m world frequently looks too glamorous , catherine's second in command , lt . fritch ( beau starr ) , pokes fun at it all .

"producers : bernd eichinger and martin moskowicz . director : bille august . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , sexual situations ) running time : 119 minutes . before smilla's sense of snow , the last time director bille august gut hold of a mysterious , best-selling novel was 1994's the house of the spirits . if that thought doesn't send a shudder of dread through you at the prospects for smilla , you were probably fortunate enough to miss the house of the spirits . spirits was a disastrous combination of mis-guided casting and even more mis-guided story-telling , and it lost all sense of isabel allende's magical realism . peter hoeg's _froken smillas fornemmelse for sne_ ( miss smillas' feeling for snow ) presented a similarly challenging combination of atmosphere , character and plot , and august , but this time around he has been much more faithful to the source material . unfortunately , the result still isn't a particularly good film . as tense and evocative as smilla's sense of snow is during its first hour , it shares the fundamental flaw of the novel : a strange plot device which may leave you wondering if you've just seen "" the x-files "" movie . you'd never expect a film with the plot i just described based on the first scene in smilla's sense of snow . the moment is spectacular , but when the scene suddenly shifts to modern copenhagen and the film becomes a dark , moody mystery , you might wonder whether you've just had an out-of-genre experience . more to the point , you might fear that august has snapped his cap . actually , august is simply preparing the audience for the radical shift still to come , a shift which wasn't nearly as radical in hoeg's novel . for about three-quarters of its length , smilla's sense of snow is a fairly compelling character study anchored by a strong lead performance . julia ormond may be a bit young for hoeg's smilla , but she makes the character her own with an unapologetic toughness uncommon in female screen characters . screenwriter ann biderman has done a fine job of paring down the novel's often-cumbersome plot and its glut of conspirators , allowing the focus to stay squarely on smilla and her relationships . ormond's performance and august's direction capture hoeg's lyrical , haunting psychological drama , a style reminiscent of _the english patient_ author michael ondaatje . but then there's that third act , and there's nothing august , biderman or anyone else can do about smilla's sense of snow's unexpected metamorphosis from michael ondaatje to michael crichton except take it all the way overboard . the greenland-based climax includes some splendid landscapes by cinematographer jorgen persson , and the arctic vastness suggests the coming of a resolution with an internal dimension -- smilla coming to terms with her life , her land and her heritage . the finale is so utterly bizarre -- and so unsatisfying -- that it taints the entire two hour experience of smilla's sense of snow .

"a movie as a star vehicle is an honored tradition . so in 1967 when still fairly new director franco zeffirelli wanted to make his first big hollywood picture , he cast both richard burton and elizabeth taylor . the film was the taming of the shrew and with superstars like that how could he miss . the acting was sure to be good , and the press would cover every antic on the set thus building up the excitement for its release . the quality of the result is debatable , but one thing is certain , burton and taylor clearly have great fun with their acting assignments . the audience at the six weeks shakespeare festival at san jose's camera three seemed to be having a good time as well . in my judgment shakespearean comedies work best when the directors rely on the words for the humor . this is the path that kenneth branagh chose for much ado about nothing . zeffirelli opted instead for slapstick figuring that the play needed to be jazzed up with many sight gags and general physical comedy . moreover , although the words sound authentic , screenwriters suso cecchi d'amico , paul dehn , and franco zeffirelli seem to have modified a fair amount of the bard's text . i must admit that whenever i see the writing of a movie is done by a committee i take that as a bad omen . the picture is filmed by oswald morris ( academy award winner for fiddler on the roof ) and luciano trasatti in a hazy glow as if through a slightly rose tinted lens . to complement this rosy glow , the academy award nominated sets by john decuir , giuseppe mariani , lorenzo mongiardino , and elven webb look like a disney prototype for a renaissanceland . since zeffirelli viewed the play as a romp , these images help establish the spirit of the film . the story is typical for shakespeare -- full of false identities where people are not who they seem to be . taylor spends most of the first part of the film grunting and throwing things . although by the end the slapstick does subside , we have to endure flying tables of dust and other acts i found lacking in much real humor . zeffirelli also had many filthy servants with bad teeth in his attempt to provide increased mirth . sadly that was not as often as it should have been . taylor is a famous yo-yo dieter , but she was just the right size when the movie was filmed -- certainly not svelte but trim and with an overflowing bosom shown to advantage in the clothes of the period . burton too looks the part of a crude but cunning man . petruchio complains that it is , "" nothing but sit and sit , and eat and eat ! "" for the record , my all time favorite shakespeare movie is zeffirelli's romeo and juliet where he plays it straight . not a bad movie , but there is more potential lost than realized . i enjoyed it enough , but i would not want to see it again . the show appears not to be rated , but it would be a pg for some of the bawdy references . there is no sex , nudity , violence , or modern profanity . the show would be fine for kids of any age , but they would probably have to be at least nine to be interested in it . i give the show thumbs up and award it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"screenplay : scott rosenberg . producers : jerry bruckheimer and mike stenson . director : dominic sena . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence , adult themes , brief nudity ) running time : 119 minutes . in an ever-changing world , there's something understandably comforting about the impressive sameness of jerry bruckheimer productions . there's a formula to his films that has rarely let him down , a formula that continues with nary a whiff of change in gone in sixty seconds . since this is a bruckheimer film , you know you can count on . . . 1 ) a premise ready-made for action . 2 ) a style that transcends individual directors . it doesn't matter whether bruckheimer's flavor of the month is tony scott , michael bay , simon west or sixty seconds' helmer dominic sena -- his films all seem to look and sound exactly the same . perhaps it's the fact that bruckheimer is attracted to directors whose background ( like his ) is in commercials and music videos , making them likely to concur with his vision of glossy packaging . maybe he gets his people such great deals on orange lens filters that it's impossible for those directors not to employ them for every single shot . whatever the reason , the quick-cuts , bombastic musical scoring and burnished glow give bruckheimer films that certain grandiose flash that makes for action gold , even if nothing else makes much sense because of in his recent efforts , bruckheimer has shown a distinct inability to strip down an action story to its essentials . gone in sixty seconds is no exception , dragging the pacing down by cramming too many characters into the narrative . that can result in absurd decisions like creating a solid , vicious villain in eccleston , then having his character disappear for literally 80 minutes of the running time , or similarly wasting the forceful presence of vinnie jones ( as memphis' mute , muscular associate ) . it also results in conflicts constructed with a faux-operatic sense of consequence . the family tension between memphis and kip , the non-sparks between memphis and his old flame/running partner sway ( angelina jolie ) , even the history between memphis and lindo's determined detective bog the film down with a ridiculous sense that the story should be taken seriously , when it should be a quick and dirty piece of crowd-pleasing nonsense . those decisions are complicated , for better and worse , by . . . 4 ) provocative casting . cage and duvall are both back for gone in sixty seconds , as is the characteristically diverse bruckheimer supporting cast . somehow , it does make many of bruckheimer's films feel less awful than they should that there are fairly talented actors involved ( cage's descent into genre nonchalance notwithstanding ) . it also seems even more pathetic when they are stuck with scott rosenberg dialogue like "" he's bad he's real bad . "" or , "" i'm not into the life any more . "" of course , plenty of viewers will still lap it all up because it all comes coated in . . . eventually , bruckheimer films do move , albeit with a carefully constructed familiarity . the climactic car chase in sixty seconds is a competent piece of film work , accentuated by sena's fetishistic cross-cutting to brakes and clutches , and a car jump as aggressively improbable as anything since speed . it's simply obvious that the whole film was constructed around that chase , making me wish the film-makers could be more honest about their intentions instead of lobbing a dozen pointless sub-plots at us . those who have enjoyed most of bruckheimer's previous films aren't likely to look disdainfully at this one , because it goes nowhere different . it's just another over-blown , sporadically diverting celebration of guy stuff . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"renny harlin , whose previous directorial efforts include die hard 2 and cliffhanger , seems fond of big , explosive action pictures . unfortunately , excepting his debut ( the middle film in the die hard trilogy ) , plot coherency hasn't been a particularly important attribute of his movies . cliffhanger was little more than a series of spectacular stunts linked together by a paper-thin story . if anything , the strands of logic in cutthroat island are even thinner . fortunately , as a spectacle for the eye and ear , this high seas adventure is more than capable of capturing its audience's attention . holding it for more than two hours is a different matter altogether . . . however , while the special effects and explosions here far outstrip hollywood's early pirate movies , storyline , characterization , and acting are vastly inferior . thus , while cutthroat island may have cost $70 million to produce , it's still a pale shadow of its predecessors . the "" twist "" here , as already mentioned , is that the hero is a female . modine has absolutely no chemistry with co-star davis , and watching these two together is about as exciting as sitting through those dumb slideshow commercials that precede movies in many theaters . cutthroat island is more entertaining for its dumb storyline and overt silliness than for its nearly nonstop action . technology plays its part in what the film has to offer , as well . sound editing is excellent and the score ( written by john debney and performed by the london symphony orchestra ) is suitably rousing . cutthroat island is a mindless diversion . if , for whatever reason , you decide to go , maintain low expectations . hoping for more than a bunch of loud bangs and ridiculous dialogue will rob cutthroat island of its amusement value .

"screenplay : steve martin . director : gillies mackinnon . his script for roxanne retained only the most basic plot elements , while ditching the tragedy . with a simple twist of fate , he has been perhaps too faithful , letting a deliberate exposition and somber tone dull a potentially appealing redemption tale . there is something jarring about watching a film constructed like a 19th century novel set in the present day . a simple twist of fate takes its own sweet time establishing its plot and characters , and for the first half hour it seems muted to the point of inaudibility , and very dark in its tone . but curiously , the one thing missing from this overlong first act is any sense of who michael mccann really is . he is viewed mostly through the reactions of townspeople , or filmed in shadow hoarding his precious gold coins . i felt that i knew more about characters like newland's wayward brother ( stephen baldwin ) than the man whose transformation is to provide the centerpiece for the film . to be fair to steve martin the screenwriter , steve martin the actor may not have been the best choice for this role . for the past couple of years , in such films as leap of faith , martin has been trying to establish himself as a legitimate dramatic actor , and while he is always an appealing presence , he just doesn't look comfortable in scenes which require serious emotion . his standard "" repressed emotion "" take is on frequent display in a simple twist of fate , and it usually just makes him look slightly constipated . at those moments , i just couldn't lose myself in the pre-mathilda mccann . there is much more to enjoy in the second act of simple twist . martin is very good as the nervous novice father , and his scenes with the various child actors playing mathilda are generally quite charming . also appealing are the performances of catherine o'hara as a quirky antique shop owner who befriends mccann ( and , in a pleasant surprise , * doesn't * become his romantic interest ) , and gabriel byrne , slipping in and out of a virginia accent but providing some nice shading for a part that could have been a stock villain . unfortunately , the conclusion of a simple twist of fate becomes a predictable and overlong custody battle , complete with courtroom scenes and a hissable lawyer . the more melodramatic a simple twist of fate became--and ironically , the more like its source material-- the less effective it was as a film . as nicely as the bonding between father and daughter was portrayed , it couldn't compensate for the plodding story on either end of it .

"" the film revels in self-congratulatory outrage , leaving its characters to founder undeveloped . j . t . walsh plays happy , the fat-cat athletic booster , as an absurd stereotype , and mary mcdonnell plays bell's ex-wife as a recycled version of her spirited ex from sneakers . there is the potential for an interesting conflict when o'neal's bodeaux exhibits a reluctance to buy in to the same ethic as his teammates , but shelton and director william friedkin seem reluctant to give any of the novice actor-athletes too much to say . they also seem unwilling to ask any of the hard questions about collegiate athletes , such as whether or not they actually deserve some sort of compensation . every choice is the obvious one and the wrong one , right down to an awful "" conscience "" voiceover during the climactic game . blue chips could have saved itself by getting its basketball right , but there are a basket full of problems there as well . the on-court action is fairly bland , and photographed from all the wrong angles . friedkin makes no particular effort to make the setting seem collegiate , with crowd shots focusing on politely cheering alumni . however , two gaffes particularly irked me . in the first game , with the margin twenty points in the last minute , every seat in the stand was still filled ; i suppose it would have been tricky telling half the crowd to leave when rumor has it that tickets for the filming were being scalped for $100 . then , in the final game , the crowd reaction comes far too slowly given the result , and doesn't seem remotely authentic . it's too bad shelton couldn't have brought the same feel to the hardwood that he brought to bull durham's dugout . there are a few things to like about blue chips . nolte is perfectly cast as a coach , and o'neal and hardaway are pleasant surprises . blue chips' puffed-up indignance wears thin quickly .

"starring : elijah wood , kevin costner , mare winningham , lexi randall . screenplay : kathy mcworter . director : jon avnet . if they gave out academy awards for earnestness , the war would have to be one of the front-runners . war , it solemnly intones , is bad ; so are racism and sexism . as a result , some very impressive performances are wasted on a script that just tries far too hard to deliver a very simplistic moral . the problem is that it's in too many places . it's not even enough that elvadine gets to tell off the teacher in a completely over-the-top speech ; lidia has to get her two cents in as well . mcworter appears convinced that wherever one speech is good , two must be even better . the script is overloaded with homilies , and needed a good re-write at least fifteen minutes shorter . one of the goals of that re-write should have been removing the characters of lidia and her friends entirely . the relationship between the simmons siblings is given only a cursory treatment , and the narration lidia provides could just as easily have been provided by stu , or not at all . the war is first and foremost about the relationship between stu and stephen , and there are too many tangents which ignore that relationship . when costner and wood are the focus of attention , the war is actually quite compelling . there is tremendous conflict in their relationship , and both actors do a fine job of bringing it out . sadly , mcworter and director jon avnet are more interested in heavy-handedness than they are in character study , so that by the time the climactic battle for the treehouse rolls around , the point has been made and made and made again . now let me get this straight : war is bad , right ?

"a few months ago , i was at a press screening for another touchstone film which was preceded by a teaser trailer for mission to mars . as the trailer unfolded , the critics in the audience began to snicker with increasing frequency . the imagery used was startling similar to images from 2001 : a space odyssey -- an astronaut in a white room , an approach to a dark object in the distance , a figure spinning off into space . it was comical not just because of the familiarity , but because it seemed so quintessentially brian de palma . the train station sequence in the untouchables came from eisenstein's potemkin ; the single-take opening sequence in snake eyes felt like welles' touch of evil ; whole heaping chunks of his early films appropriated hitchcockian devices and themes . so why wouldn't de palma take on the most iconic science-fiction film ever made while making his first science-fiction film ? why not add kubrick to his list of victims of auteur homage ? it's more alarming that it's similar to the cookie-cutter hollywood approach to any story . the frustrating thing about any brian de palma film is that you can always count on at least one extended sequence where you realize what a brilliant technical craftsman he can be . a chain reaction of events following that accident keeps building tension , leading to some genuinely tense moments . de palma's sense for timing this sort of sequence is impeccable -- recall the editing of tom cruise's computer room break-in in mission : impossible -- leading to the hope that mission to mars can maintain that sort of visual and emotional energy . and then you remember this is brian de palma . every once in a while , by sheer twisted accident , de palma ends up working with a rich , smart script -- the untouchables , blow out , carlito's way . more often , you get the impression that he looks for a script with a few places he can show off his visual flair . mission to mars has its showcase sequence , but it also has a leaden script full of plug-and-play characterizations . it's the sort of mawkish back-story screenwriters use all the time in adventure films , in a token -- and usually futile -- attempt to show that the people matter more than the concept . ironically , mission to mars is that rare case where the concept does matter more than the people . when mission to mars gets metaphysical , it makes sure there's someone on hand to narrate every brutally obvious revelation , and someone whose individual journey to wholeness will be completed by this close encounter . this film doesn't end with the awe of creation ; it ends with tedious exposition topped off by an interplanetary clasping of hands . there are flashes of brian de palma the visceral thrill-master in mission to mars , but he doesn't seem to know what to do with its limp conclusion . this time around , it probably would have been a good idea . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"you say . let me say upfront that for whatever reason , probably thanks to director kevin lima ( tarzan ) , 102 dalmatians is much better than it's immediate predecessor , 101 dalmatians .

( there were several blood curdling screams from little tykes in our audience when it looked like oddball was going to be a goner . ) an unusual dog , he has colorful feathers and a beak , although he doesn't think he can fly . giving a single animal the ability of speech makes the story funny without being too silly . sometimes the simplest scenes of the dogs wagging their tails are so cute that you can't help but break into a big smile . and the sets and the costumes alone can provoke quite a few laughs . depardieu doesn't have much of a part , but he makes the most of it . always pronouncing puppies as "" poopies , "" he sounds like he just walked off the rugrats set . 102 dalmatians is first and foremost a movie ripe with physical comedy . the dialog is treated as almost an afterthought . so what video would a bunch of dogs want to watch when their master is on a date ? in one of the story's best sequences , the movie cuts between the video and kevin and chloe enjoying spaghetti just like lady and the tramp . on the whole , however , 102 dalmatians is a good spirited movie that rarely disappoints . it is rated g , but the "" poopie "" endangerment scenes may scare some kids under 5 . my son jeffrey , age 11 , gave the film * * * . he really liked oddball and waddlesworth , but complained that he missed the dogs from the first movie . maxim , age 12 , went wild over the picture and gave it * * * * . nickolas , age 11 , gave it * * * 1/2 , having similar comments to jeffrey's . eliot , age 11 , on the other hand , hated the movie , giving it just * 1/2 . he complained that it wasn't original and that it didn't link properly to the first film . the votes from the rest of jeffrey's 6th grade class were quite positive although there were a few who didn't like it .

"it's a curious thing that the best 1995 adaptation of a jane austen book happens to be of her worst novel . sense and sensibility was the author's first published work and , as is often the case with early writing efforts , displays an undeniable shallowness : themes are half- developed , characterization is uneven , and plotting follows a predictable straight-forwardness . austen's later books , including persuasion , which was developed into a wonderfully sumptuous film earlier this year , and emma , which received unusual treatment in clueless , plumb the human soul far more deeply , creating characters and situations of greater versatility and vitality . that's more in the nature of literary criticism than a film review , however . sense and sensibility is a wonderful motion picture , even given the weaknesses of the source material . emma thompson's screenplay has remained faithful to the events and spirit of the book , while somehow managing to plug a few holes and infuse the tale with more light humor than is evident in austen's original text . the resulting product is a little too long ( one-hundred thirty-five minutes ) , but still represents a fine time at the movies , especially for those with a bent towards historical romantic melodramas . as mentioned above , the story isn't all that complex or surprising , and those unfamiliar with austen's work won't be left in the dark . the story of who ends up with whom , and how they get that way , is told with deft skill and a pleasantly humorous romantic touch . as is so often the case in british productions , acting is more important than the script or the impressive production values . emma thompson's elinor can join the actresses' characters from howards end , the remains of the day , and this year's carrington as examples of top- notch , finely-nuanced performances . winslet isn't as accomplished as thompson at capturing the camera's attention , but rarely is she completely eclipsed , either . as expected , the supporting cast is excellent . hugh grant brings his usual boyish charm to edward , and alan rickman ( die hard ) , too often pigeonholed into villainous roles , shows for the first time since truly , madly , deeply that he's very much at home in a romantic part . the novel's flaws guarantee that sense and sensibility cannot be a perfect motion picture , but it would be difficult , i think , to do much better with the material than emma thompson and director ang lee ( eat drink man woman ) have here . with more jane austen on the way ( versions of pride and prejudice and emma ) , it's still too early to say which adaptation will stand out as the best , but sense and sensibility makes a strong case .

"there's something terribly depressing about a wonderful concept turned into mush by someone who doesn't know how to handle it . the irritations of a film like the replacements are far more mundane by comparison-you know that it will be at best a tolerable audience-friendly mediocrity , at worst a bland , pressed and processed entertainment mcnugget . but i'm a cheerleader , on the other hand , could have been a brilliant bit of satire . it could have been the kind of film that , even while preaching to the choir , highlights the magnificent absurdities of a very hot-button issue . could've been , but isn't . there's something in that idea to anger virtually anyone , only babbit doesn't pursue it . even the good gags babbit wrings from this variation -- like the photo in megan's school locker -- are underlined too obviously , and never reach into truly daring areas . the campy tone set in the first half-hour , including moriarty's drag diva performance , show that babbit isn't particularly interested in scathing humor . simple mockery suits her just fine . even that tone , however , proves to be one she can't sustain . but i'm a cheerleader might never have been riotously funny as the silly spoof it initially appears to be , but at least it might have felt consistent . babbit makes the ridiculous decision to bounce back and forth between scoring points off swishy stereotypes , exploring the conflicts of family reaction to homosexuality and developing an actual romantic sub-plot . there's not nearly enough substance to but i'm a cheerleader for its serious side to feel anything but token , and too many misguided serious moments to give it a real comic kick . and you can feel that potential being crushed under babbit's leaden heel every time megan and graham share a tender moment . there are plenty of people who take the idea of converting gays and lesbians to heterosexuality very seriously , and plenty of people with same-sex attractions who desperately want such programs to work . babbit never seems to clue into that fact , or she would base her satire more squarely in the growing popularity of these programs . instead , she lays out but i'm a cheerleader as though the whole idea were self-evidently ludicrous , and gets lazy about finding the humor in people scrambling for conformity , acceptance and easy answers to a challenging issue . but i'm a cheerleader simply isn't funny enough often enough , and that's the kiss of death for a low-budget comedy full of broad performances and careless story-telling ( what happened to the foreshadowing involving another girl's apparent jealousy of megan and graham's relationship ? ) . there's no excuse for a subject this incendiary to be the stuff of pratfalls and sappy endings . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

""" it's my considered opinion that in the fullness of time , history will record the greatness of [michael] collins and it will be recorded at my expense . "" not unexpectedly , writer/director neil jordan has been obligated to affirm the picture's integrity , stating at the toronto film festival that "" most of the people who accuse me of inflaming the peace process have no interest in the peace process whatsoever . "" in truth , while michael collins does distort elements of history , most of the changes and compressions are dramatically effective . certain characters are combined , a few deaths happen differently from what history records , and events have been streamlined . the usage of such "" dramatic license "" is not uncommon in the development of reality- based movies , so it shouldn't come as a surprise that it exists in this case . perhaps the most suspect element of michael collins' script is the negative portrayal of irish hero eamon de valera . partisans of the late president will not react favorably to such speculation , even though , in the context of this narrative , it works . putting aside all the controversy , however , viewers are left with an expertly-directed and well-acted historical epic that disappoints only in its shallow perspective of the irish/british and irish/irish conflicts . this is a case where the era not only defines the character , but the character defines the era . it's impossible to tell the tale of michael collins without delving into the beginnings of the ira and the dramatic upsurge in support for sinn fein , yet there's a sense that important issues have been glossed over . however , jordan's view of characters and circumstances is remarkably even-handed -- he shows both the brutality and sensitivity of collins' nature , turning the man into the central figure of an almost-shakespearean tragedy . strong acting is a key reason why michael collins is as effective as it is . his portrayal of collins is the most passionate , powerful work he has ever done , easily eclipsing his oscar-nominated presentation of oscar schindler . for well over a decade , neeson has been carefully honing his talents , and the results are apparent here . although neeson's forceful performance drives the movie , he is assisted by an able supporting cast . alan rickman , best known for playing flamboyant villains ( die hard and kevin costner's robin hood ) gives a surprisingly low-key and introspective interpretation of de valera . and , despite a variable irish accent , julia roberts is more than capable in the small role of kitty kiernan , the woman who brings collins' human side to the fore . even for those who know the whole story of michael collins , the movie is still a riveting piece of film making , capable of holding an audience's attention for more than two hours . jordan not only does an exceptional job recreating the ireland of the 1920s , but presents us with an entirely human protagonist who's flawed yet sympathetic . collins is not the brash hero of the traditional historical epic -- he's a tormented individual who knows that his chief talent is for creating mayhem , but who wants peace so desperately that he's willing to die for it . leeson's portrayal of collins' agony during the civil war is so real that , at times , it's almost painful to watch . in tone and spirit , if not in time and place , this film shares a great deal with last year's oscar-winning braveheart . neil jordan felt that this story was so important that he nurtured the script for thirteen years until he had the clout to command the actors and budget he wanted . the ultimate result may not quite match his ambitions , but it will still be one of 1996's most talked- about motion pictures . -- ingmar bergman ",1

"set in a stoned-out 1971 , the movie's central character , raoul , and his sidekick and attorney , dr . gonzo , spend the entire picture ripped , stoned , plastered , wasted , you name it . mainly they are going so they can party using every illegal substance you've ever heard of and some you haven't . as directed by the wildly imaginative terry gilliam from monty python and the holy grail , brazil , the fisher king and twelve monkeys , the comedy starts off so ridiculously that you can expect many people to walk out in disgust . to his credit , depp takes what starts as an almost unwatchably bad movie and manages to make it kind of fascinating . with arms waving at imagined terrors , with feet and legs wobbling so he can barely walk without falling , and with a voice that sounds like it's coming from the bottom of a well , he looks so convincingly drugged out of his mind that you'll want to help him into treatment . depp's performance is so over the top and mesmerizing that he manages to make you care about a highly unsympathetic character . benicio del toro takes a more by the numbers approach to the part of dr . gonzo . he mumbles so many of his lines that he makes his character believable but rarely interesting . a host of actors appear in cameo roles . in one of the film's best scenes , raoul's drugged brain morphs a bar of conventioneers into a group of alien monsters like those in the bar scene in star wars . the special effects in the movie are inventive and the psychedelic colors of the sets by the crow's alex mcdowell are eye-catching . and when the movie gets utterly absurd , as it frequently does , at least the audience is entertained by some great music of the late 60s and early 70s .

"another film skewed for tarantino enthusiasts , and this one is just as conversationally maddening , filled with vulgarities and street talk , but no sex . it pays to be the first one on your block to do it , because imitation is always second-hand stuff , and this film has the feel of something already done by many other copy-cats . but it was a funny movie , in a perverted way , even if the story line just didn't add up . when you hear the reason why they did this , you'll know for sure that this film doesn't make sense . this is peter o'fallon's feature film debut , as he chugs out all the slickness he could muster to make this film seem like its happening , including glittering credits that seem to be dancing on the screen . but it also could refer to the ill-advised nature of the mission the boys are on , because what they are doing is surely suicidal . his encounter with the dopey kidnappers of lisa , shows how he goes about his business , pulling the film into the gangster genre for a few minutes before going back to its satire of that genre . this is done while the boys are playing poker , and it passes for about as much wisdom as you are going to take away from this well-acted , dark comedy/suspense film , that is absolutely ridiculous , but it is entertaining as escapist-fare . there is one more priceless pearl of wisdom dished out , that i feel should be mentioned , because it highlights the confusing messages the film sends out , it was also uttered by charlie during his confinement , and for no particular reason it made me laugh aloud-- "" everybody lies : but word on the street , that's solid .

"" the connection between kevin costner's butch and t . j . lowther's phillip isn't something nebulous , but a father-and-son-like relationship that profoundly affects both of them . once they're together , neither of them can be the same--not spiritually , physically , or morally . this relationship is the centerpiece of a perfect world , and director clint eastwood allows it to play out at the leisurely pace necessary for it to achieve its ultimate depth and power . there are a few brief action scenes punctuating the drama , but this is not a movie for the viewer who craves car chases and shootouts . on the surface , the scenes featuring eastwood appear largely superfluous and , while they aren't strictly necessary to the plot , they nevertheless serve an important purpose . a perfect world wouldn't be best served by presenting the butch/phillip sequences without interruption . the pacing would be too slow ; the tone too somber . the inclusion of a storyline focusing on butch's pursuers allows for a few more characters , an opportunity or two of comic relief , and a subplot that ties a few things together a little too neatly . like his star , kevin costner , clint eastwood is a better director than actor . eastwood the actor has two modes--the cynical tough guy and the sensitive tough guy , both of which are on display here ( the former more often than the latter ) . he's in fine form , but it's his behind-the-scenes work that really deserves the credit . a perfect world has its moments of manipulation , but they are masterfully subtle . with films like the joy luck club , we feel the strings being tugged ; such is not the case with this movie . kevin costner is an unusual actor--his performances are as inconstant as his choices of films . for every dances with wolves , there's a the bodyguard . perhaps eastwood deserves a share of the credit , but costner develops a credible character who comes across as both believable and sympathetic despite his obvious criminal nature . the portrayal eclipses the portrayer , which is always a good sign . laura dern is wasted . i can only assume her inclusion is an attempt to present a strong-willed , intelligent woman as a foil for clint eastwood , but her ability is rarely shown and never developed . ms . dern does a surprisingly good job with what little material she has , but her presence isn't necessary , and it adds little . a perfect world is evidence that hollywood is still capable of producing the kinds of moving , intelligent movies that many people today believe to be solely the province of independent film makers . this picture is good enough to stand with the piano and the remains of the day , rightfully claiming to offer as much as they do . the characters here have depth and breadth , and the themes and relationships are as complex as in any of the year's best offerings . clint eastwood won an oscar for directing unforgiven , and a perfect world shows that the wellspring of talent is still bubbling energetically . may it never run dry .

"all right , i'm not saying people flocked to white men can't jump or indecent proposal thanks to his name above the title . nevertheless , harrelson has demonstrated an enviable talent for picking hits , even if that has been the only thing he has really demonstrated in his fledgling big screen career . the cowboy way is in for a much harder ride towards success , facing stiff summer competition , but whatever its box office take , there might be more in it for harrelson to be proud of personally than any of his previous films . given the challenge of carrying a film for the first time , he takes a tedious formula picture and singlehandedly makes it at least moderately endearing . i could easily name fifty variations on this particular theme which have graced the screen since i have been a regular movie-goer ; fish-out-of-water comedy is as venerable a genre as the western itself . the cowboy way fits every one perfectly creating that comfortable familiarity filmmakers seek much more frequently than originality . the tweaks to that formula the cowboy way incorporates run from the obvious ( the friendly cop has a romance with cowboy mythology ) to the mildly interesting ( dylan mcdermott's insecure villain ) , but let's be frank . the cowboy way does not , nor was it meant to , dazzle with its inventiveness . in fact , there are long stretches when it's a crashing bore . the showpiece here is the energetic performance of woody harrelson , who has a great deal of fun with the lovably oafish pepper . in many ways , the cowboy way plays like little more than a series of setups for pepper to do something stupid , which could have been a nightmare if so many of those stupid things weren't so funny . as long as harrelson was on the screen , the cowboy way kept me smiling . if only there was one interesting person for him to interact with . kiefer sutherland continues to show that screen presence is a recessive sutherland family trait , reading every line as though he had something on the stove that he really needed to get back to . sonny is supposed to be level-headed , but sutherland interprets "" level-headed "" as "" comatose , "" much as he did in last year's the three musketeers . the cowboy way is a tired premise filled with tired-looking actors , but woody harrelson was able to lasso me by the neck and take me along for the ride . i'd like to see a home video version where the plot is edited out entirely ; it just ends up getting in harrelson's way .

"after a brilliant , stylish opening sequence , this film begins to unravel and by the time it ends , it is a misfire . cage and sinise play well off each other : sinise reserved ( just right for the part ) , cage frenetic ( over - emoting but still very effective ) . assassination taking place in the crowded boxing venue is masterfully done , and well worth the price of admission , as de palma goes crazy with his cameras offering numerous shots from all different angles of the crowd and the casino . we soon learn who the villains are , so the picture that so brilliantly set - up an interesting set of conflicts between the characters such as : loyalty , corruption , sense of duty , patriotism , and one's own personal dilemmas begins to go off in another direction , in the direction of where the film - makers think it can draw in the box office crowds , that is , it turns into a flat action movie , where things are easily predictable and we are cut off from any emotional involvement with the characters . the camera is the only star of this film . in the end , this became a very annoying picture that promised so much and only delivered what could be best described , as superficial entertainment .

"and , though each of these characters is unique , there exists at least one common element amongst them ( other than the obvious ) -- they are all three-dimensional creations , individuals who attain a terrifyingly believable life . the credit for this goes to both de niro and to the writers and directors who sketched the outlines that he so ably filled in . therefore , given de niro's track record , it was reasonable to expect good things from him in the fan , director tony scott's followup to last year's blockbuster , crimson tide . in fact , with de niro playing a sociopathic baseball nut , one might be forgiven mistakenly believing that this movie had potential . unfortunately , whatever promise the idea held was lost early in the film making process . the version of the fan to reach movie screens is as unwatchable a thriller as has come to theaters this year . de niro , in fact , is part of the fan's problem . mugging it up for the camera , he gives a tasteless , uninteresting , caricature-like portrayal . after the 1994 strike , one could make the case that baseball no longer deserves anyone's respect , but it's hard to argue that it merits the ghastly treatment handed out by tony scott . the fan treats everyone associated with the game -- fans , announcers , and players -- with contempt . not only is the script superficially nasty , but the game sequences are poorly-filmed , with quick edits used to disguise the fact that hardly anyone involved ( with the possible exception of ex-major leaguer john kruk ) can actually swing the bat . actually , i might have been able to forgive the fan its liberties if it had been remotely enjoyable . but it's not -- the film replaces tension and excitement with reel after reel of tedium . the fan is disjointed , poorly paced , and , at times , completely incoherent . aside from snipes' well-tuned performance and a few clever scenes detailing superstar marketing , this picture is a veritable wasteland . even watching the horror show that the real giants have become during the 1996 season is more fun than this .

"after the wildly popular but cheesy the lost world : jurassic park , moviegoers have been wondering whether jurassic park iii , this time directed by joe johnston ( october sky and jumanji ) , would follow the usual movie rule whereby each sequel is another drop in quality from its predecessor . well , i'm here to report that jurassic park iii is a rule breaker , a smartly written and funny popcorn flick that is a lot of fun . it isn't as needlessly gory as lost world , so it should appeal to younger ages , and the screenwriters , first-timer peter buchman and the citizen ruth and election team of alexander payne and jim taylor , pack plenty of goodies for older viewers as well . and the monsters , i mean dinosaurs , are more realistic than ever , including some new flying dinosaurs . the corollary is guessing who will survive to the end , which is typically easy since you are usually safe figuring out the salary of the stars and then reasoning that the studios will want to get the most bang for their buck . this means that eluding them proves extra tricky . the script lets the humans find just enough tools of various kinds to make it . ingenuity is at a premium and the survivors evidence both courage and brains . the best part of the movie may be the length . just when you are completely satisfied and before you ever have a chance to get tired and start checking your watch , the movie concludes quickly and efficiently . and it ends without any doubt as to whether the studio wants to call an end to the jurassic park franchise . it is rated pg-13 for intense sci-fi terror and violence and would be acceptable for kids around 8 and up , depending on how well they handle monster violence . my son jeffrey , age 12 , gave it * * * * . he said it was much better and not as blood thirsty as lost world . he thought the plot was cool and the graphics were great . he liked the way it related back to the original in story , style and music . in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word "" subscribe "" in the subject line .

"there is no doubt about the oppressiveness of the chinese communist regime , and this film , more than any other that i have seen , recently , presents the devastating emotional conflicts the communist revolution has done to its people , even though , it is not overtly critical of them . it is beautifully filmed in the style of a formal chinese landscape painting , using the commonplace to be viewed as something that goes beyond its present linear form , to give it an eternal flavor from what it might first appear like . the narrator tells us that in chinese , umbrella sounds very similar to separation . he is so insignificant to the story , that we never even see him . he mails most of the money he stole to qiuyi , and he gives enough for xiao to have a week's worth of pleasure . that is about as optimistic as it gets for this bitter tale of politics and romance , told from a woman's point of view . this is a very serious , stylized film , artistically filmed with many long angle camera shots , that give the film a depth that goes beyond the mere telling of the story , though it seemed to be dragging it heels at times , as the story just hit dry spots in it . its use of color cinematography was startling , as yellow was most effectively used to both evoke a sense of renunciation and hope . this is a most interesting but not particularly penetrating film to come out of modern china , one that is most blunt and cruel in picking up the human travails and emotional discontentments that the people faced in the hands of their liberators , but not able to say too much about why these hardships are taking place .

"now that doesn't sound too radical , or does it ? nevertheless , the church has not recognized that work and in 1945 declared the work to be a heresy . that is the filmmaker's version , but he's mistaken , it was not declared heretical : upon further research i discovered that the church only said it was simply non-canonical . as for it being unattainable and suppressed by the church , that's hogwash , i've owned a copy of it since the 1970s and anyone can order it in a bookstore . that the film doesn't always stick to its aim and gets mired down in unnecessary subplots , is what disappointed me most about this story that could have been . . . well , great ! that is , if it were in the hands of a filmmaker who was more accurate in his details . the film uses the supernatural as its storyline . this very revealing statement of how inaccurate all the christian icons are magnifies the point the filmmaker is making , that even the eyewitnesses to the event all saw things their own way and to dogmatize them without questioning them , makes for a very questionable religion . director wainright tries hard to make stigmata to be an unconventional film , with a "" hip "" musical score ( smashing pumpkins ) and a mod style of camera shots and montages . by using many different fanciful camera angles , he allows you to feel the pain of the crucifixion while we see nails driven into frankie's wrists . there are many other disturbing images , such as broken glass moved by a spiritual wind , doves appearing out of nowhere , ominous bird feathers , and dripping blood , which add , unfortunately , to the incredibility of the story . during the sequences in which frankie receives her wounds , there are a number of quick cuts between her body in agony and a crucified male , and many slow motion shots emphasizing the agony over and over again . the dazzling cinematography even makes the rainy weather and bad traffic jams of pittsburgh look like an inferno , while it switches gears and goes to the contrasting opulence of the vatican and the poverty of the brazil village , where the faithful flock to the miracle church . though there are many films ( exorcist , rosemary's baby , omen ) trying their hand in this supernatural and religious thriller genre , this film tries a somewhat different look to it ( but those demon voices coming out of frankie , sure sounded like linda blair's possessed voice in the exorcist ) . some of the things the filmmaker tried to do can certainly be questioned as to their effectiveness , especially the over-the-top special effects ( especially weak was the fire during the closing scene , it was overwrought with symbolism and inaccuracies ) and , what might even be a worst cheapening of the film , was the romantic suggestions between the handsome priest and the troubled girl who just wanted to get her life back and "" loves being me . "" in my opinion , these were distractions to an already complicated story , a story if it is to be taken seriously has to remain focused on what it was aiming for and not try to tell more of the corruptions in the catholic church than it could handle . the romantic hints between the two were fine to a certain extent , it made the point that a priest's disavowal of sex has its complications just like sex does for ordinary people . but when it went for overkill and tried to show how human the priest was , that he was more affected by saving the girl's life and giving her love than he was in preserving church dogma , i just thought it became too cheesy to show him in bed with her and ogling her like he was in love with her , that , for me , was going over the top . i have no idea where the director was trying to go with that . it just opened the film up for unnecessary criticism , and i wanted this film to succeed without those kind of distractions because i thought it was onto something . what it had to say was a rational response to such an authoritarian institution that cannot readily accept challenges from within or without . i don't see the story as an anti-religious film , as much as i saw it as a challenge to having one way of looking at religion . in order to challenge the church , there is no doubt that feathers have to be ruffled , but as i saw the film , the catholic community was mostly treated with respect and the essential need for religion was never in question . it is only from the film's ogre , sneeringly played by jonathan pryce , that we see a one-dimensional predictable performance . he is evil from- the beginning to the end- of the film , and how he ends up is just hollywood hokum , leaving me disappointed that the filmmaker would abandon their philosophical argument via the force of ideas and have to resort to making the cardinal look like a strangler . wainwright should have had enough convictions in the strong ideas he presented about his kind of religion being a personal one and should have let the quick lesson he gave us on how the church examines miracles , to be enough of a case against the church and let it go at that . i was mostly impressed with gabriel byrne as a priest . his low-key approach to this role was the glue that held the film together and made it possible for non-believers such as me , to believe that there was some faint hope for the church to actually be spiritual in a universal and unbiased sense . i just couldn't warm up to her sexy dumb hairdresser characterization , it seemed too funky and since she was the brunt of most of the special effects , it all seemed like an exorcist movie going on for too long , losing any rationality and prospective of what this film was supposed to be about . depending on what you are looking for when you view this movie , is what kind of reaction you should have to it . if you view it as a horror movie , then you are in for a big disappointment . this film is more silly than scary , and less funny than risible . but if you look upon it as a challenging religious conspiratory film , the way i saw it , a film that examines the past power structure of the church and the power that the church has today , then you might see a film that is more interesting than you would be led to believe by the way it was advertised and by the way some critics felt that it was their duty to defend the "" poor "" catholic church from such an attack . in any case , i thought the film was not anti- religious , just critical of churchly abuses , which makes it a disturbing film in some circles . in my opinion , despite all its faults , the film is still a thinking man's film . that the church has blindly protested the movie , is of no concern to me . the filmmakers have not disavowed the institution of the church or belief in a god , but just question its search for truth . the film raised some serious questions that should be answered by the church . this film should be seen as an opportunity for the church to see what those who are critical of it are saying and they should not be afraid of the truth , even if it means they have to change . it is easy to lose track that this film is a serious one , despite the mtv feel the movie has to it , and that is what surprised me more than anything else about it . but what makes it fascinating , is why the filmmaker thinks the church can be toppled by this new gospel . in the past the church has always been able to be astute and co-opt anything it gets its hands on , for its own benefit . a better film would have veered away from the sensational and stuck to the nuts and bolts of its argument . but with that being said , it is interesting to hear what the director rupert wainwright says , `it was our goal to present this story as an unbelievable , yet wholly possible phenomenon , ' and like it or not that's what the film does .

"chelsea clinton must have it rough . and , unlike child movie and tv stars , this isn't something she chose -- it's a role that was thrust upon her . though it may be slim consolation , at least her situation isn't as bleak as that of luke davenport ( brock pierce ) , the title character of disney's latest lame-brained live-action feature , first kid . to me , the concept of making a movie about the child of a president seems like a good idea . there's a dramatic goldmine inherent in the situation . while a great film could be made from this subject matter , first kid isn't it . disney doesn't want hard-hitting , welcome to the dollhouse-type realism . they want lightweight , feel-good family fare -- the kind of movie that can turn a modest profit without offending anyone . part of the problem is that , despite the title , this film isn't so much about the first son as it is about his secret agent , sam simms . simms is played by sinbad , and this is obviously a vehicle for the comic-turned-actor . in fact , it's his second starring role for disney - - he last appeared in the wretched houseguest , which played like a feature-length commercial for mcdonalds . you'd have to be blind or asleep to miss either . not everything in first kid is bad . there are times when we feel for luke , although never as deeply as we should . it probably would have helped if he hadn't started out the film as such a dislikeable brat . and some of sinbad's comic antics can't help but be funny -- this guy has got an abundance of charisma . unfortunately , comedy and light drama aren't the only things on first kid's agenda . the film ends with an extended action sequence that is ( unintentionally ) more laughable than sinbad's best routine . we get to see the star do his clint eastwood imitation by getting in the line of fire . by aiming his film at children , director david mickey evans strips the movie of all potentially interesting elements , leaving behind material likely to appeal to only the least discriminating viewers . then again , most disney live-action features are about the same , so there shouldn't be any real surprises where first kid is concerned . the just-completed democratic national convention was better-scripted than this film .

"trekkies , roger nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary , brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions . the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike . ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs . trekker polemic as not worth arguing about . ) the good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable , loud giggles , yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe . in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary ( oed ) . unless you've been to the conventions , i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans . one pointed out , apologetically , that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate . others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended , several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of . arguably the most famous of all the trekkies , she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die-hard fans do . she doesn't quite understand all of the uproar . along with the laugher the show evokes , there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty . and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment . few other avocations could give this much satisfaction . ( for the record , i'm not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies . ) the film interviews the various star trek series's stars as well as its fans . at one , the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel . with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity . not just flitting among people , the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies . the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the series's larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns . sandwiched in-between the levity , the switch in tone doesn't work . he fits right in . trekkies runs a breezy 1 : 26 . it is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages .

"how can a bad film be good ? well , in the hands of edgar g . ulmer , it is possible to end a film with an overbearing melodramatic paranoia to it , on the edgy words of the protagonist , who wonders to himself how , "" fate could put the finger on you and me for no good reason at all , "" and not be laughed at as pretentious dialogue . instead , this work becomes a memorable cult film that can so easily in lesser hands than the skilled ulmer , have fallen into the realm of inanity , but here becomes a strong film about the meaning of fate . what is most amazing , though , is that this film was shot in six days in a poverty row studio on an extremely low budget , without an attempt to get any location shots for a story that centers around a cross-country hitchhiking trip , and yet it remains gritty and realistic even if the film is full of technical errors . it remains fully a part of the rich history of b&w noir films . it is also an example of what the big studios can't seem to do well , how in their attempt to make a film that is pleasing to a large market share of the audience , they too often lose track of how interesting a story can be without the usual formula applied to it or the need for making it glitzy , and they fail to get into the soul of their stars , where they should have been going in the first place . which might explain how this poorly acted , weakly-crafted story , was so much applauded by film buffs that it has reached classical cult status in film lore and is even revered by certain noted directors such as martin scorsese , and was held-up by the french movie critics as a work of true art when they discovered the neglected film in 1950 . in a voiceover , he asks , "" did you ever want to forget anything and can't because there is always something that comes up to remind you of what you were trying to forget ? "" the most memorable part of the film , the part that seemed the eeriest and most convincing comes next , as al starts to panic and can't think clearly . he goes over in his mind the choices he has , as he keeps saying to himself who would believe me if i told them what happened : 1 ) my first instinct tells me to run . 2 ) the next possibility is to sit tight and wait for the cops . his weak character and not his criminal act of stealing haskell's identity are the cause of his downfall . ulmer has created an unusually bleak character study , that plays like a mesmerizing confession , as the hero has the intangible quality of innocence going for him , which adds a seductive quality to his character for those in the audience , such as me , who can appreciate his natural inclination not to trust the authorities , even when that seems to be the most rational thing to do in the dire predicament he was in . to understand that , is to begin to understand the power of a noir film , probably the most original cinematic work the american film industry has produced . the noir hero is just not like the other hollywood heroes ; he does not see the world in technicolor .

"dirty ballet dancing , released under the pseudonym of center stage , tries to make the hard and competitive world of ballet dancing as much fun as rock and roll . not since jennifer grey and patrick swayze cut a rug in the catskills has a movie so wanted to demonstrate the sensuous joy of moving one's body to a beat . although center stage doesn't really find its groove until the last act , its dance numbers are well worth the price of admission . just try to forgive the amount of celluloid director nicholas hytner ( the object of my affection and the crucible ) wastes on the story's hackneyed romances . screenwriter carol heikkinen subscribes to the "" one of "" theory of script design , so the dozens of dancers include : one gay , one bulimic , one not skinny , one loud mouth , one black male and one hispanic female . the rest are so interchangeable that you'll wish that they had numbers on them to make it easier to tell them apart . and since the writer doesn't want to make a choice , she tries to shoehorn in way too many stories , all at the expense of the dance sequences , which is the only reason to see the movie in the first place . one of the film's most instructive and fascinating segments has the ballet dancers using everything from fire to water in order to get their toe shoes into just the right shape . the dancers endure incredible pain for the slim chance that they'll hit the big time , and the chorus -- in which you can tell your friends that you're the third one from the left -- is the most that even the better students can realistically hope for . speaking almost in whispers , the instructors give their generally mild critiques . light-years away from the drill instructor style that one would expect , they are so quiet that it's a miracle that the dancers can hear them . but the story's limitations become mere quibbles when the dancing starts . the best of the dancers , ethan stiefel as cooper nielsen , amazes us with his high flying , twirling bravado . when he engages another in a dazzling dancing duel , there's never any question as to who will emerge as the winner . although not his equal in technical skill , amanda schull as jody sawyer , plays the dancer with the most heart . when they perform the long ending sequence together , the movie sizzles , and the choreography wows us with its inviting originality . see it first on the big screen , and later , when it goes to video , hit the fast-forward button every time the dancing stops . it is rated pg-13 for language and some sensuality and would be fine for kids around 11 or 12 and up .

"there is a movement afoot in the movie business to restore some of the great classic films so that this generation can see them afresh . some of the work like that done on the umbrellas of cherbourg allows the movie to be better even than that seen by even the original movie audience . so it is with the restoration of alfred hitchcock's 1958 masterpiece vertigo . working with some of the original master tapes , the restorers have given the film a digital stereo sound track . hearing bernard herrmann's music conducted by that great master muir mathieson makes the effort worthwhile . his haunting melodies are quite dramatic with the horns using their lowest notes . that the restorers also give us a cleaned up print and vastly improved color rendition is a bonus . restoration is a difficult process depending on many factors . here the result is less than perfect , which is not meant as a criticism . the interior sequences are bursting with rich and highly textured colors , but the exterior ones still seem a bit washed out . there are a couple of scenes where the print gets too dark and where the color matching is off . on the whole , however , the restoration works , and it is a joy to see this classic in its full glory . this feeling of acrophobia or vertigo is nothing more than a plot device . it provides the glue that holds the mystery of the story together . what makes the film so compelling are the characters swept up in the vertigo of the mystery . bel geddes is easily the most likable actor in the story . midge's costumes by the great edith head and the make-up by wally westmore give her the image of a good looking nerd . she has attractive but overly conspicuous glasses , and clothes that are all too sensible . if you love san francisco as much as i do , and especially if you live near it as i do , the movie provides more gorgeous san francisco settings for you to savor than any other movie . period . it was an awful film , but as i sat watching the expensive and slow minutia of a film shoot , i keep reflecting back to hitchcock's work there over three decades earlier and in the same spot outside . the camera work by robert burks is a masterful blend of wide-angle zooms to create the vertigo effect in the audience and of a traditional and panoramic approach . the automobile's role in movies has changed dramatically . alfred hitchcock is the king of the mysteries , which is not to say that his are without logical flaws . now that you ask , yes , hitchcock does his standard quick walk through one of the scenes . this "" where's waldo "" is a favorite of hitchcock fans like myself , and i certainly will give you no hints when this occurs . novak gives a wooden performance in the first half , but is quite intriguing in the second when she comes back to life as judy barton . stewart has not given a bad performance in his life . his acting as an obsessed man in vertigo is good , but not his best . just a couple of examples . ultimately what makes vertigo work so well is the direction by the great master and the stunning music and visuals . my main criticism of the film is that the editing by george tomasini is too slow . the film would have been more effective if more tightly focused and about fifteen more minutes had been left on the cutting room floor . the ending of the show is perfect and shocking if you have never seen it before . vertigo remains a classic bit of cinema that is worth seeing again . i would love to see some local theater do an alfred hitchcock festival . hint . hint . vertigo runs 2 : 08 . it is not rated but would be pg today due solely to the falling scenes . there is no sex , nudity , or bad language . the film will probably only interest kids say ten and up , but would be acceptable kids a little younger . i strongly recommend you check out the restoration now on the big screen as it was meant to be seen and heard . i give the film * * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"moreau boldly announces that it is a movie not to be ignored . not since seven have i seen such impressive opening credits . that the movie turned out to be as much a religious allegory as an h . g . wells science fiction story , i would have never guessed . i asked several of the other critics after the press screening if they knew if the book had the religious aspects in it , but having not read the book in years , none of them had any idea . personally , i have no problem enjoying stories that are very loose adaptations of books , but still i wondered . i love wells , and this is the first book of his to be made into a movie in twenty years , the last being empire of the ants . you may remember british actor thewlis from his many recent roles including dragonheart , restoration , and black beauty , which is still his best . he is one handsome guy in this getup , but i still do not know why norma moriceau chose this costume for kilmer . even stranger , but somewhat more appropriate is the all white outfit and gloves along with the white pancake makeup that marlon brando wears as dr . moreau . got so bad you couldn't cut a rat without reading him his rights .

"screenplay : rod lurie . director : rod lurie . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 125 minutes . it's clear that lurie has a lot of interesting things say about contemporary american politics on a national level . it's equally clear that he still has a few things to learn about turning those things into smoothly satisfying film stories . questions regarding the pertinence of private life to public service have certainly been part of the political landscape in recent years , making the contender's subject matter timely food for thought . oldman makes for a superb antagonist as the cutthroat runyon , whose motivations are always swaying between genuine conviction that hanson isn't ready for the job and retribution for earlier political losses to the president . there are fine moments exploring the slippery slopes on which politicians walk in order to gain power , none more effective than a scene in which hanson -- armed with information that could allow her to make an effective personal attack on runyon -- is forced to decide whether or not to use it . the excruciatingly long silence in that scene says more about the tension between principle and expedience than any line of dialogue . that's also one of the few moments in the contender when lurie nails the timing of a scene . throughout the film , there's a sense that virtually every scene is about a minute too short , that virtually every character or sub-plot has been short-changed in some fashion . hanson herself remains enigmatic through much of the film , robbing the film of a real protagonist for the audience to embrace . and lurie sticks too closely to the insider wheelings and dealings , never venturing into the realm of public opinion to explore how scandals affect the public . the contender has the scope of an epic political drama without enough of the detail . fortunately for lurie , he scores several points for detail with jeff bridges' performance as president evans . plenty of actors have essayed portrayals of american presidents with an emphasis either on sheer authoritative presence or flawed humanity . bridges nails both , switching from genial charm to icy political determination in the blink of an eye . it's a near-perfect piece of film acting , capturing every one of a modern chief executive's many faces ; he even gives a kick to the obligatory climactic preachy-speechy . that's the only bit of greatness the contender can muster , however ; it's otherwise a merely solid piece of drama . perhaps next time around , rod lurie will pick up a few lessons from bridges on putting all the pieces together around a persuasive ideological core . such is the stuff of a great leader , whether behind the camera , or behind the desk in the oval office . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"screenplay : richard curtis . director : mike newell . where romantic comedy is concerned , i am a tough sell . too many of them seem to put across the impression that all you need to do is put two people on the screen and have them end up together , regardless of whether or not they are developed with an interesting conflict ( or even speak to one another , as in the monstrously overhyped sleepless in seattle ) . i'm not going to turn into a pile of goo every time i see a screen kiss , but i will respond if i've spent two hours with two well-developed characters who seem to belong together . the new british comedy four weddings and a funeral delivers only halfway . hugh grant turns in a charming , star-making performance in this uneven character piece , but andie macdowell always appears to be more of a prop than a person . four weddings and a funeral was written by richard curtis , co-creator of the popular british television import "" black adder , "" a series not renowned for its sentimentality . and four weddings is extremely winning when it's not focusing on relationships . there are enough of these lively set pieces that four weddings rarely lags for too long , and the laughs come at fairly regular intervals . part of the problem is that in an attempt to create yet another ensemble friends piece he overloads the film with supporting characters , giving short shrift to the crucial relationship between charles and carrie . only james fleet , as befuddled aristocrat tom , provides any spark to the proceedings . the simple fact is that i kept losing track of the relationships between all these people , and didn't particularly care when i could figure them out . this lack of focus is inexcusable considering the cursory treatment carrie's character is given . part of four weddings and a funeral's message about love is that we should all be looking for that one person who makes "" lightning strike , "" and while the romantic sentiment is laudable it also assumes that we as an audience should recognize it when we see it . hugh grant , looking frighteningly like harold lloyd in his horn-rims , is an absolute delight ; he turns charles into a wonderful , funny , fallible character , and we want to see him happy . but carrie is simply a plot device . we know virtually nothing about her except that charles has a crush on her , and andie macdowell is not subtle enough an actress to fill in the blanks . it also might have been helpful to understand charles' romantic history better , which could have been accomplished through a more complete picture of ex-girlfriend henrietta , but that too is absent . there is much to recommend four weddings and a funeral as a comedy ; it's bright and spirited and well-paced . as a romance , it leaves much to be desired . . . primarily a second party for the romantic pairing .

"" suffice it to say that he is no robin williams . to be fair to dan castellaneta , the plot for the return of jafar can be summarized as let's get the old cast together , have them cavort in the same settings , sing some songs and generally kill the minimum amount of time necessary for something to be called a movie rather than a short . in this case , the picture does fill 66 minutes of video tape and can , therefore , just barely be legitimately referred to as a feature length movie . with his toothy smile and boyish good looks , aladdin is back along with his gorgeous girlfriend jasmine , wearing her same slightly revealing costume . their voices are done by scott weinger and linda larkin and , like most of the rest of the cast with the exception of williams , are the same as in the original . in a movie about which it is hard to find positive things to say , the songs , while far from memorable , at least are tuneful and full of energy . before watching this tape , we tried the 1970 movie scrooge with albert finney , where the songs are so pitiful that they sound more like sung dialog . the songs in the return of jafar , none of which i can remember now , did have at least possess plenty of pep and sounded like real songs . jafar ( jonathan freeman ) with his sinister little goatee is up to his old tricks -- like most of this unimaginative movie , there are few new tricks . the show plays more like a series of outtakes from the original than a sequel . the only way you can tell this is not the case is the absence of williams . the jokes are not particularly funny or original . even disney's usual superlative animation isn't up to par . looking at the credits , it appears that much of the drawing was farmed out . all and all , the return of jafar is a pretty lame film . the return of jafar runs 1 : 06 , which means less than an hour if you exclude the credits . it is not rated but would be a g and is suitable for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 8 , thought it was "" pretty good , "" and claimed he liked it almost as much as the original since the same characters are back .

"the sound of music ( 1965 ) was one of the most popular films of the 1960s . although a bit corny , it is a joyous musical odyssey suitable for the entire family . today , too often what goes for musicals , see for example evita , is little more that a show with a single decent song . in the sound of music every song is tuneful and most are memorable and moving . some shows are meant to be seen in a movie theater on a large screen with an impressive sound system to match . the sound of music is one of them . nevertheless , our family enjoyed it at home . we have a high quality home theater setup , but the full effect can only be experienced in a real theater . i have not seen the film that way in thirty years . this review is from the home viewing rather than my memory . the academy award for best picture for 1965 went to the sound of music as did that for director robert wise .

"as zorro wins the match , elena grabs a hat to cover herself just fast enough so that the film can keep its pg-13 rating . if the audience has by then grown tired of this overly long and confusing production , this sensuous sword fight will easily rejuvenate their interest in the movie . the mask of zorro by goldeneye's director martin campbell features lavish sets and golden cinematography in addition to swashbuckling action and an uncountable number of explosions . the script by john eskow and godzilla's terry rossio and ted elliott is the film's low point . so confusing that you may never get straight who is fighting whom and why , the movie is sorely in need of a narrator . they open the movie with a huge block of text which helps some if the audience can remember it all . the good news is that swordmaster bob anderson choreographed the sword fights beautifully . you'll recognize anderson's techniques and style . it is best to enjoy the fight sequences and ignore the bewildering explanations of who is on what side and why . stick to the basic rule that zorro and the peasants are good and that anyone with money is bad , and you'll be able to follow enough of the storyline to get you by . banderas with true comedic flair uses great bravado and lots of luck but less than the requisite skill in his first attempts at challenging dozens of men . most of the story is a rehash of numerous others . if you love swashbucklers or if you're a banderas fan , you'll probably want to put the movie in your must-see category . the mask of zorro runs way too long at 2 : 16 . it is rated pg-13 for some intense action and violence and would be fine for kids around 9 or 10 and up . my son jeffrey , age 9 , said the movie was "" really good "" and gave it * * * . he liked all of the swordplay , but was frightened by such scenes as the realistic pickled head and hand in a jar .

"director : mel smith . a couple of years ago , director barry levinson made a movie based on a twenty-year-old idea . this pet project was loud , heavy-handed and self-indulgent , and clearly showed why it hadn't been made twenty years earlier : it wasn't a very good idea . however , levinson had acquired the cachet to make any movie he wanted to make , so he made toys . george lucas has even more cachet , and he also decided to produce a twenty-year-old idea . radioland murders is an attempt at farce that is simply chaotic and grating , and its frantic pace can't disguise the fact that it just isn't funny . however , there is a lot more going on backstage than onstage . for nearly its entire first hour , radioland murders succeeded primarily in giving me a terrible headache . the story rockets from character to character , lingering just long enough to let us see that each one is defined almost exclusively by a single annoying character trait . subtle nuance in characterization may be too much to expect from a broad comedy like radioland murders , but it's still a problem when virtually the entire cast is so irritatingly one-note that you begin hoping various characters will be the next to die . they are also stuck with dialogue that must have had whiskers on it in 1939 , like the ever-uproarious "" you may think you know what i know , but i don't think you know what you think you know "" bit . the slapstick is better , but it too is simply too stale to sustain the energy . every time he does so , radioland murders just stops dead , and it's not worth the jerky ride simply to see cameos by billy barty , rosemary clooney and george burns . ultimately , that decision is indicative of what is most wrong with radioland murders : no one seems clear exactly what it is supposed to be . a backstage farce a la noises off ? a romantic comedy ? lucas and his team of screenwriters seem to want it all , and as a result they end up without much of anything . radioland murders is one of those unfortunate films which equates loud and fast with entertaining , when in reality it's simply noisy and busy .

""" [ready to wear/pret-a-porter] is just a silly little movie , it's not a serious epic . so just enjoy , laugh with it , have a good time . it's no big deal . "" - robert altman , director of ready to wear despite some delicious moments , this sluggish , overlong , halfhearted satire feels like a movie that wanted to go somewhere but never got there . with punches pulled and fangs capped , this look at high fashion is not at all what was expected from the director of the player , one of the most vicious and biting sendups of the last two decades . first of all , there are far too many characters . a cast list like the one above looks good on paper , but no actor gets more than a handful of scenes , which leads to a pervasive sense of apathy regarding almost everyone . neither of them seems any more substantial than the garments worn by the models in the climactic fashion show . at least three of the subplots could have been excised altogether . eliminating these might have streamlined ready to wear to make it more palatable . it certainly would have cut down the running time . it's not that altman can't work with a large cast--he did an admirable job in short cuts . the problem here is that his stories aren't particularly well-focused . the best scenes are often those where dialogue overlaps and the various subplots intersect . that's not to claim there's nothing effective in ready to wear . nevertheless , ready to wear doesn't have enough substance to justify its length , nor does it possess enough raw humor to leaven the flat spots . the jokes are inconsistently funny , with some being worth giggles , some eliciting hearty chuckles , and some prompting little more than shrugs . altman is a marvelously talented director . there's no denying that . films like m * a * s * h , nashville , the player , and short cuts have proven his skill several times over . and , while ready to wear is far from his best work , neither is it equivalent to much of the trash present on so many multiplex screens this season . the fashion industry can heave a sigh of relief that altman has spared it the full force of his guns . this film isn't likely to provoke much outrage from anyone except those expecting something as searing as the player . ready to wear keeps its jabs clothed , and by the time it strips away the layers of covering ( both literally and figuratively ) , it's a little too late . the above represents the opinions of the author , and not necessarily those of bellcore or any organization within bellcore .

"it's rather interesting--and a little discouraging--that the bulk of theatrical science fiction is actually far better suited to the action genre than to anything else . timecop is a perfect example . as a shoot- 'em-up , blast-'em-to-pieces film , it's not half bad . as a futuristic time travel movie , however , it has some very serious problems . nevertheless , as it stands , this is one of jean-claude van damme's better motion pictures . considering how abysmal some of the entries on his resume have been , that's not saying much , but everyone has to start somewhere . van damme isn't much of an actor , but he has advanced beyond the stagnant stage in which steven seagal is mired . at least for the moment , he's arnold schwarzenegger ( unamerican accent and all ) without the price tag . any film whose premise relies as heavily as timecop's does on time travel is inherently treading on dangerous ground . paradoxes abound in films like this , and how a script deals with them often determines the success of the movie . timecop doesn't attempt to ignore these problems--in fact , it makes one of them a key ingredient in the resolution--but the explanations are less-than-thorough and the logic is porous . the plot is actually a little more substantial than that of most van damme movies . the film's scientific and technological views may be on the shaky side , but at least it doesn't commit the cardinal sin of attempting to explain time travel . such technobabble-laced expositions typically sound ludicrous . as far as the action sequences are concerned , there are plenty of them , all of which are competently-executed ( even if every one of them seems to happen in the midst of a downpour ) . the tension never comes close to the level of a speed , but timecop is unlikely to put anyone to sleep . sadly , a lackluster music score by mark isham does little to elevate the adrenaline level . while this villain isn't close to the standards of die hard's hans grueber , he's still pretty easy to dislike . bruce mcgill turns in a solid supporting performance as the head of the tec police force . timecop is in the total recall category of storytelling : take a popular action film star , throw him into a science fiction setting , add a few minor plot twists , and let him blast and punch his way out of trouble . as far as this formula is concerned , timecop lacks much of total recall's wit and cleverness . concerning the time travel issues , don't think too deeply , otherwise you're likely to realize just how poorly-considered the script's treatment of them is . time paradoxes are supposed to be mind-boggling ; timecop has reduced them to a level somewhere between confusing and dumb .

"perhaps if the impostors didn't have so much going for it , it wouldn't have been such a tremendous disappointment . written , directed , and produced by one of its two stars , stanley tucci , whose last picture was the indie smash hit , big night , the impostors almost never catches fire . sputtering like a two-day old campfire , the story plays like an ad-lib sketch that was never polished or completed . the film's other star , oliver platt , was hilarious as the senator's aide in bulworth . the bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent , including woody allen , steve buscemi , hope davis , alfred molina , campbell scott , lili taylor and tony shalhoub . all are wasted save allen , who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes . ( the audience will easily identify with allen's sentiments . ) with the exception of a single original joke involving mirror-imaged subtitles , the movie engenders little genuine laughter . the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it . the over-the-top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer . at other times , we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else , while darting in and out of staterooms . with the film's chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage , it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce . the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having . too bad they weren't more concerned with the audience's potential enjoyment . the jokes , frequently framed in silence , fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground . one wonders if anyone ever viewed the film's dailies . surely , if they had , they would have realized what leaden results they were producing . it is tricky having good actors play bad ones , but , if they couldn't pull it off , they should have just given up . the mystery is why they didn't all give up in the beginning . there must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast . it is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up .

"fear of a black hat is the 1990s version of this is spinal tap , skewering rap music on the same stake that rob reiner used to impale heavy metal . for three-quarter of its running length , this is a first- rate parody of the most bawdy kind . it is unapologetically politically incorrect , and some of the biggest laughs come at the most off-color jokes . there's virtually no stone in the world of rap music left unturned by black hat , which has something to say about everything from drug dealing and gun violence to the new wave of black film directors . as was the case with spinal tap , the premise behind fear of a black hat is that someone is doing a documentary . the film opens with a warning to the audience that fear of a black hat will make use of a number of potentially offensive terms , but does not intend to do so gratuitously . it then repeats each of those words several times , and prints them on the screen for good measure . from this moment on , we know that we're in the hands of an accomplished satirist , and the result is predictably better than other feeble efforts such as cb4 and those elements of the wayne's world movies which tried something similar . from that point on , the jokes come faster than the uses of the word . the parodies of rap videos are inspired--writer/director rusty cundieff injects an mtv-like glamor , but makes sure that each possesses all sorts of excesses . with titles like "" guerrillas in the midst "" and "" my peanuts "" with lyrics that will not be reprinted here , cundieff has found rich ground to hoe . almost every facet of the rap culture gets similar treatment . a marquee in chicago refuses to use the word "" niggaz , "" so it calls nwh "" negroes with hats .

"i was disappointed in hartley's most ambitious film to date ; i expected more than what was delivered . henry fool can best be viewed as an allegory of the good-guys ( non-conformist ) versus the bad guys ( the establishment ) . for hartley aficionados , his comedy is still there in flashes , his trademark drone conversations and absurd situational humor : a marriage proposal takes place between henry and parker while he is taking a wicked dump , this is the best and most powerful scene in the film . but the film is boring at times and belabors its points , and goes on for too long without seeming to be moving with a spark of credibility or in any one direction ; and , is at best , an uneven attempt to say something serious ( which hartley should be applauded for ) . but the film gets bogged down in telling too many different stories , such as , one of domesticity , neighborhood values , and the business of getting published . i wanted to like this film and i thought about why i didn't feel comfortable viewing it for a long time after seeing the movie , and i still found that what i got from the film were some chuckles from the zany characters , but what i was not clear about , was what else i was supposed to get from this film . it just didn't add up as a work of drama , it failed to provide a proper tension between plot and character .

"" how to get ahead in advertising "" is a tirade against the phony world of advertising and the screams denouncing that industry seemed like sweet music to my ears up to a point , as the message of the film eventually moved from being funny to becoming shrill and overwhelming , even to someone like me who was sympathetic to the script . ad men could very well be the lowest souls on the food chain on planet earth , is a point that doesn't have to be nailed into me before i get it . the point being made , is that both the business world and the world of science are ready to sell almost any product to make a buck , as they both exist by giving the public what they want . this is a film that rants on throughout , as it starts off very funny and then moves into sermonizing about the corrupt industry . the huckster's motto being : if you want to sell pimple cream , you have to encourage people to have pimples . the cast play their parts with the earnest intensity and gullibility required , with richard grant showing a lot of energy and a tremendous ability to verbalize . it's an unusual picture , one worth a look at for those who don't mind pure nuttiness instead of dramatics and tension in a story . it sounds far-reaching , a ghastly cry against the excesses of materialism , or does it ?

"" unfortunately , in adding maturity , too much spontaneity was taken away . it looks like murphy is going to have to try again for that comeback . ",2
"credit 20th century fox marketing with a first in my tenure as a critic : along with the press notes for pushing tin , they included a copy of the source material . it was a superb piece of reportage turned into a compelling story . there may be a great film to be made from that story , but pushing tin isn't it . for about the first half hour , and sporadically thereafter , pushing tin is actually about the high-pressure world of air traffic controllers . director mike newell employs computer graphics effectively to get us inside how controllers see their domain , and keeps up a brisk pace to match the frantic energy of the characters . meanwhile , writers glen & les charles ( co-creators of "" cheers "" ) do a nice job with the camaraderie and gallows humor that keeps everyone sane . in fact , just about everything is right with pushing tin except its central storyline . cusack and thornton are such talented actors that it might take longer than usual to register that their conflict has virtually nothing to do with the world of air traffic controllers . there was a mini-series' worth of psychological material in darcy frey's article , but pushing tin instead chooses the mundane head-butting of nick and russell , combined with smirky seductions and marital squabbles . it's a conflict that appears to have been pasted over this backdrop by people who had no idea what to do with it for a major studio film except tell a generic studio film story . there's no reason for pushing tin to be a film about rival air traffic controllers if this was the story they were going to tell ; it could just as easily be a film about rival matadors , or rival insurance salesmen , or rival periodontists . the lack of a solid center really shows in the final 45 minutes , when the film falls apart completely . there's a bumpy flight , a bomb scare , a zen immersion in a mountain stream and a showdown with jet engines , none of which makes the characters more than the broad sketches they've been from the start . that'll teach fox to give us a glimpse into what might have been . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"he did not like the service , saying he saw many terrible things there , so many dead people as a result of war , even though he was only a butcher there , it had an awful affect on him . this does not disturb our butcher , who comes by the school offering helene a leg of lamb as if it were a bouquet . the most memorable scene in the film , is when the children are on an outing in the woods and one of the girls is about to bite into her roll , when a red spot appears on it , looking like jam . that she doesn't say anything , but continues seeing popaul strikes me as odd . but this is what adds to the flavor of this methodically simple story . the flawed characters are what elevate this film into something other than a straight mystery story , because getting the murderer is not the theme of the film , as much as trying to understand something that is complex about human nature . it is hard to figure what is happening internally in the budding relationship between popaul and helene , but it is definetly not a sexual one . that was pretty much the theme chabrol used in his first film , shot 10 years before this one , le beau serge , which also took place in a rural village . but this time , the theme is more fully developed by a director who has greatly matured . this is chabrol at his best , equal to hitchcock . spinning an eerie psychological thriller , whose likable characters and the nostalgic village they live in , are painted with a master's elegant brushstrokes . it seems films such as this one , never get dated . it gets better every time i see it . this time i was better able to notice the serene landscape in the background , the magnificent limestone caves , and the casual manner village life went on , giving this film a very natural atmosphere . as a result , this is a very satisfying film .

"starring : kurt russell , james spader , jaye davidson . director : roland emmerich . stargate is a movie from out of a time warp , and i'm not just talking about the plot . stargate feels a lot like many of those films : overblown , underwritten , yet still moderately entertaining . perhaps it was the sense of nostalgia it inspired in me , but stargate offered just enough to keep me interested , despite all of its bombast and unfulfilled promise . for the first half hour , stargate seems to be pretty comfortably on the right track , with a solid premise . spader in particular is quite appealing , playing the perfect slightly dazed academic ; the early scenes in which he shows up the military scientists are low-key and quite a lot of fun . in fact , for all its $50 million scale , spader may be the best thing stargate has going for it . unfortunately , he makes kurt russell look like a large piece of plywood by comparison . as such he fits right in with the rest of the advance team , an interchangeable collection of macho grunts . once we get to the other side of the stargate , things are still wildly uneven , and we're not even talking about those plausibility questions that plague most science fiction fare . the real issue is that as good as stargate looks , it's awfully slow-moving . the sets and costume design are impressive , and even the desert sandscapes have a certain beauty to them . but stargate falls victim to its attempts at creating a fully-realized alternative civilization . it's a nice touch that they don't speak the "" miracle english "" common to alien civilizations , but it makes the soldiers' interactions with them extremely tedious . the fascination of some of the younger ones with the human aliens is believable , but a scene involving one of them reacting to kurt russell's lighter as magic is as old as the hills . it's as though director and co-scripter roland emmerich paid so much attention to cultural detail that he missed the big picture--providing a truly engaging story . the climax of stargate is a major improvement , full of energy and creativity . it's a shame that jaye davidson's ra is such a boring villain , gliding along through the ship making imperious pronouncements in a voice bearing a frightening similarity to that of jabba the hut . there is really very little in ra's role except ordering guards around , so the threat isn't nearly as threatening as it might be . the bottom line , though , is that even as i was thinking about how ridiculous some of the resolutions were ( including final decisions made by both russell's and spader's characters ) , i realized that i had enjoyed myself . and for a matinee price , i generally don't ask for much more .

"given its position in the summer blockbuster race , it's unclear how this latest picture will do , but one thing is certain : this is easily the worst filmed version of anything penned by the prolific author . with congo , paramount pictures is probably hoping to duplicate the success of universal's jurassic park . it isn't going to happen . gorillas , no matter how mean , don't hold nearly the same fascination as dinosaurs -- especially when they're really people dressed in ape suits . the tongue-in-cheek script by john patrick shanley ( who wrote moonstruck ) is inferior to the more straightforward crichton/koepp collaboration , and director frank marshall is no steven spielberg ( despite having studied under him ) . jurassic park is a solid thriller ; congo is something distinctly less . in the first place , it's difficult to build tension with so many plot threads . the first half of this film is overburdened with exposition -- but it's background that lacks character development . the whiz-bang climax , which features a lot of impressive visual effects and collapsing sets , is nicely-choreographed , but marred by adventure film cliches that get the heroes in and out of life-threatening jams . with its deus ex machina ending , congo harkens back to typical b-type adventure flicks . the actress gives an able performance , and she still looks pretty good after trudging through all that underbrush . ernie hudson is equally enjoyable to watch , and seems to be having some fun . congo's greatest asset is that it's the only pure monster movie/ adventure of the season , and , even obviously flawed as it is , it still fills a niche left vacant by the crimson tides , bravehearts , and batmans . the movie has its moments of high-energy excitement ( all during the rushed second half ) , but they don't leave the audience as breathless as they should . congo is basically a jurassic park/king kong wannabe that never quite makes the cut .

"it's not the mixture of comedy and drama--plenty of films manage to intertwine the two with aplomb ; rather , it's the vastly different performance levels of the leads . debra winger , a mature and competent actress , has developed a dramatic style that she uses to good effect . billy crystal , on the other hand , is his usual character : self-deprecating , glib , and entirely unconvincing in scenes requiring emotional displays . put simply , when winger shines , crystal is awful , and when crystal is at his best , winger fades into the background . the most apparent result is that the characters never really connect . saturday night and forget paris offer compelling evidence that crystal in his capacity as director/actor should stay away from films that require dramatic range . the man is more of a personality than a performer . he writes good jokes and has a funny delivery . in this film , his best moments occur when he's trying to make the audience laugh . the script , however , goes for slick one-liners in place of woody allen's insight , and the ending lacks emotional honesty . but what else have we come to expect from lowell ganz and babaloo mandel , kings of the happy ending ? these two dribble so much honey on every screenplay they touch that it's a wonder audiences haven't gone into sugar shock . but even this unexpected turn of events can't break the lovers apart . this is one of those rare occasions when voiceovers actually work--they allow for moments of comic flair to punctuate a story that often gets too sentimental . unfortunately , this also means that a fine supporting cast gets very little screen time . if so , he's missed the mark . with its uneven tone , forget paris doesn't have enough comedy or heartfelt romance to eclipse its faults . crystal and winger don't make a vibrant couple , and the various tribulations in their characters' relationship seem like episodes designed to set up the "" wonderful "" ending . in his second directorial stint , crystal has repeated most of the faults of his first ( the aforementioned mr . at least this time , we don't have to endure the terrible old-age makeup on top of everything else .

"it's the 1930s -- the time of the great depression . this might lead one to believe that the film is a hard-hitting indictment of politics run amuck , but it isn't . everything is rushed . robbins then quickly cuts to an entirely different group of actors telling another part of the story . among the many stereotyped characters in the cluttered script are : a giddy liberal socialite , countess lagrange ( vanessa redgrave ) , who gets her strike news delivered on a silver platter by her servants . none of the characters are compelling , and , if the movie had aired on television , i'm sure i would have turned it off long before it was over . very much in the spirit of illuminata , which opened this past summer , the fast-paced cradle will rock takes a comedic backstage look at the production of a play . and like illuminata , although it has its moments , it never comes together in anything approaching a satisfying whole . i would be inclined to suggest that you just wait for the video and use the fast forward to get to the good parts , but this would require you to fast forward through almost the entire picture , making it not worth the cost . it is rated r for language , nudity and sex and would be acceptable for teenagers .

"starring : guinevere turner , v . s . brodie , t . wendy mcmillan , anastasia sharp , migdalia melendez . screenplay : rose troche & guinevere turner . the problem with nearly every mainstream film dealing with lesbians is that they have been just so * serious * . if you believed what you saw on the screen , you'd think that every lesbian relationship involved a "" fallen "" heterosexual grappling in anguish with her sexual identity . even at their best , such "" love-that-dare-not-speak-its-name "" melodramas painted a picture that just didn't gibe the reality i have seen . what a breath of fresh air go fish is : a low-budget romantic comedy finally showing lesbians having fun and leading day-to-day lives . though uneven and amateurish enough to be occasionally distracting , go fish is mostly a frisky and funny pleasure , playing like a sort of when sally met sally . . . . go fish was a labor of love and a financial nightmare for turner and co-scripter/director rose troche , so it may seem unfair to criticize the erratic film quality and choppy editing . however , many of the rookie mistakes troche makes are difficult to pass off on economics . between scenes , she often inserts self-consciously artsy snippets of flashing lights , folded hands and spinning tops , and they just aren't in synch with the otherwise light-hearted film . it was as though troche wasn't sure she was ever going to get a chance to make a movie again , and thus threw every idea she had into this one , resulting in a somewhat scattered final product . troche is also at the mercy of her mostly non-professional cast , and they in turn are at the mercy of some occasionally very sketchy characters . the best role belongs to turner , an appealing presence with self-effacing humor . she delivers shome sharp lines with a wry wit , and anchors the scenes in which she , evy , daria and daria's amour-du-jour comment on max and ely's relationship . not so fortunate is v . s . brodie , who stumbles her way through a part written more through other characters observations than through anything ely says or does . while i have no problem with the idea that max might see past ely's unconventional looks , i would expect there to be a more interesting personality for her to find there . as underdeveloped as some of the characters might be , they still have plenty of funny things to say . in the film's opening scene , kia leads a class in speculating on what historical figures , celebrities , and even fictional characters might have been lesbians . the "" talking heads "" scenes are particularly entertaining , chief among them a discussion of preferred terms for the female genitalia . and in the film's sweetest and funniest moment , ely practically skips home after a particularly good evening with max . yet as amusing as go fish is , it is not without some frank observations on what it means to be a lesbian in the 1990's . go fish is not without its bumps and flaws , but it is both funny enough and insightful enough to warrant casting a line into its deep waters .

"in contrast , kevin lomax in devil's advocate does and finds the perks in working for god's opposition to be seductively satisfying even if there are significant drawbacks . most films dealing with the supernatural border on being unwatchably ridiculous . and fictional films about god and temptation are even worse . only the rapture and commandments come to mind as films worth seeing that cover the latter . devil's advocate , thanks to tony gilroy and jonathan lemkin's smart and witty script , based on andrew neiderman's novel , is worth adding to this short list . the picture has you alternating between thinking and laughing . in a cold sweat , kevin resolves his conscience conflict in favor of winning . as kevin , keanu reeves turns in his best performance since speed . punching out lines both powerful and humorous .

"whenever i hear an actor talk about needing to "" stretch , "" i generally feel the need to stretch my legs very far in the opposite direction . i do not mean to suggest that actors are not artists who seek out new challenges . it is simply that those who usually make the biggest noise about moving beyond one type of role in which they have been successful are also those who have lingered in that one role for a very good reason . hugh grant had become so familiar as a stammering , self-effacing light comedian that one would be forgiven for suspecting that was all he had in him . as evidence to the contrary , witness extreme measures , a solid hollywood thriller in which grant takes to the role of suspense hero like a producer to a sequel . as a rule , the hollywood suspense thrillers of recent years have been a rather sorry lot , and i believe that one of the reasons has been that constant attempts to shock are being substituted for the creation of mounting tension . director michael apted has made some of the more intriguing character-based suspense yarns of recent years ( thunderheart , blink ) , and extreme measures has a way of getting under your skin . it is an exceptionally well-paced film , with guy's dilemma growing incrementally ; its effect is based on watching guy get deeper and deeper in trouble , rather than watching him hurtle from one life-threatening confrontation to the next . there is also at least one completely unexpected turn which seems to put guy in an impossible situation , and a fight in an elevator which might truly bring you to the edge of your seat . grant is exceptionally convincing as an er surgeon , approaching every crisis with a matter-of-fact professionalism and confidence . it is tempting to play such characters as arrogant , and in the case of extreme measures it would be even more tempting so that the story could be based around a lesson about playing god . but guy is simply a scientist whose basic curiosity gets him into a completely unexpected mess , and there is such a consistency to grant's performance that his comic and dramatic moments merge seamlessly . it is an eye-opening piece of acting , and all the more challenging because grant has to carry nearly every scene . if there is one major frustration in extreme measures , it is that apted and screenwriter tony gilroy don't handle the conspiracy at its center very well . it is obvious what is going on far too early , particularly if you have seen any of the trailers which essentially give everything away . that detracts from the process of discovery , and might make you impatient as you simply wait for guy to figure out what you have known for over an hour . the conclusion tries to shove far too much into far too little time -- a physical showdown ; the outlining of a moral dilemma ; the attempt to flesh out hackman's role , which is really a glorified cameo -- resulting in a thriller which sags exactly when it should be peaking . it is fortunate that the preceding ninety minutes is so energetic and involving . it is even more fortunate that hugh grant is so well-suited to his role , and that it proves not to be such a stretch to think of him in a lab coat rather than just a morning coat .

"to make artistic films in a repressed country is very difficult , but to make documentaries for an amateur filmmaker can work simply because he is an amateur and is not expected to be after something politically dangerous , therefore he is thought of as less of a risk to those governments . kieslowski went from making documentaries to making this fictional film , and in some ways this film is semi-autobiographical , as it is about what power there is in the camera , especially for one who is an artist . philip is the central focus of the film , as he undergoes a transformation of personality . it seems that even though he didn't intend to , he hurts those who are not responsible for what he does . this is a political spoof on the artist's role and limits in communist poland and a comedy , as it comically exaggerates the film buff's growing pathology and voyeuristic tendencies . the power in the story was in the subtle reminders , showing that behind the obvious censorship , there is a real censorship problem for everyone , it is not only in the conflicts between the artist and the authorities-- but , for both the artist and the viewer who must demand that the truth and integrity of the work be preserved . poland is a good example of such a battlefield , with the then state-owned film industry in charge of funding projects , documentary films are sometimes the best records of such history , unless you have the artistic deftness , like kieslowski has shown , to make a film as wickedly ironical as this one is and get it past the censors . since the film's theme has been done many times before , and the comic efforts of the film were rather flat , what made this film provocative , was the absorbing performance by jerzy stuhr , who would become a regular in many of the director's later films , which spanned a career of over 20 years . and for showing that struggle through stuhr's eyes , the film is memorable , though it is not one of the director's top-flight artistic works , yet it is still worth seeing .

"starring : kevin costner , clint eastwood , t . j . screenplay : john lee hancock . director : clint eastwood . let's face it , kevin costner hasn't become one of the most popular movie stars in the world because he can act the hell out of a part . sure , he's been charming enough in light fare like silverado and bull durham , but he's done little to prove that his ideal dramatic role wasn't as the corpse in the big chill . it therefore might not seem to mean much to say that a perfect world features costner's best all-around performance yet , and indeed it's nothing earth-shattering . however , it's more than solid , and coupled with an impressive turn by 7-year-old t . j . lowther creates a haunting story that packs a real punch even through its superfluous subplot . it seems in the early stages that he's setting up a parallel , or is interested in creating a hunter-hunted conflict a la the fugitive , but neither reall proves true . instead we get cliche'd characters in cliche'd conflicts . there's an icy fed to get on red's nerves , and plenty of pithy good ol' boy wisdom dispensed . eastwood and dern toss off token lines of good-natured antagonism , but neither one is interesting enough to make their story at all significant . a tighter , potentially classic drama might have come from chopping their segments entirely , because the main plot is a gem . the relationship between butch haynes and philip perry is one of the most unique and interesting explored in recent years . while at first glance butch might seem to be a simple "" victim of a negative environment "" type , he's more complicated than that . the picture that develops of his father is far from clear , making butch a less than reliable narrator . costner captures a surprising amount of nuance in his portrayal of butch , one minute the doting father , the next an edgy psychotic . it's a radical change of pace for costner , and he pulls it off . perhaps the larger credit for a perfect world's success is t . j . lowther . he's not asked to say much , but his expressive face becomes one of the most vital elements in the film . the relationship between butch and philip is the heart of a perfect world , and it's nearly perfectly executed . director eastwood's first outing since his oscar for unforgiven is a similarly dark piece about a struggle for redemption , and while the whole may not be as strong as last year's best picture winner , some of the moments are even better . the opening sequence is instantly gripping , and a long shot of butch and philip walking through a field , the boy repeatedly attempting to hold the criminal's hand , is wonderful . the best sequence comes near the end , as an idyllic waltz quickly turns into a remarkably intense confrontation . eastwood draws out the ending a bit too long , but by that point i was more than willing to stick with butch and philip . a perfect world is really two films . one is mediocre at best , but the other is one of the best films of the year . together , they still add up to one of the better films of the year . a note to inside joke watchers : look for a billboard for "" bull durham tobacco "" in the sequence at friendly's store .

"" wayne's world "" was already a minor miracle by the standards of "" saturday night live "" sketches before it ever made it to the big screen . where most snl premises exhaust all charm in roughly a minute , wayne and garth provided consistent laughs . then they tempted fate by turning a five-minute sketch into a full length film , and it became a huge , goofy hit . so the question became , would the inevitable sequel finally show a concept running on fumes ? wayne's world 2 is a collection of more good-natured pokes at popular culture , propelled by the infectious exuberance of mike myers as our hero . of course , plot ultimately means very little . wayne's world , in both its television and film incarnations , is about a generation whose collective consciousness is a swirl of pop culture icons . the gags play on both genre conventions and particular images , but somehow they manage to be sharper and more "" in "" than the slew of genre parodies which littered theaters this year . the best known targets in wayne's world 2 ( kung fu films , the graduate , the doors ) get the most extensive treatments , but myers isn't afraid to pull out obscure references to mahogany rush or 70's detergent and shampoo commercials . wayne and garth , for all the inevitable comparisons , are no beavis and butthead ; they're clever and sharp- witted , simply with all their literacy derived from the media . they're in on the joke with their audience , and they're willing to assume that audience can keep up with them . social commentary aside , wayne's world 2 is just plain laugh- out-loud funny . even the most obvious gags , like the performance of village people's "" y . m . c . a . "" which is destined to become this film's "" bohemian rhapsody , "" are handled with real zest . through it all struts mike myers , sporting wayne's trademark wiseguy grin . the sense of fun he pumps into wayne is almost always engaging , and most importantly he never seems to be trying to put anything over on his audience . as a performer , his enthusiasm can make up for numerous rough edges . and there are rough edges in wayne's world 2 . christopher walken's character is basically a retread of rob lowe's from the first film , but without the campy appeal . the dana carvey/ kim basinger segments never really worked for me , primarily because i generally find carvey annoying . overall , the direction isn't as creative as penelope spheeris' work in the first , but spheeris turned out the beverly hillbillies , so maybe that makes it even . like many recent sequels , wayne's world 2 includes copycat elements from its predecessor , but far fewer than most , and there's plenty of fresh fun to be found .

"okay admit it , when you hear the title moll flanders , you think of that racy novel from high school . yes , this is the same daniel defoe book , but an excellent director , pen densham , has made it into a marvelous character study and moving motion picture . certainly , moll flanders can be a bit bawdy at times , but compared to most popular films today , the depiction of the sex here is tame . this is cinema at its best : great actors , stirring music , impressive sets , and an intelligent script . flora is a saucy and high strung girl of about 7 who is more interested in escaping that hearing some silly old morality tale . hibble is just as determined that she will listen carefully to every single word of it . the script , which i believe is a loose adaptation of the novel , stays with spirit of the book and the cadence of the speech , but takes a lot of liberties . it paints a dickensian picture of the world that stretches credulity a bit , but it was easy for me to suspend disbelieve . i bought the story lock , stock , and barrel . mrs . mazzawatti's daughters are anything but charitable , and moll is forced to leave for quite surprising reasons that you will never be able to guess in advance . give yourself some pleasure . i'll bet you've never been kissed . "" the story is wonderfully rich and varied and always keeps the audience's attention . the ending of the film is somewhat of a surprise and is extremely effective and moving . moll flanders may produce a few natural tears . although i cried a little toward the end , i never found the script manipulative . the acting was nothing short of brilliant . it is hard to have a favorite in movies of this caliber . if forced to choose , i'll go with morgan freeman's performance as the best . this luminescent actor seems incapable of anything less than a compelling performance . although this is not his best film , he is great in it . technically the movie is on par with the high quality of the acting . in fact , even better than the acting is the script by the director pen densham and the music by mark mancina . the music has an extensive range from delicate and loving to large and dramatic . i would be pleased to see this picture win many awards , but if i had to pick one , i'd give it to mark mancina for the music . the movie was filmed entirely in ireland . the snowy scenes are bleak and yet possess an inner warmth somehow thus suggesting the possibility of hope around the next corner . the costumes ( consolata boyle ) like the sets are lush and evocative without ever being unbelievably ostentatious . my favorite costume is the stern , long blue coat with the brass buttons that hibble wears . the movie flows naturally and sometimes slowly , but always with enough energy so that you remain on the edge of your seat . also the strong mood of the picture has to be credited to the director who is able to fashion just the right pieces to make it all come together . moll flanders is listed as running 2 : 49 , but i think it might be a misprint . certainly it did seem that long . however long it is , i would not want it edited down . the film is rated r . there is the brutality of that era , but it is done tastefully . there is brief sex , some nudity , but no bad language that i can remember . it would be fine for any teenager and perhaps those a bit younger . i give this show my top recommendation and award it * * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : may 13 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"the mystical theme of evil was never fully developed , but the film was well photographed and acted , and the story was very creepy . there were many odd touches that worked very well , that director freddie francis added to this original screenplay by jonathan rumbold & peter spenceley . there's also a surprise ending that fits in well with the film's theme of man's inhumanity . it makes for an above-average horror flick , one that horror fans in particular might enjoy more than others .

"so bitter is the weather that even the surface of the sea freezes solid . with more engaging material , this approach could have worked , but the remote and uninvolving script makes less for a movie than a cinematic tone poem . rickman and sharman macdonald created the script from macdonald's play , which was hopefully better than the motion picture adaptation . "" i can do what i like . i can gain weight if i like , and i can cut my own hair . "" ) both law and thompson appear to be following directions carefully in their acting , but neither character is well developed or worth caring about . michael kamen's hauntingly sad piano music and seamus mcgarvey's chillingly handsome cinematography fill the screen with beauty , but the movie itself is as cold as the frozen climate . the movie is so soporific that one begins to hope against hope that some misfortune will strike one of the players to stir up some genuine conflicts and emotions . instead , all we get is contrived and meaningless banter and inconsequential actions . if the dialog is deep and worth pondering , then saying little and doing less can succeed , but this story bogs down in petty disagreements . when a show works , it is easy to forgive major mistakes in its staging , but this dreadfully dull tale had me noticing them everywhere . consider just one aspect . the story goes to great lengths to remind the audience how cold it is -- the temperature being the film's chief metaphor . why then are there so many incongruities ? "" i don't where i was , "" chloe remarks at one point in the movie . "" i don't know who i am yet . "" with the actors' scenes edited out , we would be left with a lovely fifteen minute music video . that part is all that is worth seeing . it is rated r for brief nudity and a little profanity . the picture would be fine for teenagers .

"this is a come to your own conclusion movie , that might be a big let down if you were expecting to see the fable that is presented here come to a necessary resolution , but it is a film that gets better as you step away from it and realize how much intellectual weight there actually was in the telling of its austere story . whatever badii is searching for , this basically is still a philosophical movie , that asks people what is it that they want to get out of life and are they prepared to do something to ensure for themselves a happiness that hasn't been prescribed to them . it also indirectly asks the question , why would any one in good health and being sane , want to kill themselves . if i reply , help me out of the hole . if i don't , cover my body with 20 spadefuls of dirt . we don't really know the reason mr . badii wants to die and we know almost nothing about his personal life , except when he mentions to the poor seminarian he is trying to recruit for the job , that you don't know how someone else feels , you may be able to sympathize with them , but you could never understand their pain . but again , we can only guess at who he is and why he wants to commit suicide , to the director it is obviously not that important , or else he would have provided us with more information . he probably thought like i did , at first , that badii was a pervert trying to pick him up . again , the contrast between the men' silence and the noise from their work is explored . but he cannot do it for the reason that the moslem religion does not permit suicide , and badii's cogent argument , that sometimes by staying alive you do more harm to others than by dying , just falls on deaf ears . mr . bagheri ( baghieri ) is a turk , who talks incessantly , giving the film its lyrical voice it badly needed to counterpoint the tremendously impressive visual scope the film has so far counted on to give it its artistic touch , with its long shots of the barren mountain terrain the soldiers train on and where the workers spend their life on , and its close-ups on badii in his vehicle . then he asks badii , don't you want to taste the cherry ? don't you want to see the dawn and the beauty of the sunset , and the stars and the moon ? as he offers logical reasons for staying alive , that are indisputable . kiarostami' point is that all women are meant to be demeaned by such rigid laws of the state . films are meant to pose questions and not tell stories , is what the director is now telling us , since questions are more important to him , than anything else , they make us think harder about the things we do . my thought about the death of the linear film , as pronounced by the director , is that , if all you did was ask questions , as valuable as they are in the process of educating yourself , you would still end up being the idiot questioner , if that is all you did , question everything , because somewhere along the line , if you are honest with yourself , you will have to take a stand and state what it is you believe , and that statement might come across best in a linear story or some other film format , and not by posing more questions and becoming dogmatic about how a film should be made . why kiarostami might resort to this form of filmmaking , at least for this film , could have something to do with iran's repressive government and their long list of intolerances , that if he openly criticized them , it would probably result in no more kiarostami films for foreigners to adore . i'm a little reluctant to accept any one way of making films , as being the vade mecum of filmmaking , you just try to do what you can , if the film has a magic to it , it will work . i thought the ending of the film was not only a cop out , you don't know for sure if mr . badii committed suicide or not , but it also took the air out of the story's power and made it seem like a tease someone plays on you , first getting your hopes up and then going back on their word . kiarostami was having fun with the audience , and if you weren't in the mood for his jokes , then you might have thought like i did , that it was just too contrived and took away a very good experience i was having , with my imagination working on all cylinders , stimulated by the complexity of the problems raised ; and , by ending the film on that false note , and shooting it on video instead of film , it made it seem to me as if this was not a totally-serious attempt to look at ourselves and the society we live in , as i originally thought it was . if kiarostami thought i needed a break at that point of the film , that i was forgetting that it was just a film i was seeing , then he miscalculated how i felt . but i still believe the film had a potent political message that was delivered subterraneously , a message that is meant to shake us out of the habitual way we look at life ( and at film ) , and fail to recognize how important our dreamworld really is to us . and , in any case , i know from my past experiences with great filmmakers , that sometimes i don't like what i see from them the first time and later on change my mind and see more clearly what they were doing . so i'll leave open the option that my distaste for the film's ending will be subject to change , that is , if that is meant to be so .

"it's been more than fifteen years since the release of john carpenter's halloween , and ten since wes craven's a nightmare on elm street arrived on the big screen . each , in its own way , was a top-of- the-line horror flick--a film that relied more on chills and thrills than on graphic displays of butchery . those movies had unique visions of what was required to scare an audience , and neither resorted to the pointless and grotesque displays of gratuitous gore that permeated the other  big  entry of the time ( friday the 13th ) . but then came the inevitable sequels , and the corresponding plummet in quality . making a cheap buck took precedence over everything--including telling a good story . halloween 2 was steeped in blood . nightmare 2 , not directed by wes craven , lacked even a coherent story . by the end of the '80s , it was difficult to discern much difference between the various screen bogeymen : jason , michael , and freddy . it was still gore-happy , but its baddie , freddy , had a self-deprecating sense of humor ( his one-liners reminded one of the kinds of things that arnold schwarzenegger was wont to spout ) . by the fifth nightmare sequel , the films had become self- parodies . so why do another nightmare movie ? probably , as new line cinema exec robert shaye puts it ( in a cameo in this new entry ) , because the public wants it . the freddy krueger mask is still a pretty hot seller in halloween costume stores . perhaps the best turn of events is the return of wes craven , directing a nightmare for the first time since the original . he has returned a sense of genuine horror to the series , in part by taking it to completely new ground , and in part by giving his actors a legitimate script to work with . for his part , craven ( who also appears in the film ) is writing a new script ( which turns out to be the screenplay for this picture ) . those who can accept the basic premise are likely to have nearly as much fun . this isn't quite cinema verite , but at its most clever , it comes close--a sort of big-budget , horror version of my life's in turnaround . the only argument against craven's vision is that he perhaps didn't push the envelope far enough . the visual and gore effects , while not ilm top-of- the-line , are believable and occasionally downright chilling . the entire production is steeped in an unsettling atmosphere . the cinematic horror genre , like the science fiction one , has been badly hamstrung by poor films , and several of the nightmare on elm street entries have been at the forefront of the decline . therefore , it's somewhat ironic that one of the most intelligent and creative efforts to come along in a while bears the nightmare theme , title , and signature villain . any copycat features spawned by this movie will hopefully take a cue from wes craven's new nightmare and favor quality of scares over quantity of blood .

"camp stories manages the extremely difficult task of making 1993's dumb comedy-drama indian summer look intelligent , thoughtful , and original . this inept coming-of-age story is easily the worst camp film ever filmed -- and i'm not forgetting about the abysmal meatballs series . at least those movies never made a pretense of being anything other than bad . camp stories seems to think that having a moral makes it somehow worthwhile , when , in fact , it's close to unwatchable . and i'm not sure who the intended audience is : viewers under twelve will be bored out their minds ; viewers over that age would need a frontal lobotomy not to be insulted by what passes for a plot . like any true film buff , he doesn't mind viewing from here to eternity several dozen times . not only is the plot muddled and paced worse than a snail race , it's essentially one lame cliche piled atop of another . nothing in this story is remotely interesting , especially since it's child's play to guess everything that's going to happen . and the poor writing isn't just limited to plot details -- the dialogue is stilted and insipid . it's hard to believe that any actor would be caught dead saying some of these lines . then again , most of these actors give performances worthy of a corpse . the only one who's even adequate is zachary taylor . everyone else , from recognizable names like elliot gould to no-namers like kris park , either shows no evidence of acting talent or doesn't care enough to do more than what's required to take home a paycheck . it's embarrassing to watch these performers stumble through their one- dimensional roles . there are other problems with camp stories , including the music and cinematography , both of which border on awful . in fact , there's nothing that this film does even remotely well . herbert beigel probably had good intentions -- tell a story about being true to oneself -- but the execution is unspeakably poor . at one point , david comments that his life is  like a bad movie .  unfortunately , we don't need him to tell us what's perfectly obvious .

"men in black , the new science fiction comedy from cinematographer-turned-director barry sonnenfeld ( get shorty ) , postulates that such stories are not the result of fertile imaginations , but accurate representations of the truth . men in black is will smith's second consecutive motion picture close encounter of the third kind . in many ways , men in black is the movie that mars attacks ! wanted to be , but wasn't . this is a snappy , clever , often-funny motion picture that provides the perfect blend of science fiction-style action with comic dialogue . the screenplay , credited to ed solomon ( and based on the marvel comic book by lowell cunningham ) has a sly , sophisticated edge that many blockbuster scripts lack . sonnenfeld's direction is crisp and the editing is tight , resulting in a film that clocks in at a mere ninety-five minutes , which proves to be a nearly-perfect length . that's not to say that the movie is of masterpiece status , or even light on flaws . there are plenty of minor problems along the way , and the ending is somewhat rushed and anticlimactic . on the whole , however , viewers are less likely to remember the glitches than the clever one- liners , subtle parodies , and effective use of visual effects to integrate aliens into everyday existence . men in black's deliciously unconventional spirit lends a refreshing twist to a premise that has fueled numerous conspiracy theory movies and one currently-popular television series . smith and jones are a fine pair , and the film's focus on them never wavers . however , while the two leads can't complain about screen-time , the supporting players have all been short-changed . linda fiorentino , who gets third billing , is vastly underused , appearing only peripherally throughout . a word of caution for those who expect to see independence day 2 : despite the attempts of certain marketing campaigns to link the two , they're vastly different in scope and intent . men in black is an outright comedy ( in fact , some of its satire is directed at movies like last year's box office champ ) , not a pastiche of worn sci-fi/adventure elements , and there's no big space battle to be found . in fact , from the opening credits to the closing ones , our heroes stay firmly rooted on terra firma . those accepting men in black for what it is will likely agree that this is one of 1997's more satisfying big-budget offerings .

"the first thing to notice about john duigan's lawn dogs is the astounding performance of newcomer mischa barton , who plays devon , the 10-year old protagonist . barton is a natural actress , and manages to convey the perfect blend of maturity and innocence necessary for us to accept her character as something more vital than the construct of an uneven plot . theirs is basically a friendship between outsiders , and , although there is an undeniable sexual undercurrent inherent in their interaction , it's kept subtle , and duigan never exploits it . this is no lolita ; these two have a great deal in common on an emotional level , but neither is interested in entering into a physical relationship . sadly , barton's standout performance and the core relationship are really the only two worthwhile aspects of lawn dogs , a film that never quite gels into a satisfying whole . the problem is twofold . the plot is unwieldy and peppered with familiar , melodramatic moments . worse , the supporting characters are all pure caricatures . the plentiful attempts at satirizing the suburban lifestyle consistently strike a wrong note , often seeming cruel , uncomfortable , or out-of-synch . all other elements of the film are disappointingly banal . sitting through lawn dogs is like watching two entwined movies of vastly different quality . one is a well-written , atypical buddy story . the film expends enough effort on the latter to mute the impact of the former , and the climactic sequence is an exercise in violent , predictable melodrama . while there are things to appreciate in lawn dogs , especially barton's performance , the film as a whole left me strangely unfulfilled .  my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down .  -- david puttnam ",2

"she has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in . but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here . in this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken . it is written by the director's brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie . the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls . this scene didn't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also . but i doubt that . the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets . the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film . the film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia . she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . the film's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings . bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity . julia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn't know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them . this is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being . and , after all is said and done , who's to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was !

"a run of the country starts off as a little , light , slice of life movie , but by the end develops into full blown tragedy . his costumes and make up are reminiscent of a beggar in a dickens play . this character is badly written ( shane connaughton ) and poorly acted . without him the movie would have been much stronger . its been done a thousand times before and connaughton's writing provides nothing fresh . eventually , yates starts to provide focus and the movie comes into its own after meandering for about 20 minutes with a fairly boring , semi-slapstick tone . i was surprised how quickly my opinion began to change from boredom to being drawn into the story . smurfit is a first time movie actress that has a smile and a sense of inner confidence that mesmerizes her audience . suddenly you care , because you want to be danny . at this point , i thought the movie was going to be a romance . although the romance was wonderful and lasted for quite some time , the film is ultimately a tragedy that may make tears come to your eyes . from the first , where annagh declares that  you know our bodies are just bags of fluid and bones . i don't think we have a long term future on this planet  , you begin to sense an impending doom . there is also a little mystery along the way , but the writer telegraphs his punches so well that most of the audience knows who it is . for me the war part is an unnecessary complication , but i liked almost all of the show . my main criticism , other than the coco character , is that i wish yates had gone for either romance or tragedy , but not both . it was almost like a two part opera where the first act is all sweetness and light and the second all dark and foreboding . nevertheless , i liked both parts . the movie has fairly uninvolving cinematography which is a shame given the material they have to work with . the sound effects editing was especially good . it is rated r for a little violence , some tasteful and beautifully done sex , and some male and female nudity . it is a soft r , and i think it would be fine for teenagers . i recommend the movie to you , and i award it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : october 4 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"it is a biopic that is brutally honest about the exiled writer as an opponent of castro's , one that lets us see that liberation to him was not only a matter of politics but of the freedom to be a homosexual and an artist , something which the castro regime couldn't agree with and came down harshly on both homosexuals and artists , by sending them to prison camps . his happiest moments in childhood seemed to be watching the nude men bathing and those moments connected with nature , such as his love for the landscape and the ocean . spanish actor javier bardem portrays arenas ( someone he closely resembles ) with great sexuality , perception and feeling , giving a virtuoso performance . castro will allow for no artistic freedom or homosexual activity , which he labels counterrevolutionary . julian schnabel has created an emotionally penetrating look at a man living with his alienation in a marginalized existence and using that bitter experience as a source of energy for his writing . this beautifully photographed film , which looks much like a series of paintings on canvas , might be too bleak for a general audience , but it paints a more realistic political view of castro's cuba than most of the recent films i have seen about this subject , and should be of special interests to those of all persuasions who care about freedom and the arts .

"as the old adage goes , be careful what you wish for lest you get it and , by implication , loathe it . starring macaulay culkin in his first big role , the movie was a hit for its slapstick humor as well as the age-old theme of a kid who bests the grown-ups .

"most science fiction movies , good or bad , have a single look and set of characters that they use throughout the entire production . but not luc besson's the fifth element . every five minutes , some totally new character or special effect is introduced . this makes for a highly involving and mesmerizing film . although the film is incorrectly being marketed as the  star wars for the 90s ,  it does have some of the imagination of the star wars saga . where it differs , is that the fifth element never takes itself very seriously . the current trend among filmmakers is to engage in a battle with the studio's finance department with the filmmakers' goal being to spend the maximum amount possible on special effects . the fifth element puts some sanity in this trend by spending every penny wisely , producing some of the most dazzling effects in a long time . if you are envisioning a depressing blade runner motif for besson's vision , think again . typical of the innovativeness is its rendering of traffic in a big city in the year 2259 . rather than heavy traffic on the one street level , the airborne cars operate on numerous but carefully controlled parallel logical surfaces . among all of the visual spectacles is a story and some excellent acting as well . bruce willis , who can be terrific but has been in so many dogs like color of night that i have begun to dread seeing his name on the marquee , plays the starring role of the taxi driver and ex-government agent korben dallas . she speaks only a sing-song style of language that baffles korben . the screenplay by luc besson and robert mark kamen has enough complexity to make following it somewhat of a challenge , but never so much as to lose the audience . working through it becomes an interesting diversion , but all eyes stay glued to the screen to see what will happen next . the fifth element is more a feast for the eyes than the mind . the film is filled with cartoonish shoot-'em-up violence , willis , as one of many shooters , plays a much more lovable character than he does in the die hard series . his enjoyment of his character transfers easily to the audience . the chemistry between korben and his sidekick leeloo pulsates with comedic and romantic energy . me protect you .  ) with her quirky mannerisms and speech , jovovich steals most of her scenes . all of the details , right down to the barbecuing of the ugly little parasites on the spacecraft before the flight , are carefully orchestrated with maximum imagination . i believe it . the result overflows with energy and creativity . the fifth element runs 2 : 07 and is worth every minute . it is rated pg-13 for brief female nudity , cartoonish violence , and a little profanity . the film would be fine for kids say 9 or 10 and up . i had great fun at the fifth element so i recommend it to you strongly and give it * * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : may 6 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"it is a pretentious arty film set in 1929 , which failed to be credible or involving . the story was emotionally flat and the contrived ending was ludicrous ( this was not the same ending in the novel ) . dalloway ) tried to say in this merchant-ivory styled literary film . it was a drawn out glossy affair stuffed with empty gestures to the arts , and i could never figure out what john turturro was trying to do with his role as the chess genius , who is both a social misfit and someone who is mentally unstable , except to ham it up by acting over-the-edge . there just never seemed to be any point or excitement to this film , as adapted by screenwriter peter berry from vladimir nabokov's ironic novel . this film is devoid of nabkov's wit and irony , it reminded me only of a film that was concerned with showing a pretty face , some pretty scenery to look at , and eschewing any controversy . the film was devoid of any fascist's presence , even though mussolini had come to power in the early part of the 1920s , so even the period film's background history is distorted . these flashbacks were an attempt at making crass amateur psychological explanations for luzhin's emotional unstability due to his wretched upbringing . these scenes are conventional and added little meaning to luzhin's personal dilemma . everything about luzhin seems heavy-handed and done only for effect and not to develop his character . whatever happens to him seemed overwrought and artificial . his over-acting and the way the film tried to make this unfeeling love affair into a real one , had a disingenous feel to it . this film felt heavy at all times , like it was load of manure being dumped on a story that deserved a better fate than this film was able to give it .

"she , in fact , looks a lot like the director . so we can guess that some of these horrible experiences are something that might have happened to him in puberty . this loner theme is belabored and beaten into the story , so much so , that the obvious couldn't be made more obvious . there are no subtle messages . there is , also , no revenge of the nerd , or any analytical probes into what she can do about her low self-esteem ( and i am most grateful for that ) . this is simply a film that looks at why schools and families , for the most part , impart no concern about  culture  in the children they teach and raise , and why they can't respond with civility and intelligence to those students who need the most help that they can get . and the response is given so bluntly :  because you are so ugly .  he acts more like he was an adult than a teenager , even the rock band he starts , is not a rebellious one , but he does it because it will look good on his resume for college . in any case , whatever she does seems pathetic , and even though she is very smart , she does not do well in school . since the film sinks or swims , depending on how credible heather is in depicting this unhappy youngster with her vulnerabilities , it is safe to say that she fitted the role perfectly . there was no place to go in developing heather's character by adding these major societal problems to heather's story , that's for another film . solondz knows his subject well , he is able to understand and convey what it is to be brought up with self-hatred and how such people can react by being sometimes just as cruel as the society they are a product of , and the result is an unusual movie that focuses in on a subject very few filmmakers have chosen to do .

"the quirky duo who hung around in the background of kevin smith's 1994 debut feature , clerks , have returned to the screen for the followup , mallrats , the middle picture of the so-called  new jersey trilogy .  in many ways , this new movie is a less original , not-as-funny , full color redressing of clerks . despite a broad range of effective comedy and a decent laugh-per-minute ratio , mallrats is likely to be a moderate disappointment for anyone who guffawed their way through the previous film . their role here is a little more prominent than in their previous outing , and about half of mallrats' best humor is centered around them . they're involved in quite a bit of road runner/wylie coyote slapstick which , while obviously juvenile , is still hilarious . the script for mallrats is rather disjointed and episodic . although smith's knack for insightful comic dialogue is much in evidence , many of the lines aren't the equal of those in clerks for cleverness or humor . and , the less funny the dialogue is , the more stilted and unnatural it seems . there are several painfully awkward  dead spots  in mallrats where nothing works--not the dialogue , the acting , or the direction . pop references abound with as much regularity as the jokes ( sometimes they are the jokes ) . these range from nods to classic movies ( sundance in butch cassidy and the sundance kid ) , star wars , and '80s teen farces ( such as those directed by john hughes ) to comic book characters ,  the dating game  , and ( inevitably , given shannen doherty's presence ) a certain current tv show with a zip code in the title . smith is aware that there is a niche audience for mallrats--the under-30 crowd . as a result , the film plays almost exclusively to this group , and comes across as a grungy , male version of clueless . there is such a thing as the  sophomore jinx  for film makers . smith freely admits that he toned down the script and broadened the comedy in a quest for wider appeal , and allows that mallrats is a far less  cerebral  film than clerks . time , of course , will tell , but as long as jay and silent bob are around , future efforts can't be all that bad--or , for that matter , all that deep .

"screenplay : quentin tarantino , based on the novel  rum punch  by elmore leonard . producer : lawrence bender . director : quentin tarantino . a lot of those same folks are going to see jackie brown as a validation of their suspicions . after all , it's not the kind of dizzying , heart-stopping morality-play-disguised-as-nihilism pulp fiction was . both fans and foes of tarantino tend to fixate on his writing , but jackie brown may prove once and for all that the man is a remarkably talented film director . he does things with his camera that keep viewers off-balance , while avoiding the swooping ostentation of many young film-makers . at times , he will linger on a shot just after a character has moved out of frame ; at other times , he may shoot a conversation from behind the characters' backs . in one hilariously perfect scene , he uses complete darkness to build tension , complemented by an expertly handled split-screen to deliver the punch line . he directs a scene with such confidence that he can convince a viewer to follow wherever he's leading , because it always seems to be somewhere slightly unexpected . he's also got a gift for directing actors most directors will never have . in jackie brown , tarantino resurrects the careers of not one , but two forgotten actors of the 1970s . grier does fine work , but it's robert forster who breaks out of jackie brown with a superb performance . a veteran of b-grade cop shows like  nakia  and  banyon ,  forster plays the world-weary cherry with natural charisma and a touching affection for jackie . in a cast full of heavy hitters like samuel l . jackson and robert deniro ( both of whom are also top-notch ) , grier and forster make an unexpected romance between two people past their hollywood-pretty prime funny , sexy and convincing . it's true that jackie brown includes plenty of familiar elements from previous tarantino efforts : bursts of unpredictable violence , twelve-letter profanities by the truck-load , non-linear narrative , creative use of old songs ( doing for  strawberry letter #23  what reservoir dogs did for  stuck in the middle with you  ) . it's also true that jackie brown moves at the kind of measured pace which could have some tarantino fans tapping their toes with impatience . it's not an instant classic , just a sharp piece of entertainment with the kind of tightly-structured script you wish tarantino could teach to other writers . i found it hard not to smile virtually from start to finish in jackie brown -- not because it's constantly amusing , but because it's such a pleasure to be in the hands of someone who knows how to use the medium . even if it's an over-rated , plagiarizing flavor of the month like quentin tarantino . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line  subscribe  .

"you see , this mr . perfect turns out to be a madman . he exhibits signs of being a control freak , someone who might even be a nut case , by taking everything so literal and acting in a robotic and deliberate fashion when he speaks , so that everything he does seems out of place . in fact , the acting in the film by everyone is really fine , especially considering how thin the script was . it is the story itself and the way it is directed that leads to the detriment of the film , allowing it to have the look of one of those films made only to be seen as a rental video , which indeed is how this film was released . the film tries to play like noir , but only ends up being the kind of fake noir that is more irritating than complimentary . it tries to be purposefully evasive about its storyline and to have its tenuous story be based on chance as being the sole determinant of life . what it eventually becomes is a predictable psycho flick and not an unpredictable noir film , as it wanted to be . it has trapped itself into being a film without a plot , with rotten dialogue , and a fake means of maintaining tension . it tries so hard to give itself a weird angle through its characterizations , which only work on a superficial level-from the neurotic damsel-in-peril , plummer- to the split personality performance of forster , whose actions waiver between maniacally calm reasoning to histrionic schmaltz , as he goes off the deep end reciting rhymes . the main problem , which the film is never able to overcome , is that the storyline is not that compelling and that the characters are not necessarily interesting even if they are quirky . the story never had a real strength to it ; it always seemed like the actors were play-acting , that the script was struggling to device another gimmick to go with the coin toss motif , instead of letting the story seem to come about out of its own accord . this did not help explore anything going on inside the characters , only trivializing the story further , making it rely solely on a gimmick to tell its story . what we are left with is a series of encounters among characters who are not that appealing in the first place , and also by the end of the film , we know only a little more about the psychopath than we did from the opening scene . i therefore wasn't sure what the director wanted to accomplish , except he probably thought by showing how idiosyncratic all the characters could be , that would be enough to get it over . if that was what he was thinking , he misjudged the quality of the film , but not before he showed flashes of talent here and there , for example , in the opening scene in the desert --- forster's calm demeanor was played-off beautifully against plummer's nervous energy , and with the desert lurking as a hostile backdrop to the action , it added a thrilling surreal sense of dramatics to the story . but the film fell too quickly into the serial-killer mode , and lost the edge it never had but always wanted .

"i'm a firm believer in film critics admitting their biases , especially when it may not be obvious . let me start by confessing that ; as a native texan , i have always had a special place in my heart for armadillos , a waddling sherman tank of an animal that looks like a possum with body armor . ever since they took to invading my outdoor chapel service when i was a boy at camp , i've loved those little critters . in mark illsley's happy , texas , written with great glee by the director and ed stone , an armadillo gets some revenge on its most common predator , the automobile . the entire picture is marvelously cast but none is better than veteran supporting actor william h . macy ( academy award winner for fargo ) as the in-the-closet gay , sheriff dent . in a marvelously silly bit of physical comedy , wayne screams at the girls and tries to show them how to sing and dance . he's a doofus disaster at first , but , of course , he'll get better , which he manages to make as prissily fun as when he is bad . one of the best subplots in a wonderful romp of a film concerns the moves that chappy puts on harry . ordering a steak , chappy tells the waiter ,  i want the rarest steak you've got -- just dehorn it , wipe its butt and send it in .  nope . if you don't feel that you've gotten your money's worth from a picture unless you can leave the theater saddened by the gravity of the depressing situations , and if your favorite films all have unhappy endings , then happy , texas may leave you with an uncomfortably happy feeling . but for those of us that could use a little mirth in our lives , the good-spirited happy , texas with its silly script and adorable antics is just what we need . it is rated pg-13 for language , sexual content and some violence and would be fine for kids around 12 and up .

"screenplay : robert benigni and vincenzo cerami . producers : elda ferri and gianluigi braschi . director : roberto benigni mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes ) running time : 114 minutes . life is beautiful , a fancifully dark italian comedy from co-writer/director/star roberto benigni , has inspired one of the most misguided criticisms of recent years . the criticism leveled at life is beautiful is that it is a sanitized version of the holocaust , which somehow diminishes the gravity of the tragedy by squeezing humor from it . the absurdity of that criticism is that it seems to miss the point entirely . benigni crafts a sensitive relationship between the father and son , as guido's wit and imagination allow him to create a world of pleasure and hope where no pleasure or hope should be possible . there are more than enough grim reminders of the camp's true purpose -- as well as a glimpse of banal evil in the character of an obliviously self-absorbed physician ( horst buchholz ) -- to dismiss any notion that benigni as a film-maker is candy-coating one of the bleakest chapters in human history . the irony of that misguided criticism is that there's a much simpler reason to be less than dazzled by life is beautiful -- namely , most of the first hour . in essence , it's an _extremely_ extended prologue , introducing us to guido as a carefree seeker of love and fortune who directs his creative energies towards winning dora's heart . the pleasant scenes between them certainly establish their bond , as well as guido's imaginative gifts , but on their own they're fairly innocuous bits of romantic tomfoolery . benigni mixes physical comedy with the occasional social commentary , all with moderate success and the sense that he's just passing time until he can get to the real meat of the story . it's easy to imagine benigni setting up all the necessary relationships in about half the time , making the shift in tone less abrupt . . . and making shifting in your seat less necessary . none of that detracts from the potent , bittersweet pleasures of the film's second half . all of the things that could have gone wrong instead go right -- the young cantarini radiates charming innocence without cloying self-awareness ; benigni hits just the right balance between clown and unlikely hero ; the darker moments always feel consistent with the human comedy . life is beautiful grows richer by the minute , making it easy to forgive the amiable but meandering first half . if it hadn't takeng quite so long to reach its most powerful scenes , life is beautiful would have been an easy choice as one of the year's best films . an expression as trite as  triumph of the human spirit  doesn't quite do justice to what benigni has pulled off here . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line  subscribe  .

"both are quite capable actors , but the parts they are given in happy together almost dares the audience to care . their lifeless performances are right in line with wong's dreadfully dull screenplay . although the movie contains some of the most graphic homosexual scenes i've encountered , the actors present no passion or love during them with the result that the scenes are coldly antiseptic . never is the narrative interesting and rarely are the characters the least bit compelling . the picture has a single saving grace . the cinematography by christopher doyle punctuates the otherwise uninvolving scenes with fascinating images . although doyle's work in happy together is not nearly as good as his stunning work in temptress moon , he enlivens an otherwise tedious picture . using both oversaturated black-and-white sequences and lush color ones , he keeps the audience's attention even when the story doesn't . similarly , the movie happy together has a dreary sameness to each of its vignettes , only the handsome cinematography saves it from being an unwatchable , boring film . the picture is in cantonese with chinese and english subtitles . the film is not rated but would get an r for nudity , profanity , violence and graphic sex . the film is not appropriate for teenagers .

"hollywood adaptations of plays rarely come off much worse than this b&w one did . there is no kind way to put it otherwise , or to say if only it did this or that the film could have been saved , nor is there reason to say , if the acting was better the film could have been bearable . the problem with the film starts firstly with the casting of the two main actors . whenever they were on screen the film was unwatchable . the first-time actress who was chosen as a result of a national talent search for a newcomer for the part , was won by the iowa teen-ager , jean seberg , who doesn't have whatever inner strength it takes to be joan of arc , at least she doesn't have it at this point of her career , and should have not been cast in that part ; her shrill voice does not make for a naive peasant girl who hears the voice of god , nor does the closing of her eyes portend that she is a visionary . richard widmark , who played the future king charles vii , the dauphin , as if he were jerry lewis in one of those stupid lewis and martin comedies of the 1950s , was not a good casting decision either . he appeared to be ridiculous emoting in his spastic gestures at the camera , as if he was in the wrong film and didn't understand that this one wasn't meant to be a comedy . the story had no emotional appeal or urgent power , and seemed like it was shot by a rank amateur filmmaker who had no idea how to get coherence from a scene and real passion from his performers , in a story that was supposedly all about passion , this one had none . it was an exercise in futility and arrogance on the part of the director , a thumbing his nose at anyone who disagrees that he is a great filmmaker and that he could make any type of film . it is no surprise that there was no audience for this film , that film critics roasted it , and that the ever-arrogant preminger sneered back at them in contempt . but if he wanted to know what joan was all about , he should have observed carl dreyer's masterpiece  the passion of joan of arc  ( 28 ) , and he would have seen the spiritual qualities the story was imbued with and realized that his version had failed to capture the power of the story and why the argument against the church in the story means so much to so many , and for such a long time the story poetically moved a people interested in those who have visions . that scene is my all-time favorite . it was unbelievable . its worth seeing the film just for that . with joan , all high-and-mighty on her steed , shouting out things like ,  i get my orders from god ,  this film was just too much of a brain-drainer . it was filmmaking at preminger's worst . well , if you're in joan's shoes , and you really believe you're tuned into god , you have no choice but to continue to listen to those voices in your head . what was a great actor like john doing here , and to the bargain , why was he wasted in such a small role ? maybe , if he could have played both joan and king charles this dog would have had legs ! but the film never made it seem like she was anything but a quack , committing herself to a self-imposed death , and she is always seen behaving irrationally . there was no justification for the story's outcome , no power in its presentment , and its style suffered from an ill-humor . preminger , takes a cue from one of the lines in the film , when joan says ,  i always know i'm right- because i hear the voices .

"starring : dustin hoffman , rene russo , morgan freeman , cuba gooding jr . , kevin spacey , donald sutherland . screenplay : laurence dworet and robert roy pool . director : wolfgang petersen . you've got to love it when hollywood producers find themselves scrambling to be the first out of the blocks with an idea . though its conventional action climax doesn't fulfill the promise of a gripping first hour , it's still a satisfying popcorn thriller . the first half of outbreak , which actually deals with the spread of the disease , is as tense an hour as i have spent at the movies in a long time . director wolfgang petersen makes some great decisions filming scenes like a tour through the army's medical facility , which moves ominously from labs studying relatively benign viruses to those studying the bad boys . there is also a wickedly funny moment when an infected man sneezes in a movie theater , and we watch particles flying through the air into other people's mouths . what eventually becomes clear is that petersen's direction is orders of magnitude better than the script from which he is working . the attempts at humor are frequently limp , the performances ( except those by space and gooding ) perfunctory and the characters of the standard , one-dimensional action film variety . and those aren't the only elements that warrant comparison to standard action films , as the conclusion becomes not a down-to-the-wire hunt for a cure in the lab , but a down-to-the-wire helicopter chase , or rather several down-to-the-wire helicopter chases . the sequences are exciting and well-filmed , but they don't belong in this movie any more than a u-boat battle would have belonged in schindler's list . i have a personal beef with outbreak as well , namely that it relies so much on government conspiracy theories . the prospect of a deadly disease wreaking havoc is powerful enough without resorting to paranoia-mongering , and i have yet to see much evidence that any really big secret can be kept in the talk show age , let alone for thirty years as is the case in outbreak . frankly , it's sloppy plotting , and indicative of outbreak's roots as part of a race to be first rather than best . for one hour , outbreak keeps the tension high , but petersen could have done much more with a script just a re-write or two more polished .

"the nightmare before christmas is a visual splendor . done on the cheap , this could have been a gimmicky , unsatisfying motion picture , but considering the obvious time and effort put into constructing the movie , it is an unqualified success . we are given a clever cast of characters that look like something from edward gorey's sketchbook in a setting that oozes atmosphere . it is not difficult at all to become wrapped up in this movie . the film is designed to be suitable for all but the youngest children , some of whom might be frightened by any of the bizarre inhabitants of halloween town ( you know your childrens' natures and whether animated ghouls and goblins will terrify them or not ) . on its surface , the story has little more complexity than the year without a santa claus , so younger viewers will be able to enjoy the movie without feeling lost or bored . however , as is too rarely the case with family films , there is another level to this film . much of the wryest humor is designed for adults . even those who aren't taken in by the charming-yet-simple story or the likable characters , will be enthralled by the world tim burton and director henry selick have created . it is , quite frankly , an amazing achievement , and one that we are not likely to see repeated for a long time . this is , remember , a family film . with the exception of one or two , these are uniformly lifeless , and there are times when the movie might have been better without them . something a little more energetic is called for . elfman's score is more than adequate , but the songs are lacking . the nightmare before christmas has something to offer just about everyone . for the kids , it's a fantasy celebrating two holidays . for the adults , it's an opportunity to experience some light entertainment while marvelling at how adept hollywood has become at these techniques . there are songs ( even if they aren't nearly as noteworthy as they should be ) , laughs , and a little romance . in short , the nightmare before christmas does what it intends to do : entertain .

"this movie , which could just as easily be called the michael jordan worship show , plays like a 90-minute homage to his airness , selling his every virtue . by the end of this picture , jordan , whose status as a pop icon has never been in dispute , has been elevated to the level of a demi-god . it was inevitable that jordan would eventually get into the movies . space jam's problem isn't that jordan is the star , but that the tone is sickeningly reverential . there are only a few times when space jam dares to poke fun at its leading man , and , on those occasions , it does so gently . opportunities for satire exist , but pytka pulls nearly every punch . the bland results lead to a movie whose entertainment value is fine for kids , but marginal for adults . on the other hand , any movie that features the delightful looney tunes characters can't be all bad , and , indeed , the writing for bugs bunny and friends is as crisp as ever ( except when they're bowing and genuflecting before his airness ) . just about everyone from the warner brothers cartoon world is there , from bugs and daffy to foghorn leghorn and marvin the martian . there's even a new character , lola bunny , who gives bugs a love interest and adds a little sex appeal to the otherwise all-male cartoon character roster . i wish there had been more of these two -- they were always the funniest the looney tunes had to offer . the story , which would like to follow in the footsteps of the groundbreaking who framed roger rabbit ? , mixes live-action and animation . technically , the film isn't quite up to roger rabbit's standards , but it's a huge improvement over ralph bakshi's cool world , which mingled gabriel byrne and brad pitt with a bunch of sleazy cartoon creations . certainly , from a visual standpoint , there's nothing wrong with space jam . in fact , a few sequences are positively dazzling . there are a number of exceptionally clever moments in space jam , some of which are visual and some of which lie in the dialogue . several of these pass quickly or occur in the background , so it takes a keen eye to spot them . a couple of the better , more obvious ones include a nod to pulp fiction and a biting dig at disney . aside from jordan , the only human with any significant screen time is wayne knight , who plays an irritating baseball publicist . strangely , however , amidst all the two- dimensional cartoon characters , the flattest figure of all is jordan . the basketball star's power might be the drawing card for space jam , but the looney tunes group steals the spotlight -- at least as often as pytka will let them .

"and , while i suppose there are some superficial similarities , those who are making such comparisons appear to be giving far too much credit to this film . the butcher boy works best as a dark comedy and social satire , and is somewhat less successful as a character study of a deeply-troubled young boy whose violent impulses are fed by his unstable environment . at first , we view francie as a fairly typical product of a dysfunctional home , but it soon becomes apparent that his problems run much deeper . most coming-of-age films are about kids triumphing by overcoming adversity . jordan presents the butcher boy as more of a black comedy than a tragedy . francie's internal monologues ( the film is infected with the dreaded voiceover narrative ) are sometimes corrosively funny , especially his descriptions of certain characters . by playing up the most absurd aspect of almost every situation , jordan manages to find the humor in even the most horrific sequences . in some ways , i was reminded of the recent film intimate relations , which possessed a similar , bizarre tone . without a doubt , jordan has a good sense of time and place , and uses it to the film's advantage . there's no debating that francie is a fascinating individual , or that newcomer eamonn owens gives an amazing performance , but this boy doesn't burrow under our skin in the same way that the two girls from heavenly creatures ( a not entirely dissimilar film ) do . we see francie's explosive rage clinically , from a distance . we do not experience or participate in it , and that keeps the butcher boy from being a truly memorable motion picture .  my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down .  -- david puttnam ",1
"screenplay : stanley tucci , joseph tropiano . running time : 108 minutes . it probably says as much about me as it does about big night that i consider it a remarkably insightful film about the state of contemporary film-making . however , i think big night is something particularly special for anyone who loves movies because of what they can be . it is a warm , engaging and extremely funny film which manages not simply to describe the battle between art and commerce , but to win it on behalf of the former . his own character of secondo is the film's central figure , but all three main characters are superbly written and acted . ian holm has a tasty , showy role as the unapologetically assimilated pascal , who runs his restaurant like a circus ; holm's accent is hit-and-miss , but his truly unprintable favorite epithet for secondo actually gets funnier every time he uses it . it is this conflict which makes big night such a potent metaphor for cinema in the 1990s . what big night ultimately argues is that somewhere along the line , you have to choose between doing the work you know will make you proud and doing the work you know will make you rich . there is room for both , tucci suggests , but the greatest satisfaction comes from people loving the best you had to give them . but whether you see big night as a simple tale of brotherly conflict and fine dining or as a meditation on art as a consumer product , you should see big night , because film-making simply doesn't get much more satisfying . tucci , scott and company have put together a banquet of finely drawn characters , smart dialogue and assured direction , culminating in an elaborate meal which might inspire you to the same conclusion which leads one character to utter one of the year's best punch lines . it also ends with a wordless single take in which resolution is achieved with such grace , simplicity and emotion that you could find yourself smiling all the way out the door .

"once were warriors , a new zealand export , is centered upon the touchy yet timely topic of domestic violence . it is not , however , merely another  domestic violence motion picture .  with its complex cultural backdrop and its stark view of this societal cancer , once were warriors attains a level where it is equally painful and potent . the critical themes of this movie are universal , even though there is a great deal of background that only a new zealander ( or a student of that country's history ) can appreciate . nevertheless , though many elements of the subtext may be lost to outside viewers , the key issue--the brutal cycle of violence and denial within a family--is brought to the fore in a manner that necessitates no special awareness . equality is not a basic tenant of the maori lifestyle , at least as depicted in this film . they gripe at each other , but all seems pretty tranquil , and there are moments of genuine affection . many films have depicted wife-beatings . few have been as graphic and difficult to watch . the acting throughout once were warriors is uniformly strong , with leading and supporting actors turning in performances that range from credible to electric . the musical score , by murray mcnabb , is evocative , and a perfect match for the drab , dreary colors suffusing stuart dryburgh's camerawork . great pains have been taken to emphasize that everyone in this film is trapped by one thing or another--if not their circumstances , then their personality . once were warriors works , to some degree , on three levels : the visceral , the emotional , and the intellectual , and it is the amalgamation of these that makes this a memorable film .

"in honor of my wife and my twenty-seventh wedding anniversary this past september the thirteenth , i am going to do something i've never done before . i am going to review a film i have not seen in ten years . since the true mark of a great movie is its ability to forever cast an indelible mark on our memory , reviewing a picture you haven't seen in a decade actually makes some sense . to this day , it is the only film i have seen more than four or five times . like trekies , we want to see the film constantly doing our courtship and could quote most of the lines . although i have long since lost count , i know the number of times we have seen the picture is between fifteen and twenty . we frequently would stay to see it twice in a row at the local mutliplex . a more romantic and realistic rendition of the nature of love , i have never seen . although the play  romeo and juliet  has been made into movies many times before and would be made again , no one has ever captured young love as zeffirelli did . first , the casting of two photogenic , talented , but unknown actors of the right age was the foundation upon which he created a masterpiece . with olivia hussey as juliet and leonard whiting as romeo he had the basic ingredients , but just having the right cast does not a masterpiece make . it only makes it possible . the only major actor was laurence olivier who was the narrator . all of the supporting cast were excellent , but pat heywood , john mcenery , milo o'shea , michael york were especially brilliant . mcenery's mercutio was a complex and bizarre reading that fit the spirit of the character perfectly . york's tybalt was excellent as a character not seeking a fight , but more than confident of his ability if forced by circumstances . it is interesting to note that only a few of these actors , including the stars , had much success after this film . when he presses juliet's hand at the dance , it is more erotic than many a scene today where the actors are all buck naked . finally , the balcony scene , which every student knows and probably thinks is trite , is made fresh in zeffirelli's capable hands . i liked the way zeffirelli handled this . he included it to show the reality of the situation , but editor reginald mills trimmed it down to just flash the scene on the screen before moving on . although it is clear from the beginning that this is a love affair that is destined for tragedy , when the tragedy does strike , the audience is crushed anyway . by the middle of the picture , it is impossible not to be in love with the two protagonists and thereby not want any harm to come to them . the ending is sad , but effective . this is the richest and most moving of any shakespeare play i have ever seen made for the screen , and as a critic , i have seen a lot of them . i can not leave this tribute to one of my absolute favorite pictures without mentioning a few of the outstanding technical aspects of the film . the lush and hazy cinematography by pasqualino de santis deservedly won the academy award that year . from the very first image , the audience is alerted that something special is about to unfold . the script by franco brusati , maestro d'amico , and franco zeffirelli is true to the play . brief sections of the play were removed to get the play down to the right length and pacing for a movie , but shakespeare's poetic language was not tampered with . the editing was flawless . the action sequences are full of energy , but never too choppy . the love scenes stay with the character perfectly . the academy award winning costumes by danilo donati are gorgeous . especially well done are the clothes worn at the dance and all of juliet's clothes . they are naturally lovely without being showy . finally , the music by nino rota is so memorable it leaves you with music and songs forever in your subconscious . i love the theme song and still hear it being played today . although i am sure i'll see it , it will probably feel like a sacrilege to this fan of zeffirelli's version . as always as a critic , i'll try to keep an open mind . it is not rated , but would probably get a pg today for the extremely brief nude scene and for the tragic theme . there is no sex or bad language . the picture would be fine for any kid old enough to be interested which is probably eight and up . i give this picture my strongest recommendation and my highest rating of * * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"but , in the contender , the extremely impressive second feature film by writer and director rod lurie ( deterrence ) , there is at least one politician for whom principles are more important than politics , even if her integrity costs her the honor of being the nation's first female vice president . speaking of honors , expect to see this political thriller and morality tale garner many well deserved oscar nominations including , but not limited to , best actress ( joan allen ) and best supporting actor ( gary oldman ) .  principles only mean something if you stick to them when it's inconvenient ,  she explains with utter sincerity . allen , in a consistently strong performance , never lets senator hanson dissolve into self-righteousness . she gives a sympathetic performance that doesn't require sympathy to admire . but it's more than that . the sharply written script mixes heavy drama with sweet comedy . it's a great life , and he's making the most of it . bridges's charismatic performance is full of nuances and subtlety that leaves us never quite sure of his motivations . surprisingly , the president brushes his candidacy aside , claiming that someone might decide that his heroism was actually another chappaquidick episode . the congressman is at once utterly polite and completely devious . no matter how unlikable runyon becomes , oldman never lets him dissolve into caricature . she wants to talk nothing but policy at her hearings -- the usual liberal litany of ban all handguns , abolish the death penalty and guarantee a woman's right to choose . all of the casting in this ensemble effort is terrific . lurie's staging is masterful , even if sometimes a bit over the top . the beauty of the story is that we keep waiting for more shoes to drop . some of them do , but others we expect to , don't . and still others drop , but turn out not to be what we expect . my only complaint is that one key twist is needlessly telegraphed . the movie itself is no enigma . its principles are crystal clear and dramatically demonstrated . the contender is all the president's men for our time . it is rated r for strong sexual content and language and would be fine for most teenagers .

"and the corollary to this rule , in the case of time regained ( le temps retrouv ? ) , is that if you haven't read the seven volume set of novels called  remembrance of things past  by marcel proust , the movie will probably be completely impenetrable . ( actually , i'm not so sure that those who have read the full set will be able to follow time regained , written and directed by ra ? l ruiz , but i'm willing to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that anyone who has invested the time to read the entire seven volume set will love the film . maybe this explains why well-respected critics have differed so widely on their evaluation of the film , with some giving it their absolute best rating and others their absolute worst . at any rate , this review will apply only to those who haven't read the books . ) watching these snippets feels like one is seeing a twenty-plus episode soap opera which some maniacal editor has hacked up and reassembled into something one tenth of the original size . the result is a confusing and obtuse mess . the collage of clips leaves us with many questions , chief among them : who are all of these characters ? how does this scene fit in with any of the other scenes ? and why should we care ? the more time and energy we devote to the story , the less we care . only the production has much to offer . some scenes are like beautifully faded picture postcards from a bygone era . as the music comes up , others appear to be the introduction to grand opera , except that the diva never quite breaks into her aria . finally , many scenes appear to be something out of a peter sellers comedy in which all of the funny lines have been removed . the movie has a strong cast , including catherine deneuve and emmanuelle b ? art . the less said , however , about john malkovich's performance as a sadomasochistic baron , the better . the movie is not without its treats . time regained runs an extremely long 2 : 35 . the film is in french with english subtitles . it is not rated but might be pg-13 for adult themes and would be acceptable for teenagers .

"this is a film where the heroine could say with deep conviction that  i've seen bodies shining like stars ,  and we believe her without laughing at her . it's an unusual and fascinatingly compelling fairy tale type of drama , steeped in feeling and intellect and romance .  kissed  is based on the original story by barbara gowdy  we so seldom look on love ,  and directed with economy in her first feature by canadian lynne stopkewich . what makes this film standout , is that the subject matter is necrophilia . this is never followed up . but for sandra the dead bodies are a means of transcendence . . . the reason it's a detriment , is because her story is more dynamic and compelling than his . one of the really amazing things about ths film is that it's all believable . it's handled in a romantic and even comical way , allowing us to see the characters for what they are instead of sensationalizing their fetishes . there were three very good performances : jay brazeau sets a sobering tone for the story to be grounded in reality , no matter how far-fetched it may seem . peter outerbridge brings a sensitivity and restlessness to his role , as someone whose curiosity is so great that he's willing to try something that is ghoulish . but the film belongs to molly parker's absorbing translation of her role , as an ordinary person who is compelled to do what she feels most pressing inside her . the film comes with voice-overs from molly , in her quiet , gentle voice , and the photography at times becomes glowing in a heavenly whiteness or darkly pressing in a sobering blue shade . the film always felt dreamlike , like it was a fairy tale without a moral lesson to it . the film's only fault is in how slight the story is and how it failed to go beyond the shocking taboo point of its  crossing over  theme and really explore that untested subject matter in more depth . but the film is still a special one because of the freshness of its ideas , the originality of the film's theme , and the way it was so artfully filmed .

"given how much i loved and was enchanted by like water for chocolate , i went to see a walk in the clouds with much excitement . the same director ( alfonso arau ) and the same cinematographer ( emmanuel lubezki ) did both pictures so my expectations were not unrealistic . both pictures have a look and a beauty that is almost unsurpassed , but more on that later . the aragons live in great spender in the napa valley where the movie was actually filmed . the ethnic heritage and their great wealth made me think of the gallo family albeit the gallos are italian-americans . this continuing family banter followed by brief scenes between paul and victoria is what the movie is all about . okay , let's cut to the chase . this movie was a huge disappointment for me . keanu reeves for all of his terrific looks can do only one thing well , action films . he was super in speed , and that is about it . he was pathetic in much ado about nothing and in little buddha . her again , he proves he needs more acting lessons and less modeling ones . the biggest problem in the movie is that there is no chemistry between the two stars . it is as if they are speaking to separate walls rather than to each other . unlike like water for chocolate , there is no magic here . i tried as hard as i could to like this movie , but other than the scenic beauty , it is like a meringue . there is nothing there when you bite into it . alberto sums up the problem with the movie when he says  there is something wrong here . the whole thing is wrong .  finally , the ending is ridiculous and worthy of someone who blessed the world with the realism and the wisdom of the karade kid movies . although it was hard to tell given the lines she was given , i believe that aitana sanchez-gijon has a lot of potential . she is certainly one of the most beautiful new actresses i have seen lately . you become obsessed with leaving your seat in the theater and jumping in . going to this movie is not a waste . this movie deserves at least an academy award nomination for cinematography and another for set design ( david gropman ) . the look of the yellow and greens of the leaves , the golden amber of sunsets on everything , and the constant backlighting of all of the characters are all worthy of monet . i could go on and on about how gorgeous this picture is . you have to see this scene to grasp its serenity and beauty . the infrequent black and white flashbacks and flashforwards provide an effective contrast . visually , not some , but every scene is a masterpiece . the music ( leo brower ) is quite dramatic and fits the mood of the show and the images very well . a walk in the clouds runs too long at 1 : 45 thanks to poor pacing and a lack of stronger editing by don zimmerman . the movie is rated pg-13 since it is an adult drama i guess . it is a mild pg-13 since there is no profanity that i can remember , no violence , no nudity , and no sex . any kid older than 9 should be able to see this show with no problems . on the other hand , i recommend this show only to people studying cinematographic techniques . for others , you are liable to leave the show bored and disappointed , and i recommend you pass on it . i give the movie * 1/2 only for the academy award quality cinematography . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : august 11 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 104 minutes . albert brooks is a rather odd case as a film-maker . on the one hand , he goes years between projects , has loyal and generally intelligent fans and never has had a really big commercial success . brooks is like a hybrid of woody allen and ivan reitman , a writer/director too smart and eccentric to get maximum mileage out of his marketing-friendly plots . mother is a perfect example of brooks' nose for high-concept , but for once he doesn't work any particular magic with it . riding on the familiarity of his situations and a wicked performance by debbie reynolds , brooks turns out an amusing but uneven domestic comedy . john determines that all of his failed relationships have had certain elements in common , and that those elements might be traceable to his upbringing . much of the appeal of mother -- most of the appeal , to be frank -- comes from the character of beatrice henderson , less as created by brooks than as realized by reynolds . there are moments when brooks verges on condescension towards his older female characters -- an encounter with neighbors in a grocery store is both funny and rather embarrassing -- but debbie reynolds salvages every one by giving her line readings an intelligent twist . even when beatrice is fumbling with technology or circling a parking lot past the one available space , she never comes off as dim or pathetic . with a professionalism showing no signs of rust after a long layoff from screen acting , reynolds wrestles a laundry list of motherly quirks into a wonderful character . this achievement comes almost in spite of brooks' script , which has plenty of funny lines but too little narrative direction . the goodwill generated by the main premise carries mother a surprisingly long way , but brooks doesn't do all that much with it . the film is full of situations with great comic potential , most of which inspire a chuckle and little more because brooks prefers wry observation to outrageousness . it is a scene which primes you for a huge laugh -- a man , his mother , lingerie . . . can you feel the giddy tension rising ? -- then dissolves after yet another good-natured chuckle . mother is full of moments , like a scene where john channel-surfs through a succession of info-mercials , where brooks seems to be waiting for a punch line to formulate itself instead of attacking the set-up to provide a payoff . mother is almost always an entertaining film , but it is not nearly as subversive as it could have been , or as flirting with disaster was covering similar ground of warped familial relations . perhaps the problem is that the script does not launch itself from full , rich characterizations . in fact , as the story unfolds , it seems that brooks has constructed his story around psychological case studies rather than people . every time mother does something exasperating , john deconstructs it in search of its deeper significance . the result is frustrating , as though brooks were telling jokes then stopping after each one to explain why it was just as sad as it was funny . it is one of the characteristics which makes brooks unique as a film-maker that he builds his climax around a moment of insight rather than a wacky car chase , but there has to be a middle ground . debbie reynolds takes mother's high-concept and gives it high energy , making it a film anyone who has had a mother could like , but perhaps only a mother could love .

"apparently , the producers of jumanji wanted this film to be a jurassic park for 1995's holiday season . if so , it's a badly misplaced , and ultimately futile , hope . for , although no one would suspect steven spielberg's 1993 dino-picture of having a plot worthy of great literature , at least it had a storyline -- something this film is lacking . the result isn't much more fun or involving than watching a few friends play monopoly . even the robin williams manic humor can't save jumanji , at least not entirely . the film's biggest claim to fame are its special effects . unfortunately , they don't look as impressive in extended scenes on the big screen as they do in short clips on tv . in fact , there are times when the sequences of charging rhinos , elephants , and zebras look downright cheesy . the monkeys certainly aren't convincing and the little shop of horrors audrey ii-type man-eating plant would have been more effective had it broken into a song . jurassic park showed how amazing computer-generated creatures can be when properly handled ; jumanji shows what happens when less care is given to the technology . then , when it's peter's turn , alan mysteriously re-appears , much older and looking suspiciously like robin williams with a lot of excess facial hair . the movie goes something like this : someone makes a move , then the characters spend the next ten minutes running away from whatever animals they unleash . then it's the next player's turn . and so on . . . jumanji comes across more as a blueprint for some deluxe amusement park ride than a legitimate film . it's a pointless trek . the  adventure  is repetitive , he thrills are brief , and the moments of character-building drama are effete . only the comedy works , but there's not enough of it to justify an entire motion picture . this is the kind of embarrassing dud that results when hollywood places special effects and a neat concept over a well-told story . the children's book jumanji , written by chris van allsburg , makes for good reading for a young audience , but it's hardly the sort of material upon which to base a major motion picture .

"for it's 15th anniversary , jonathan demme's classic concert film stop making sense is being re-released with a new print and a remastered dolby digital soundtrack . starring david byrne as well as the other members of the talking heads , the film is certain to delight their fans . with minimalist staging , lighting and camerawork , the concert documentary may have a more limited appeal for those who aren't fond of byrne's strident singing style . older movies with large cult followings are some of the hardest films to review . people have already made up their minds about them . anything less than complete praise will be derided by their fans . and those who didn't like the movie in the first place probably will not bother to read the review . for the record , i've liked a lot of music movies in which the music was not of the type i normally enjoy . i've loved rock concert movies ( message to love ) , rock documentaries ( hype ! ) and rock musicals ( pink floyd : the wall ) . stop making sense , on the other hand , did nothing for me . with his lean , gangly body , his thin , geekish face and his exaggerated clothing , byrne stands out in any crowd . the guy must be in tip-top shape to endure his performances , and it is easy to see why he remains so lithe .  the girls can do it too !  called the tom tom club , this silly segment is the film's one attempt at comedy . even though i was glad for a respite from byrne's voice , i missed his stage antics . the movie , filmed at a live concert , consists of a rapid succession of songs without breaks . if you like them , you will probably feel like a kid in a candy shop , in which the owner says you have an hour and a half to eat all the candy you want . and if you don't like the songs , the film can sometimes feel like living next door to a neighbor who plays loud , harsh music that filters through your walls even when you have the windows shut tight . luckily , byrne's high spirits and undeniable charisma offers something for everyone . it is rated pg and has nothing to offend any age .

"director : jon turtletaub . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 124 minutes . there was a sense of deja-vu developing long before i actually saw instinct , inspired by the presentation of the basic premise in the trailers . couldn't help but think i'd seen this somewhere before . then i saw the film , and it all became clear . this wasn't just a case of hopkins flexing his hannibal lecter muscles again before taking on the film version of thomas harris' recently-published sequel to the silence of the lambs . he was simply keeping pace with a story that slaps together characters , situations and exact shots from dozens of other films . you could spend a productive day doing little more than ticking off the films from which instinct cribs : one flew over the cuckoo's nest , gorillas in the mist , tarzan , the shawshank redemption and even dead poets society in addition to the silence of the lambs . gerald dipego's script plods along , dropping its familiar cinematic tropes like bread crumbs leading the audience to its responses . there's even a scene of confounding idiocy in which we , the knee-jerking audience , are supposed to cheer for caulder irresponsibly whipping a room full of jailed psychotics into a rebellious frenzy . somehow , in the midst of so much uninspired tripe , anthony hopkins still manages to come through with a performance that's invigorating to watch . sure , it's a spin on hannibal lecter , but it's more fiercely intelligent than anything the rest of the film can deliver . you can't help but lean forward when you hear that seductive baritone ; you can't help but shudder when caulder's neck hinges on the correct answer to a very tricky question . hopkins makes instinct better . he also makes it worse , because everything else looks even more workmanlike , notably cuba gooding jr . 's performance . a little economy and subtlety -- skills hopkins demonstrates even when playing a wild man -- could have served gooding well . sadly , subtlety is one thing instinct has in very short supply . even viewers prepared to sympathize with the film's fuzzy embrace of the state of nature will find this more a philosophical tract ( albeit one with remarkably realistic animatronic apes by stan winston ) than a compelling drama . we all know man bad/animals good , which makes the decision to turn the humans into cartoonish villains even more perplexing . if there were a moment of real insight into a character , the rest of instinct's brainless cinematic thievery might have been more tolerable . instead , it lets breathing plot devices gab at one another for two hours between unnervingly familiar situations . thank heavens for the entertainment value of anthony hopkins' gloss on film's best-known cannibal . it's only fitting in a film that does plenty of cannibalizing of its own . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject  subscribe  .

"so many characters , so little time . obviously incompatible characters form quickie relationships based mainly on coincidence and convenience . marey , as the anti-model , is the least likely character of all . neither will you . one character claims it is because of her sense of humor , but the script gives her little funny to do or say . drunken women pass out or throw up at the most inopportune moments . although the performances are pleasant enough , the problem with the film is that we've seen it all many times before . this year's love can best be thought of as a dumbed down four weddings and a funeral . this year's love runs 1 : 48 . it is not yet rated but will undoubtedly be an r for sex , drug usage and language . the film would be acceptable for older teenagers .

"screenplay : nicholas kazan , robin swicord . director : danny devito . every once in a while , when an exceptional family film comes along , i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been ; with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children , it is remarkable how many non-disney films disappear in a couple of weeks . now i see that in so doing , i have unfairly ghettoized these films . so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents , but to anyone who wants to support smart , funny , energetic film-making : see matilda . see it in a theater , rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video . see the best film i have seen in 1996 . not the best children's film . . . the best film . period . the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists , and when they do , it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books . it was this spring's james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda . and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton , matilda soars on the cock-eyed direction of danny devito . devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses , and he contributes some memorable images . matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale . it is also characteristic of the best children's tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don't realize that they are learning them . matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment , and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because  i'm big and you're little , i'm right and you're wrong .  more specifically , it has as its heroine an intelligent , self-confident girl who struggles successfully against other people's notions of how she should behave . it is no coincidence that matilda was co-written by robin swicord , who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women . finally , matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment : it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word . devito knows enough to make matilda fast-paced and appealing to children , taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy , including a great chase through her dark house . the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable , with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character . i can't imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted . matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling . i will see it again , and years from now i will watch it with my children . and now i will stop , because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin , and there is a seat in that theater you should be in , if you have a child or ever were a child .

"saskia emotes in a contrasting understated performance to the energetic amanda's . at one point the sweet talking miriam declares ,  mother , auntie kathy , a girl at swimming--and eunice , those are all the people who have kissed me .  this is a pointless , violent road movie about two very sick girls , who are not explained or studied , but are just shown to be on a wreckless course of destruction . but judy might also be viewed as a figment of her warped mind , or perhaps she represents someone from the bible , like the avenger named judith who beheaded an enemy of the israelites . amanda displays a death wish , saying ,  i'm bad , i won't change . punishment is all i understand .  it is not possible to make sense of how these girls relate to each other and how brutally they act . the depravity and depth of alienation she evokes from her character , and the energy that amanda plummer puts into her characterization , make this a fascinating film , if you can ever get past the bleakness of the story .

"i read that it is a sequel to the year my voice broke , which i have not seen , but there were no references to it in this film which effectively stands alone . the last part of the picture is an honest and insightful consideration of adolescent sex . up until the last part , the picture is pure formula and reminded me of a dozen other films . the characters are pleasant enough , but very familiar . if you rent the tape , hang in there because in the last twenty minutes or so the film comes into its own and has something fresh to say . this mass mooning is pretty sophomoric film making . from there the script by the director john duigan takes the standard turns . little happens that you haven't seen before , and the acting , although good , is nothing special . as one of many ways the script just follows the standard formula , all of the teachers are mean and strict . the only question is the degree . these are issues that teenagers have to grapple with today , and this film treats them tenderly and honestly . after having no meaningful music in most of the film , even the music comes alive in the end . i had a problem with the cinematography . the nighttime sequences across the lake are filmed in luminescent darkness so that it looked like a scene from the arabian nights . whereas this worked , most of the film was in sepia tones of the interiors . this looked more dreary than nostalgic which was i think was the intention of the tones . flirting runs a little long at 1 : 39 given the repetitive material . it is in australian english without subtitles . i have seen a lot of non-american english shows so i was able to follow it , but it may leave some dazed and confused . the film is rated r . there is brief nudity , a little sex , mild language , and the violence of a boxing match . it is close to pg-13 , and i think the show would be fine for mature kids as young as 11 or 12 . although i still can not figure out how at least one critic had this film on his best of the year's list , i did like it because the formulaic script finally had something to say toward the end . i give the show a mild thumbs up and * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : may 26 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"cast : john turturro , massimo ghini , stefano dionisi , rade serbedzija , agnieszka wagner director : francesco rosi producers : guido de laurentiis , leo pescarolo screenplay : tonino guerra , sandro petraglia , stefano ruli , and francesco rosi based on the autobiography by primo levi cinematography : pasqualino de santis , marco pontecorvo music : luis enriquez bacalov u . s . distributor : miramax films the truth , as depicted in francesco rosi's the truce , was far more complex . however , while rosi's film deserves recognition for highlighting a forgotten aspect of the jewish post-holocaust experience , there are serious flaws in his approach . a far more powerful and better balanced depiction of this subject can be found in the 1997 non-fiction effort , the long way home , which captured the best documentary oscar . the long way home shows the horror and disgust with which the rescuers viewed the holocaust victims . this almost- worshipful attitude occasionally makes the truce seem more like a piece of pro-soviet propaganda than a legitimate dramatic exploration of what happened when the jews were set free . the film opens with the liberation of auschwitz in early 1945 . while the truce tells a story that is occasionally compelling and disturbing , the film feels like it has been sanitized . in trying to inject some lighthearted humor into a tale that is inherently deeply tragic , director francesco rosi reduces the truce to a series of loosely-connected , semi-comic episodes . inexplicably , supporting characters keep turning up at different points on primo's journey to offer support and encouragement . on the whole , primo's journey seems more like a trek through a land of adventure rather than a shuffle down the road of despair . whenever the truce works , it does so largely due to the moving , introverted performance of john turturro . other than turturro , however , no one in the cast leaves much of an impression . massimo ghini is okay as primo's glib friend , but serbedzija comes across as an over-the-top clown and wagner is never given an opportunity to develop her character into anything more substantial than a token prostitute with a good heart . the truce is not an innately bad film , but rosi makes some ill- advised choices in the way he chooses to present the story . those who have not seen the long way home will probably react more positively to this effort than those who have . when viewed in the light of the documentary , the truce does not fare well . not only is the tone off , but the narrative seems shallow and erratic . turturro's performance partly redeems the proceedings , but even he cannot elevate the truce to the high level at which this material deserves to be presented .  my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down .  -- david puttnam ",2
"few directors have such a unique , some would say bizarre , style as david lynch . his latest , lost highway , is his most unorthodox film yet , but one of his better ones . the press kit describes the movie as a  psychogenic fugue  and a  moebius strip  with elements of lewis carroll and franz kafka . yes , it is all of those and more . lost highway blends film noir with the tension of a horror movie . the power comes from the director's use of silence . ( as you read this review you may be inclined to conclude that you have no interest in seeing the movie , but the film works more effectively than any possible verbal description of it might lead you to believe . ) the sound effects editing and the music enhance the heavy tension . at first , the film has complete silence interspersed with dialog -- no background ambient noise at all . slowly , low natural background sounds are introduced and then this gives way to music consisting of long , low rumbling notes designed to frighten . i see so many films that i get somewhat desensitized , but the first part of this movie managed to scare me badly with devices as natural as the sudden , loud ringing of a phone . an intense and very disturbing film in the beginning . when the parameters of the mystery are revealed , the tension stays , but the film becomes much less disquieting . i am not going to cover any of the film's details . i will just set up the first few minutes of the film . suffice it to say that the film involves character transformation , reincarnation , surreal dreams , and more . to give a feel of what is in store for the viewers , consider another early scene . the script by barry gifford and david lynch perplexes the viewers with all of the false views and disconcerting realities of an escher print . some of the vignettes in the film are priceless . the cinematography by peter deming pushes the limits of the film noir motif . not only are scenes dark but some characters walk into the darkness and disappear as if into an astronomical black hole . you can think of the show as a film constructed with non-euclidean geometry . i still don't understand it , but the movie is not made to be comprehensible . what is less satisfying is the way characters caught in a deadly web such as this never seek advice on what is happening to them . the answers to this and all of the film's conundrums are in the final analysis , unknowable . it is rated r for graphic violence , sex , nudity , and profanity . teenagers should be mature if they go . i was fascinated by this long enigma so i recommend it to you and give it * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"screenplay : ken friedman and yolande finch . director : jonathan kaplan . i'd be willing to bet that someone sold the concept for bad girls with a one-line pitch like ,  the wild bunch in bloomers .  such is the way in hollywood these days . besides , with the paucity of good roles for women , talented actresses like madeleine stowe and mary stuart masterson will jump at that chance to shoot guns . the problem is that these prefabricated films almost never bring along a script . bad girls is always either hopelessly cliche or insufferably stupid--and usually both . the women and the gang of thieves repeatedly cross paths until it becomes clear that this movie ain't big enough for the both of 'em . bad girls is frequently so incoherent that i was forced to wonder whether director had chopped all the raw footage into two minute chunks , strewn them about on the editing room floor and pieced the film together in whatever order he happened to pick them up . screenwriters ken friedman and yolande finch couldn't be bothered with such niceties as explaining why eileen and lily might want to save cody ( at least anita was the one cody saved ) . there is not a second spent letting these characters interact first , so that there seems to be some kind of connection between them . apparently it's enough that they're sisters in the world's oldest profession . wild guess , anyone ? . . . the thing is that this subplot is not only cliche , it's put together in the least economical way possible , with the inclusion of kid jarrett's aging father ( robert loggia ) . this additional character just muddles the movie further ; in fact , i would go so far as to say that the inclusion of the entire josh subplot is unnecessary . but that would have left cody without a love interest , and we couldn't have that , now could we ? oh , but there's more , pardners . in the last two minutes , there is the suggestion that lily harbors a more intimate affection for eileen , something we are completely unaware of until the music swells to a tear-jerking crescendo which means nothing because we have been given no background . james legros makes an appearance as a simple homesteader who wins eileen's heart , but his is the only performance that isn't completely perfunctory . madeleine stowe and mary stuart masterson are two of my favorite current young actresses , and both are forced to spout dialogue which puts the  hack  back in hackneyed . director jonathan kaplan apparently had no idea what to do with a western , so rather than set up his own shots he tries to do his half-hearted homage to sam peckinpah , with disastrous results . whole set pieces are ripped off from the wild bunch , and kaplan's use of slow motion becomes absurdly comic . the cinematography is quite good , but a big pile of garbage is a big pile of garbage no matter what kind of filter you put over the lens . sometimes you can look at a film as bad as bad girls and see the germ of an interesting idea that was undeveloped or simply butchered , but not here . there isn't the faintest attempt to make bad girls a real examination of the plight of women in the american west ; the women are just a gimmick , unlike in the ballad of little jo . bad girls is lazy , stupid , sloppy and , worst of all , boring . they are women , hear me snore .

"not that a minor inconvenience like a metal detector will stop any really determined delinquent . in fact , by the time this brainless action flick has ricocheted to a conclusion , someone has procured a rocket launcher for use in the halls . this is really a steven seagal movie with tom berenger doing his best seagal impression ( although , even at his worst , berenger has about 300% more range than the wooden-faced action star ) . director robert mandel ( f/x ) brings a sense of wry , warped humor to the substitute -- he rarely takes anything too seriously -- but it's not enough to save the film . admittedly , parts are fun in a mindless , visceral sort of way , but the whole is a lot worse than the sum of its parts . setting a vigilante thriller in a high school , even the high school from hell , might seem like a bad idea . after all , since the point of such a movie is for berenger to kick butt and kill people , his options would appear to be limited by the presence of so many juveniles . the clever screen writers have found a way to incorporate lots of nasty adults into the mix . this is no mr . holland's opus or dead poets' society , and no one is going to mistake berenger for richard dreyfuss or robin williams . clips . at one point , there's actually an attempt to espouse some kind of message about kids breaking the cycle of violence .  gang funerals -- is that what you want for yourselves ? for your kids ?  demands shale in one heartbreakingly poignant scene . not much is done with this theme beyond the redemption of a few minor characters , which is probably a good thing , since audiences don't come to this sort of movie for drama . the substitute has its moments , all of which fall in the realm of high camp . one scene not to be missed : shale , attempting to get his class' attention , roars ,  i'm the warrior chief ! i'm the merciless god who rules over everything that stirs in my universe !  it's a hilarious moment , and i'm reasonably certain the director intended for it to be so . nevertheless , aside from a lot of only moderately-satisfying violence , the substitute comes across as rather lame . it's not boring , but that dubious qualification isn't enough to earn the movie a passing grade .

"how could i have imagined as i was making this film that the stifling sense of longing that fills the screen was to become my lot for the rest of my life ; that from now until the end of my days i would bear the painful malady within myself ?  for that reason , seeing how the filmmaker himself was pleased with the film and considered it so important to himself , and because of the power and perfection of craft the film exhibited , it makes it that much easier for me to say that this film ranks as one of his best works , an intriguing masterpiece , that is equal to , if not better than his other masterpieces , solaris , andrei rublyov , the sacrifice , and mirror . the visual images of all the scarved peasant ladies with lit candles and starlings coming out of the virgin's body are , indeed , startling . the mood of the film is gloomy , when a laugh is heard or someone does something silly it is monumental and takes on an unreal scope . the feeling one gets , is somewhat as if a child , saddened by the outside world , is nevertheless able to laugh at something he makes up , and thereby feels good about himself . when the sacristan's response is ,  what are you here for , then ?  the best and truest lines in the film are spoken by the madman . the people are much like the weathermen who can give you the temperature , but are lost when the conversation takes a deeper turn , they are simply not prepared to talk about what they do not comprehend . for tarkovsky , this film is a lifetime journey , made by someone who is in pain and must see this pain through for what it is , because there is no going ahead without taking this pain with him . things do not seem so foreign to him , anymore .

"susan granger's review of  the musketeer  ( universal pictures ) hollywood launches another assault on classic literature with this $50 million adaptation of alexandre dumas's novel that's strong on action but weak on drama , fusing hong kong martial arts with 17th century swordplay . filmed in southern france , the scenery , sets and costumes are spectacular , but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy , restless mtv'ish cuts . as the swashbuckling d'artagnan , bland calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing , totally lacking on-screen charisma , not to mention acting skill . mena suvari , so impressive in  american beauty ,  seems like a contemporary interloper in the royal court . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 ,  the musketeer  is a cinematic but shallow 3 . not this time 'round .

"a sophisticated mid-victorian drama , told in the form of an allegory , about upper class society , playing more like a pbs special or a high-brow merchant-ivory film but with a darker secret to tell . it comments on the environment influencing one's behavior more than anything else , as the female protagonist is studying a colony of red ants attacking black ones . she is like the butterfly , so delicate and beautiful to behold . which refers to the servants , but might be the closest we come to anything resembling angels in this film . she chastises him one day by saying to him ,  you do not know if i am aged 30 or 50'' . if one can read his mind , he is saying to himself i shouldn't have married for looks . he also has a few children , whom he does not feel strongly about . the film was visually pleasing ; the costumes were beautiful ; the script was acceptably literate , and the film ably took the viewer into an antiquated world and its peculiar customs , where the many maids who worked at the estate turned their back to the wall in the presence of their betters , giving one some rough idea about life there . the problem with the film , was that it was tedious and had no emotional oomph to it . the acting was stiff . the pace of the film was lethargic . the most interesting sights were the insects themselves , which if that's your thing , it would be better to view on one of those nature shows public television has . overall , this film showed the dramatic events in too clinical a manner for it to be viewed as anything more than a competent production .

( no , terminal velocity is nowhere near that quality level . ) i have never admired charlie sheen as an action hero . he does the wise-cracking okay , and he's not bad in a fight , but there's one major asset he lacks : an accent . how can you take anyone serious in this sort of movie when they sound like they were born in this country ? even steven seagal has an accent of sorts . . . it's called a monotone . ah , but then there's nastassja kinski , and she has the accent . that doesn't really fit , though , because he gets top billing . sheen isn't the action hero or the token beefcake . he's the comic relief . then again , maybe not . . . the plot takes preposterousness to new levels . i doubt even forrest gump would be able to suspend his disbelief enough to swallow what this movie has to offer , worm and all . the dialogue is as hard-boiled as it comes . these are the kinds of lines that once made dime-store novels so popular . and it's not just occasional .  pack the bags--we're going on a guilt trip  happens to be my favorite , but there are lots more to choose from . terminal velocity has an unfair advantage over many other bad movies : it's too raucous to put anyone to sleep . there are enough explosions , gun fights , and loud music to arouse the attention of even the most disinterested viewer . laughably preposterous--yes ; boring--no . it's an experience , all right--albeit one that most people can do without .

"the leopard son is a g rated nature documentary movie produced by the discovery channel and released to the theaters . think of it as a live action bambi if you like . the show is full of the circle of life where animals eat other for food , but it is rarely gory . even his dad learned a lot about the animal hierarchy that was not obvious . i figured , for example , that a leopard would scare off a baboon , but a leopard is no match for a baboon's strong jaws . i was surprised at how dull the narration is . gielgud's usual melodious voice seems tired and uninvolved . the tone is pleasant enough , but it lacks the necessary degree of warmth to make it compelling . the pedantic script could have learned a lot from the living desert and the other disney nature documentaries from the 50s . they knew how to use a little humor to enliven the story . the script mainly tries to be a fact based autobiography , but thankfully does have its more poetic moments . later he remarks about the animals ,  it looks like a game , but it's so much more . it's about determination and persistence .  the scenery , especially of the large animal herds and of the sunlight and the mist , is spectacular . it never ceases to amaze me how they can get so close even with telephoto lens to photograph animals in the wild . all of this notwithstanding , i was a bit disappointed by the cinematography . i thought the colors seemed washed out and overall , it did not match in quality the images being captured . the editing seems sloppy as well . too often the editing consisted of one long slow scene pasted to another with the effect being too often tedious . the film's sounds are quite effective with the low rumble of the lions and the whinny roar of the young cheetahs being particularly fascinating . on the other hand , stewart copeland's music , which tries to mimic african rhythms , left me cold . it is rated g . small kids might be scared by a couple of the killing scenes , but i don't think so since they are handled so carefully . will your kids like it ? i guess it depends if they like discovery channel sort of shows and if they are patient . this dad was frequently bored during the show . nevertheless , my son is a testament to the effect that the film has appeal . i tried , but just can not bring myself to recommend this picture no matter how well intentioned . i do give it a * * rating for some nice parts . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : october 10 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"screenplay : george welsh and peter jackson . director : peter jackson . earlier this year , i commented on thematically similar films where the later release suffered in comparison to the first . wyatt earp languished in the wake of the less reverent but far more entertaining tombstone ; blown away was blown away by the gleefully brainless speed . it was not a great film , but good enough that i wondered if my evaluation of heavenly creatures might be influenced . but where fun was occasionally stagy and ponderous , heavenly creatures is dazzling , a perversely original psychodrama . the strongest elements in fun were the performances of the two young lead actresses , and ironically the same elements provide the only minor weak link in heavenly creatures . melanie lynskey is the better of the two , playing the more complicated character , but it seems she settles into expressing every emotion by glowering beneath her nest of unruly dark curls ; kate winslet is occasionally a bit much , arching her eyebrows and punching her oh-so-proper upper crust diction . however , their scenes together are quite effective , and they show a natural rapport . lynskey in particular comes alive beautifully , and the intensity of their relationship never seems implausible . it is also illustrated with astonishing creativity by peter jackson , best known for the marvelously demented dead alive . from the first frames , jackson slams us into a world of chaos and delusion , and even through light-hearted scenes there is a sense of foreboding as we await the inevitable conclusion . this is the real triumph of heavenly creatures : although it is alternately a drama , a fantasy and a mystery , it is an absolutely coherent whole . because we know where this relationship will lead , there is an undercurrent of menace in dark-humored sequences where pauline visualizes revenge fantasies . it also presents the disturbing premise that given the right ( or wrong ) circumstances , the fantasy world every adolescent creates could explode into the real world . those circumstances involve a delicate issue , one also raised by fun . since there is a sexual element to the relationship between pauline and juliet , it would be possible to misinterpret the film as suggesting that their crime , leopold and loeb-like , was just another manifestation of their  deviance .  but jackson is up to something more subtle than that . through both his audacious direction and an insightful script , peter jackson has crafted a powerful character study that is unlike anything you'll see this year .

"director : gary sinyor . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 100 minutes . i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor , an innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy . it's not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was nonetheless . i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 . in a word , it's the same thing that's wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing . more to the point , it's the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you're telling a story about a relationship . the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we're expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive , pleasant people just because they're attractive and pleasant . convinced despite his reservations that it's time to  sh * t or get off the pot ,  jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly . it's a wacky , brewster's millions-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the film's better , more self-aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters . at least that would be the case if jimmy weren't already a world-class altruist . it's almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor's plot development . by any human standard , the guy is impossibly selfless . and that's the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness . there's never any tension between the two star-crossed lovers , because there's no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake . and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation . the parade of sit-com set pieces had better be damned funny , since they're all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion . i'll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing , including ustinov's rantings about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks . far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly , like the shudder-inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church . you're never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor , but that's not the real problem . nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it's leading up to . the problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy -- there's no spark , no energy , no humanity . it's an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer's digestions . we've reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don't even have a pulse . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject  subscribe  .

"the third dull hollywood film about mars in a little over a year , after tim burton's  mars attacks !  i would think that three strikes and you're out should apply to any more of these space bombs cast into theaters by producers with big budgets and small stories . this one's a nuts-and- bolts sci-fier that looks good but its dialogue is just terrible , with the capable cast unable to overcome the poorly plotted story and saying things like val kilmer is forced to say about mars ,  things happen on mars that are extreme and otherworldly .  the characters are either undeveloped or predictable stock characters . south african director anthony hoffman directs without imagination , as the film seems to drag on at a lethargic pace . the  red planet  was also void of humor and the obstacles encountered by the astronauts seemed arbitrarily thrown into the film to purposefully give the film an excuse for the special effects to be the star . i think hollywood should reevaluate its plans to make these special effect only films about mars and see if they can go back to the drawing board and put some life into these stories about the earth's last frontier . those b-movies made in the 1950s on a shoestring budget were more entertaining to me than this large-scale leaden sci-fi adventure story . the other crew members are so boring and one-dimensional , that when they started getting picked off one by one , for one reason or another , i was rooting for a more efficient way of getting rid of them , maybe picking up the pace at two at a time killings . this was some crew , lacking in credibility , wit and likability ! the mars lander descends to the surface with gallagher , burchenal , santen , pettengil and chantilas . we then get into the special effects part of the film , the only thing the film can brag about , as there's a well-photographed crash landing scene . did god do it ? it's an interesting theme , but this film was only able to grab onto its spectacular special effects ( showing the mars earth mysteriously moving ) and by proving that there is life on mars , and was not able to follow through on any ideas invested in the far-reaches of the story . i thought the film lacked suspense , and the acting was only bearable , not giving this film too much of a chance to overcome its overall dullness . if you are the kind of viewer who goes bananas for technology , this film might seem better to you than what i thought of it , as that part of the film was stunning , indeed . but if you are interested in a lively story , then i'm afraid you wouldn't get that on this mission .

"producers : leslie urdang and michael hoffman . director : michael hoffman . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , brief nudity ) running time : 115 minutes . the cinematic cynic in me suspects that the lofty , unwieldy title of william shakespeare's a midsummer night's dream has as much to do with timely marketing as it does with a nod to literary fidelity . after all , when adults are flocking to the oscar-winning shakespeare in love and teens are catching  the taming of the shrew  turned into 10 things i hate about you , the bard would seem to be riding a unique wave of cross-demographic hipness . to that extent , this midsummer night is truly william shakespeare's in its mix of disparate elements , with all the delights and potential pitfalls that accompany them . at its most basic level , a midsummer night's dream is a precursor to bedroom farce without the slamming doors ( doors being hard to come by in the forest ) . as the enchanted lovers become a circle of frustration -- lysander is made to love helena , who still loves demetrius , who still loves hermia , who still loves lysander -- saucy exchanges alternate with good old-fashioned female mud wrestling . it takes more than a little while for the film to find its pacing , hindered by the atypically awkward work of strathairn , but once the pleasantly low-tech , stage-set world of the forest becomes the focus , the high and low comedy both begin working . it's an interesting interpretation , but one that doesn't always mesh with the other players . the other major sub-plot becomes both a midsummer night dream's high point and its source of greatest disappointment . unfortunately , hoffman doesn't exploit kline's performance for all it can offer , never really delivering a satisfying resolution to the character he has set up . the bumbling performance is pure slapstick -- malapropped lines , misaligned props , over-the-top acting and , to quote shakespeare in love , a bit with a dog . it's a sweet note on which to end a play of sometimes discordant tones , perhaps making this dream seem less uneven that it should . the course of this tale about the course of true love never does run smooth ; it merely offers a fanciful comedy deserving enough of the author's name . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject  subscribe  .

"there's not much in the way of thrills or surprises in this minor noir film , one that is able to combine a story about diamond smugglers and a smallpox outbreak in the new york city of 1947 . it is mildly diverting because of its able depiction of america's cold war paranoia during the early 1950s against anything foreign , as the film shows how an entire city can become terror stricken by something unknown attacking it . to make sure that you know that he is the heavy in the story , he will speak with a foreign accent . everything foreign in this film is either connected with something sick or with something dangerous to america . the action part of the melodramatic story was weakly told , while the noir characterizations of sheila did capture the desperate feelings of the subject , but it was not enough to overcome the overall inability of the story to have a heart to it . the mechanical acting by everyone , except for keyes , and the unconvincing action scenes made the film appear as the b film it was , despite the great noir camerawork of joseph biroc , who caught how dark the city could be for someone on-the-run .

"warning : the review includes an important spoiler in the first and last paragraph . there's a surprise that is revealed during the end credits : this fascinating documentary turns out to be a mock-documentary , after it hits you over the head with the problems facing many american workers during the changing times of the 1990s and spends the entire film looking like a real documentary . russ hexter , the 27-year-old writer-director , unexpectedly died of an aortic aneurysm shortly after shooting the innovative film , cutting short a possible brilliant career . the chasm between the locals and the newcomers is enormous , being caused mostly by a cultural clash . that it was not for real , does take away a lot of the film's impact and poignancy , but still it leaves the viewer with a sense that it cut through something perplexing that is currently happening , that is part of the human drama that causes some strange behavior to emerge . hexter has thrown open a look at all the social , political , and economic factors involved in the evolution of a small town , and he has done a nice job in showing the human tragedy above all else as being the most important thing to consider , even though in the bigger picture things might look like they are working out , there's still a face you have to put on someone who loses his job .

"the term has at times been used to define any film which women tend to like more than men ( sleepless in seattle comes to mind ) , but in its strictest sense i define a  chick film  as one which deals with relationships men could only attempt to comprehend : mother-daughter , female friendships , and birth mother-child . angie definitely falls within this framework . it's got mothers , daughters , friends , childbirth and a dose of heartbreak to guarantee maximum lacrimal viscosity , and all these things may affect the target audience . i found myself impressed by geena davis' performance , but bothered by the obvious and excessive manipulation which never really pays off , and by some unfortunate mixed messages . davis plays the title character , bensonhurst , brooklyn resident angie scacciapensieri . geena davis' performance as angie is easily the best thing about angie , which is fine because it's also the most important thing . most of davis' roles to date have emphasized her comic talents , but angie confirms what thelma & louise suggested : that davis is a very gifted all around actor . stephen rea is also extremely slick and charming as noel , and the scenes between davis and rea provide many of angie's highlights . through its first hour , angie is an interesting and appealing character drama with real promise . the second half of todd graff's script suffers from two major problems . the first is that it seriously overloads on emotional high points . there were at least four separate points at which i thought that angie had reached its climax , and what made that decision the most frustrating is that none of them quite provided the catharsis that angie needed but always just missed . i got the feeling that hollywood pictures had tested several endings , found that the audiences responded to each one , and then decided to keep them all . consequently , angie loses its narrative momentum two thirds of the way through and coasts to the finish on its tear-jerking . the second , and perhaps more distracting , problem is a rather personal distaste for what i perceived as a sell-out in the change in angie's perspective which occurs at the end of the film . a speech angie makes to her baby surprised me by suggesting that angie believed her problem was thinking too much about herself , when i felt she was thinking about herself for the first time in her life . the fits and starts in the film's many climaxes left me wondering what it was that i was supposed to have learned from angie's story . it is a given that a film like angie pulls emotional strings , and that in itself is not a failing . manipulating our emotions is what films are supposed to do ; the best ones just manage to do it so skillfully that we don't notice or don't care . angie doesn't achieve that deft middle ground . it crosses its signals , piles on the pathos , and leaves its star to carry most of its emotional baggage .

"shown at the philadelphia festival of world cinema running length : 1 : 30 mpaa classification : not rated ( mature themes , sexual situations , profanity ) cast : orvar jens arnarsson , rurik haraldsson , sigrun hjalmtysdottir director : fridrik thor fridriksson screenplay : einar mar gudmundsson cinematography : ari kristinsson no u . s . distribution planned in icelandic with subtitles iceland's motion picture industry may be in its infancy , but fridrik fridriksson's movie days is a very mature effort . the director , who admits that this film is completely autobiographical , said he made the picture to honor his childhood influences and share his impressions on the variety of storytelling methods which led to his becoming involved in film making . elements of cinema paradiso and woody allen's radio days can be seen here , but fridriksson pays homage ; he does not steal . the playful , occasionally-dreamy tone of movie days is all his own . fridriksson loves movies -- that much is clear from the opening moments of this film when he shows his young protagonist , tomas , staring enraptured at a showing of the american biblical saga king of kings . there are other forms of entertainment in 1964 iceland , most notably radio and television , but tomas loves the cinema , whether the offering is a grand epic or a roy rogers flick . in addition to being a fond reminiscence , movie days is also an examination of how american pop culture -- including movies , tv , and music -- wormed its way into the fabric of iceland's society . there , instead of sitting in the darkness staring at a screen filled with wondrous images , he is relegated to lying on his sleeping pallet listening to bedtime stories . nevertheless , tomas comes to enjoy this vastly different life for both its simplicity and its sincerity . movie days does not have an american distributor , nor is it likely to get one . his pictures mix unaffected beauty with freshness and honesty . and what about the image of scandinavian films as slow-moving and deeply- thoughtful ? in fridriksson's own words ,  [ingmar] bergman is boring .  this should say just about all that's necessary about the pacing of movie days .

"screenplay : david hayter . producers : lauren shuler donner and ralph winter . director : bryan singer . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 100 minutes . i think it's fair to say that i've been looking forward to a film version of x-men for a while now -- somewhere in the neighborhood of 23 years , as a matter of fact . x-men #107 was one of the first comic books i ever bought , and it launched me on a love affair with the medium that abated only when , as a college student , i could no longer afford my habit . some readers may suspect that this history would lead me to go easy on an adolescent fan-boy . personally , i thought it would make me much tougher . after all , a 23-year wait can do something to one's expectations . i didn't think i'd settle for anything less than the kind of comic book adaptation you almost never see : one that combines rousing heroic action with a solid story . to my joy and astonishment , that's exactly what i got . x-men is not just a great comic book movie ; it's actually a pretty good movie _period_ . for those unfamiliar with the source material , the x-men are mutants -- humans with unusual powers that manifest themselves during puberty . that choice not only gives the story an emotional anchor , it gives plenty of screen time to x-men's most intriguing character and easily its best performance . you've probably never seen australian actor hugh jackman before -- though he resembles a brawnier gary sinise -- but you will see him again , because the guy has charisma to burn . jackman offers everything a fan could hope for in a portrayal of wolverine , from the trademark muttonchops to the genuine sense of mystery and menace . if x-men had nothing else going for it but jackman , it would still be worth seeing . the wonderful thing is that x-men _does_ have more going for it . it offers dozens of insider gags for the x-men faithful , while avoiding the slavish devotion to every detail that can interfere in solid film story-telling . and , just in case it matters to anyone , it offers some of the kick-ass-in'-est action scenes this side of the matrix . the fact that you don't have to wade through 90 minutes of junk to get to it is a wonderful bonus . of course x-men has its flaws . there's not much for halle berry to do but look intense when her eyes go white , which is probably all for the best given the incredible disappearing accent she occasionally employs . the script also doesn't do quite enough with turning magneto into a genuinely tragic villain , especially given the amount of time devoted to his back-story in the prologue . it's always tough for a film like x-men to lay the foundation while still delivering the goods , so it's inevitable that there are going to be some lulls and loose ends . i was startled , however , by how few there were . maybe my inner adolescent fan-boy did emerge during x-men , but it emerged because the film reminded me of the best the comic book had to offer , as well as some of the best an action film can offer . i think it was worth the wait , though i have a sneaking suspicion it won't be 23 years before the x-men hit the screen again . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject  subscribe  .

"richard iii -- it's shakespeare that has nothing to do with kenneth branagh . actually , at first glance , this film doesn't appear to have anything to do with the bard's play , either . opening in a 1930's england war room with a tank crashing through a wall , one is immediately struck by the realization that , whatever this movie is doing , it certainly isn't preserving the story's original time frame . however , while the sets and costumes have been moved to a mythical , nazi-like pre-wwii england , the dialogue , characters , actions , and themes remain unchanged from the original text by shakespeare . while this curious clash between a near-modern setting and the much older source material might seem confounding , it actually serves to energize the play , as well as making it more palatable to present-day audiences . being released at the same time as a new version of othello ( which has branagh , along with laurence fishburn and irene jacob ) , richard iii is likely either to usher in a new , mini-era of screen shakespeare revival , or show that two shakespeare films are capable of glutting a small marketplace . othello is a far more traditional interpretation than richard iii , and , other than authorship , about the only thing the movies have in common is that both excise significant portions of dialogue from the original text in the interest of saving time . sir ian mckellan , a veteran of screen and stage , takes the title role of richard and turns in a performance that is equal parts captivating magnetism and chilling menace . it's an amazing piece of acting that is worthy of notice at oscar nomination time . does richard have a conscience ? can evil such as his triumph completely , with no recompense expected on this side of the grave ? can the british monarchy exist without venom and corruption filtering up to the highest levels ? these are a few of the more cogent questions addressed by richard iii , and mckellan and director richard loncraine make sure that they remain intact in the final version of the film . in its own bloody way , richard iii is as enjoyable to watch as any recent screen production of shakespeare , and the shift to the 1930's with its attendant nazi imagery ( parallels between richard iii and hitler abound ) gives the film a twist that conventional productions do not have . if there's a flaw to the movie , it's that this is one of shakespeare's least ambitious and less thematically rich plays . nevertheless , since the only memorable motion picture version is lawrence olivier's 1956 version , richard iii doesn't suffer from overexposure , and this new interpretation offers an unconventional-- and easily accessible -- perspective .

"patience . in this jerry bruckheimer era of rock 'em , sock 'em filmmaking , audiences have little patience . worse , when they do , the films frequently don't deliver the rewards promised by their slow approach , frustrating audiences and making them more likely to go for quick gratification the next time . there's nothing like watching bruce willis save the world , or some large part of it , to pump up your adrenaline . in a complete opposite to the in-your-face action style of filmmaking , ang lee's career has been devoted to the human dimension . from his comedic eat drink man woman to his intimate sense and sensibility to his biting the ice storm , his pictures have cut through the gloss to deliver fascinating , realistic character studies . those going expecting a traditional war picture will be sorely disappointed . if that's the film you want , then lee is not the director to make it . ride with the devil moves with its own methodical rhythms and with most of its story told in quiet moments of anguish as the bushwhackers hide between fights . battle scenes there are , but they are few and far between and rarely take center stage . lee sets this in a wonderfully pastoral setting , full of chirping crickets , clucking hens and mooing cows . it was a time when not much of anything lasted . the letters are full of resignation to the fact that the recipient or the sender or both may be dead before the letter is delivered . the beauty of lee's picture is that he relates their story with compassion but without schmaltz . enlightening , fascinating and tender , it is the movie for those who want to get behind the lines and the action and get to know the individuals drawn into such a hellacious situation . it is rated r for some graphic war violence and would be fine for older teenagers .

"exhilaration please , not exhaustion . full of self-importance , directors this christmas season have lost all sense of proportion . movies seem to take an eternity for no discernable reason . in his non-musical anna and the king , rather than giving us something for our minds and our hearts , andy tennant gives us butt-numbing length as we watch what is admittedly an absolutely gorgeous picture . the cinematography ( caleb deschanel ) , the sets ( ian whittaker and luciana arrighi ) , the costumes ( jenny beavan ) and the music ( george fenton ) are all absolutely dazzling . but with steve meerson and peter krikes's pedestrian script , there is little to engage us . the net result of such beauty , scored to lush orchestral music , is to literally put us to sleep as it did several men , women and children in my packed audience . the fault does not lie with the actors . the chemistry between them is never quite believable , but it really isn't their fault . the written material they have to work with is awkward , and tennant's direction is languid . in a key scene , for example , in which blowing up a bridge quickly is the key to survival , tennant has his actors move with a glacial pace . we get the point that the siamese in the picture do not speak proper english , and their butchered english syntax and semantics can be funny . but , after a while , this repetitive joke gets quite tiresome . so would songs have been an improvement ? you bet ! visuals are important , but they aren't enough to carry a picture . anna and the king needs something to make it compelling , and a few songs certainly wouldn't hurt . a large part of the film is in thai with english subtitles . it is rated pg-13 for some intense violent sequences . given the explicitness of the bloody caning and some of the other scenes , the film might have been more appropriately rated r . it would be acceptable for teenagers .

"where are the flying cows when you really need them ? dante's peak is obviously predicated on the dubious idea that bigger is better . 1996's twister brought in hundreds of millions at the box office by showcasing relatively small ( if something so destructive can be gauged as  small  ) natural disasters -- namely , tornadoes . the next logical step would be to go for something larger and more devastating . apparently , hurricanes weren't deemed visually impressive enough and earthquakes have been done to death , so hollywood has set its sights on volcanoes with not one , but two , similarly-themed disaster flicks . let's just hope volcano shows a glimmer more intelligence , not to mention a higher energy level , than dante's peak . no one is ever going to accuse twister of being a masterpiece of originality , but , as roller-coaster movie go , it's a great deal of fun . part of the reason is the effective use of audio and visual effects ; the other part is that director jan de bont knows how to get the adrenaline flowing . twister is a rush . dante's peak , on the other hand , is a bore . oh , it has its moments , but most of them are concentrated in the final forty-five minutes . the first hour , which is all typical disaster movie setup , is interminable . in keeping with time-tested formulas , we have a male/female pairing , children and animals in danger , a voice of reason that no one listens to until its too late , and a character with a tragedy in the past . the first hour of dante's peak is spent getting to know the characters . not that we need that much time , since they're all familiar types . if you manage to stay awake through fifty-five minutes of drivel , you'll be rewarded with some nifty special effects as the mountain throws everything it has at the town : fire , water , air , and earth . it's pretty impressive , i admit , but there's an unwelcome sense of deja vu . as recently as the aforementioned twister , we've already been there and done that , and it was a lot more enjoyable last time around . brosnan and hamilton gamely try to generate some chemistry , and , while both are appealing in their own right , the moronic plotline and dumb dialogue defeat them at nearly every turn . it will come as no surprise for astute viewers to learn that the screenwriter for dante's peak , leslie bohem , also wrote stallone's daylight . both movies feature some similarly embarrassing bad lines . meanwhile , director roger donaldson ( no way out , the getaway ) fails repeatedly to do anything interesting to enliven the proceedings . even discounting the first hour , dante's peak still isn't all that satisfying . i suppose there's a certain degree of tension as harry and company flee rivers of molten lava and volcanic shockwaves in their attempt to get out of town before it's buried in ash , but , with everything being done according to a well-established formula , the level of excitement stays low . once the film is over , you'll likely acknowledge that , although there's some nice eye candy , the experience as a whole leaves something to be desired . and there aren't even any flying cows to redeem the situation .

"berlinger and sinofsky painstakingly chronicle ten months worth of developments , illustrating how easily justice can be swayed . there's no way that this movie can answer the question of the defendants' guilt or innocence , but one piece of information is clear from paradise lost : jessie misskelly , damien echols , and jason baldwin did not receive fair trials . because damien was  different  by his own admission -- he wore black , listened to metallica , and had shown interest in the wicca religion -- he made an excellent target . berlinger and sinofsky have obtained an amazingly in-depth and intimate picture of the situation . as a result , there are no faceless entities here -- all of the participants have personalities . suddenly , the documentarians were no longer detached observers , but participants . and , while it's unlikely that their  contribution  affected the outcome , it's impossible to say for certain . ultimately , however , when you consider the nature of paradise lost's main concerns , this matter is of secondary importance . arthur miller's the crucible , which is due in theaters this fall , offers the salem witch trials as a parallel to mccarthyism . paradise lost shows that witch hunts didn't end centuries , or even decades , ago . the mere hint of satanism doomed their cases , even if their only real crimes were listening to heavy metal music , wearing strange clothing , and holding unconventional beliefs . there's much about these three that we'll never know , but the scary thing is that the men and women of west memphis don't care about those gaps . truth has become far less important than closure . and it doesn't matter that , if these boys are innocent , the real killers are still free . no documentary released in 1996 challenges an audience the way this one does . the questions it proposes are profound , and there are no answers . paradise lost is one of a very few films that completely absorbs the attention . watching berlinger and sinofsky's movie is like witnessing an execution : it's horrifying , gut-wrenching , and impossible to turn away from . paradise lost is the kind of film that will leave even the most devout defendants of the legal system either shaken or shaking their heads . -- ingmar bergman ",1

"harry cohn , head of columbia pictures , gave joseph h . lewis his first break to make a classier picture than his previous low-budget ones , and when he saw the early rushes of the film , he elevated  my name is julia ross ,  from a 10-day  b  to an 18-day  a  picture . though not original in motif , nevertheless this film is a beauty , one that is able through its visualizations to strike a fresh looking chord . it is noted for its brooding atmosphere , its classical noir camera work , as the heroine is seen forlornly looking out of windows with bars on them , and the film is particularly noteworthy for the fine performances of its stars , nina foch as julia ross , dame may whitty as mrs . hughes , and george macready as ralph hughes . ralph is a rather frightening character , often seen whittling intensely away with his knife . lewis comes up with a few interesting plot twists to make the story even more scary , as the trapped julia fights desperately to save her life , figuring her best chance , is to get word to dennis . the result is a pretty good suspense story and the beginning of lewis's illustrious career in directing a better type of a film .

"dunston checks in is a kids movie that tells the story of an animal various called in the movie either an ape or a monkey . this is one of several parts of the movie that is mean spirited and inappropriate for its intended audience , but , to be fair , most of the film is harmless . most of the jokes in the movie are slapstick , and few are funny . these provide a nice diversion from an otherwise dismal film . dunston is a lovable and quite serious ape with big eyes . seeing him dressed in one crazy costume ( eugenie krager ) after another plus his serious and soulful expressions are easily the best parts of the show . why is this in a movie aimed primarily at the 4-10 set ? what is this scene doing in a kid's movie ? why ? the two boy actors in the show are cute but have no script with which to work . the others in the movie are all in the barely acceptable category with the exception of rupert everett whose theoretically funny version of an english aristocrat is so pathetic you will find yourself looking at your shoes when he is on the screen . he asks questions like ,  where do you keep your champagne ? and  from the look of my soup i'd say someone in your kitchen has a serious hair loss problem .  these are actually some of the better pieces of drivel the actors have to utter . in the sight gags , we have poor dunston , who is naturally compelling , being forced to do such silliness as drink perfume , put women's underwear on his head , and drink water that is holding false teeth . none of these setups are original or funny . in perhaps the most out of place scene in the show , dunston gives an erotic message to a woman wrapped only in a towel . remember again , the age audience that is going to see this film . a strange performance to say the least . thanks to meandering editing by jon poll , it feels much longer . it is rated pg , but it should be pg-13 for all of the above mentioned inappropriate scenes . most of these should have been cut out anyway in a movie certain to be seen mainly by kids 4-10 no matter what the rating . i do not recommend this show to anyone . to be fair , i should point out that my son jeffrey ( age 6 3/4 ) liked it and gives it his usual thumbs up . at least there was nothing in it to scare him . i give the movie * solely for dunston's potential and his great serious look . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"for reasons that partially escape me , this film had the same effect on me as the shawshank redemption . both were filled with marvelous performances and both had people in dire circumstances coping in ways that earned the empathy of their audience . the cliff's notes version of the film would be  revenge ,  but if that makes you think of some cheap charles bronson action flick , then think again . the revenge here comes much later and in much more subtle and surprising ways . although certain portions are shocking , this is not one of those exploitive shows nor even one of the sensational , even if excellent shows like pulp fiction . for the record , let me say that i approached the film as fiction . it is reported to be based on fact , but whether it is or not is in some dispute . this is a great film regardless of its veracity . in fact , the single best part of the film is the highly literate script by levinson based on lorenzo carcaterra's novel . there is just enough humor in it to break the tension , but the script is filled with moving prose . told with heavy narration by lorenzo , a . a . i am going to resist the urge to tell you any more of the plot . you need to see the movie . few films have so many actors displaying their talent so effectively . i left the theater nothing short of amazed at what i had just seen . exquisitely crafted cinema . he also tells us that after seven years your record is purged so that you were never there and whatever happened , didn't . sleepers runs 2 : 32 , but feels like half that long since your eyes stay glued to the screen . sleepers is rated r for strong language , brief nudity , violence , and believable but not carefully done scenes of the rape of boys . teenagers , if they go , should be older and mature . i give this film my strongest recommendation and rate it a full * * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : october 15 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

"lewton's fingerprints are all over the literary script that was made into an intelligent , well-crafted and bizarre thriller . it is noirish in attitude and gothic in tone , enhanced by dark shadowy cinematography and mark robson's crisp direction , which brings about a mixture of ominous danger and a feel for the offbeat . it opens with a grim john donne poem to set the stage for the upcoming action ,  i run to death , and death meets me as fast , and all my pleasures are like yesterday . . .  . it's easy to dismiss the film's flaws , such as cramming too much story into such a short time frame of 71 minutes , but it is better to concentrate on the artfully told b-film and all the personal touches found that make the film so clever . when viewed that way , this low-budget film is simply superb , equal to producer val lewton's  cat people  ( 42 ) . for its time period of the 1940s , it bravely touches on suicide as a necessary part of the plot and covers satanic cults in a mature manner , by showing that ordinary types can join such a cult .

"the first half of this film drags . the coy sparring between miss bentley and the major can't sustain the viewer's interest by itself , and there's little else going on . trevor bentham's script is smart , dry , and , too often , stagnant . aside from a few droll comic interludes ( including a very funny tennis match ) , it takes a long time for a month by the lake to get moving . when it does , it's enjoyable in the way that most intelligent romantic comedies are enjoyable , but there is an obvious start-up penalty . as is often the case , no matter what kind of role she plays , redgrave steals the show . buoyant and cheerful , miss bentley is an instantly likable character--far from the sort of stodgy fifty- something englishwoman abroad one might expect . edward fox plays major wilshaw as a somewhat laughable , pompous bore . yet , even though the character often comes across as fatuous , fox knows when to reign in the comic element . there is a touching moment late in the film when wilshaw shows that , as thick as his emotional armor is , the proper thrust can still penetrate it . this scene , which takes place during a magic show , is a month by the lake's most serious , as well as one of its finest . uma thurman , fresh from the glitz of pulp fiction , intentionally overplays her role as an american hussy . taking a cue from the widows' peak performance of natasha richardson ( redgrave's daughter ) , thurman turns her miss beaumont into the perfect caricature--someone whose only two purposes are to add comic flair and romantic complications to a relatively static plot . without miss beaumont , nothing would have happened between miss bentley and major wilshaw , and without thurman , nothing would have happened in this movie . romance for the over-fifty crowd is a rare commodity in motion pictures . judging by the average hollywood take on the matter , one might easily assume that it's rare for someone with gray hair to fall in love . it's unfortunate that it takes so long to set up the situation , as the most lasting effect of this slow start is to dampen the eventual payoff .

"although he gets both , neither provides a very satisfying substitute for real flesh-and-blood encounters . the film , set in some indefinite time in the future , manages to find insightful things to say about everything from the importance of relationships to the need for real sex to the scary consequences of a nanny state . it even skewers insurance companies by pointing out that too much care can sometimes be a bad thing . the film is funny , sad and frequently downright weird with the bizarre facial paint that people in the future wear . of course , how would metal spikes through someone's nose , lip or eyebrow have been thought of by someone in the nineteenth century ? tastes change and not always for the better . sometimes he is connected to a real person , and other times he reaches a canned video . the film gives us a glimpse at how the women come to join such a service . much like watching  the dating game ,  we keep wondering whether thomas will choose bachelorette number one , the tearful and mysteriously sad eva ( aylin yay ) , or bachelorette number two , the immature but exuberant melodie ( magali pinglaut ) . he might even do something more frightening still . this much is certain , there's incredible profit to be made if some entrepreneur could just come up with the right product tie-in for the movie . the film is in french with english subtitles . it is not rated but would be an r for animated sex , language and mature themes and would be acceptable for older teenagers . just send me a letter with the word  subscribe  in the subject line .

" talking about love is like dancing about architecture .  ( the film's original title was dancing about architecture , but they were forced into changing it before its release since the title was deemed too close in name to dancing at lughnasa . ) the characters , who appear on a virtual revolving stage , do exactly that -- talk incessantly , in excessively  clever  monologues , about love . pairs of actors deliver most of the speeches , but the actors frequently sound like they are addressing the audience and not each other . the story switches every few minutes between the seemingly disjoint stories in the same way that the old carousel of progress at disneyland kept rotating the audience to a new stage . eventually and predictably , the movie , written and directed by willard carroll , brings all of the disparate pieces together like a jigsaw puzzle that is solved , miraculously , by dropping all of the pieces on the floor . there is only one true surprise in the story's resolution , which does provide some much-needed humor in an otherwise sappy script . this same basic plot format worked successfully in robert altman's short cuts , but playing by heart doesn't have the same intelligent level of writing as short cuts . looking handsomer every year , sean connery plays the male half of the older couple in the play -- oops , i mean movie , although it certainly feels like a play . they have agreeable little arguments in which he says things like ,  there isn't anything to talk about ; of course there is , but i don't want to talk about it .  like most of the movie , things are transparently not what they appear to be on the surface . and by hugh's second fake story , you can begin to see what is going on . whether you care or not , given the cloying level of the pseudo-sophisticated dialog , is questionable .  i'm better at all the lies i've manufactured than the lies i'm living ,  hugh confesses . the cynical and melancholy movie wants to be romantic and message-rich , but comes across instead as stilted and dishonest as hugh's barroom prevarications . playing by heart runs 2 : 01 . it is rated r for profanity , sexual situations and mature themes and would be fine for teenagers .

"for what it's worth , matt healy's script for clay pigeons is remarkably unpredictable as film scripts go . big-city shelby doesn't by clay's folksy protestations of innocence , leading to culture clash . is it a serial killer thriller , a dark comedy , or a tarantino-era spin on small-town stagnation -- the last picture show with stab wounds and copious use of a certain  f-word ?  i didn't mind not knowing from one moment to the next where clay pigeons might take me . i did mind that by the time i got where it was taking me , i didn't much care . joaquin phoenix brings his wounded , sensitive demeanor to clay , making him a sympathetic enough protagonist in spite of his flaws . director david dobkin , on the other hand , doesn't seem nearly as interested in investing us in clay's plight , or the hints that clay's learning something about himself through it all . just when he should be trying for some hook into the story -- whether emotional or comedic -- dobkin lets the narrative get progressively grimmer , chillier and more remote . it's a tic-and-flourish film in search of a solid center . it's a shame he couldn't have done more with an intriguing , eccentric cast . janeane garofolo tries to give her ironic observations on small-town ways some bite , but her character always seems to belong in a slightly different movie . a film that could have been a quirky original instead feels merely off-putting , as though the director is daring the audience to find something to enjoy . unpredictability can only carry a film so far ; clay pigeons makes you feel like a sucker for coming along for the ride . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line  subscribe  .

"starring : charlton heston , sofia loren , john fraser , genevieve page , herbert lom director : anthony mann producer : samuel bronston screenplay : frederic m . frank and philip yordan music : miklos rozsa re-released by miramax films and martin scorsese  el cid is one of the greatest epic films ever made . lavish praise from martin scorsese , one of the forces behind the restoration and re-release of el cid . pardon me if i am not wholly in agreement with him . el cid is definitely not a good source for a factual biography ( the identity of diaz' wife and the premise of the finale are a few of the more obvious occasions when the truth is completely ignored ) . using similar methods and equal care to that which was given to lawrence of arabia , the restoration of el cid is an impressive undertaking . the sound quality on this new print is flawless and , for the most part , the picture is better than one would expect from a thirty-two year old film . there are several frames that are far from mint condition , but the overall effect is impressive , and the colors are never washed-out . the battle scenes of el cid are breathtaking , and well worth the effort of seeing on a large screen . video viewing of the climactic struggle would greatly diminish the impact , and it is in this context that it's possible to understand scorsese's quote . this is definitely a film meant for theaters . the television screen will serve only to limit the high points and magnify the numerous , often-glaring weaknesses . instead of el cid seeming like an epic , it could come off looking rather stupid . that's because beyond the spectacle and pageantry , el cid's virtues are limited . the costumes and set design are as impressive as the magnificent backdrops against which the turbulent struggles of the armies occur , and the effort necessary to orchestrate the realistic clash of thousands of swords is mind-boggling , but while these things add a great deal to the film , they cannot entirely cover up its shortcomings . acting is by far the biggest problem . while both charlton heston and sofia loren have imposing screen personalities , neither is capable of projecting real emotion or drawing us into a rapport with the characters . simply put , heston and loren are wooden , and there are only a few occasions on which they manage to make diaz or chimene real . the chemistry between them is flat , conveying little , if any , passion .  smouldering  is not a word anyone would use to describe this couple . the plot is high melodrama with few surprises . el cid turns far more often to the ridiculous than the sublime , and the last scenes contain an element that is downright silly . perhaps if the movie didn't take itself so seriously , there wouldn't be as many opportunities for unintentional laughter , but el cid is about as self-important as a motion picture can be . it is an epic , after all , but in case we've forgotten , there's always the needlessly florid dialogue and stentorian score to remind us . obviously , they don't make movies like this any more , and that's both good and bad . while there's a lot in this film that modern pictures don't need to harken back to , it would be nice to see some of the flair . when recalling great battles in recent films , only a few come to mind ( last of the mohicans and glory , for example ) , none of which have the scope or sheer power of what anthony mann achieved in el cid . so , while i'm personally not ready to anoint el cid as the timeless epic classic that it has become , i'll not pepper it with arrows of disdain , either . this is a grand movie with tremendous aspirations that are not always realized . nevertheless , it's an entertaining , if not transcendental way to spend three-plus hours .
