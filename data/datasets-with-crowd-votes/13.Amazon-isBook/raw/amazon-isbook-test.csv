"The DC Comics Encyclopedia is one of those books that in the past would've been issued by the publisher as a monthly comic issue detailing all the heroes and villains (major and minor) of the DC Universe. As much as I would've been ok with that type of format, I rather enjoy having everything collected, collated and put together under one hardcover edition.This source book is only as up-to-date as of 2004. It won't include the Infinite Crisis and 52 story-arcs, but the encyclopedia pretty much includes every character from the Golden Age of DC Comics during the late 30's through 50's, through the Silver Age right after then up to the Modern Age of the now. Even the most minor character, such as Major Damage gets a full bio entry and explanations of abilities and weaknesses. Of course, the book makes large sections set aside for the major characters (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, etc...). From their entire history from the characters inception all the way to specific bio's for characters who have inhabited the mantle of a certain hero (Flash and Green Lantern being the two major examples).The artwork included in the encyclopedia are lifted from issues from througout a certain character's history. You get artwork from that character's Golden Age look all the way to its modern incarnation. I can't really find any flaw in this sourcebook. It's succeeded in conveying the information it's suppose to give its reader. Here's to hoping they follow-up with a supplemental hardback detailing changes and additions since 2004",1
I purchased this DVD for our 3 year old daughter and within 2 days we had her counting in French. It was very slow paced and repeatative. She loved it and we were able to refresh our skills as well. Ignore the negative ratings and give this a shot. You will find yourself speaking French in small amounts but something is better than nothing.,0
"Ninety-nine percent of the literature on the Spanish Civil War suffers from a heavy leftist bias, so it is almost impossible to find any publication showing this conflict in a balanced perspective. In this context the importance of Antony Beevor's book is truly immeasurable. To the readers familiar with the usual liberal orthodoxies on the subject the following quotes from the introduction will feel like a breath of fresh air:""The Spanish Civil War has so often been portrayed as a clash beyween left and right, but this is a misleading simplification.""""...the Spanish Civil War remains one of the few modern conflicts whose history had been written more effectively by the losers than by the winners.""""...it is unwise to try to judge the terrible conflict of seventy years ago with the liberal values and attitudes that we accept today as normal.""""The ideals of liberty and democracy formed the basis of the Republic's cause abroad. Yet the revolutionary reality on the ground, the impotence of the Spanish parliament,... and the lack of respect for the rule of law on both sides, must be looked at carefully.""""If the coalition of the right had won [the February 1936] elections, would the left have accepted the legitimate result? One strongly suspects not. The socialist leader Largo Caballero threatened openly before the elections that if the right won, it would be open civil war.""""...for the left to claim that the nationalists had launched an unprovoked attack against law-abiding democrats is disingenuous. The left had often shown as little respect for the democratic process and the rule of law as the right.""""Truth was indeed the first casualty of the Spanish Civil War.""Amen to all that. ""The Battle for Spain"" is a must read for an independently thinking individual (an endangered species in our age of brainwashing and ignorance).PS. To measure up to my pseudonym, I would like to point out a minor error on page 115 of the hardcover edition where Beevor mentions ""Napoleon's Polish lancers"" charging up the Somosierra pass on November 30, 1808. In fact, at the time of the charge they had been still a regiment of light horse in the Young Guard; they received their lances only after the Wagram campaign in 1809",1
"We are not in the information age, but rather the information overload age. People handle information overload by seeking out experts, and publishing information products helps make you an expert. Experts benefit by selling information products or perhaps giving them away to help further establish their expertise, which can lead to more and better work.I often blog on how bloggers should repackage their information into information products like books, ebooks, special reports, audio CDs etc. Stephanie Chandler's recent book is a great and pretty thorough overview of information products -- creating, marketing and more, that I'll be recommending to many people.I know this topic pretty well having aided several clients in producing and marketing info products, and this book is simply full of solid advice. I'm not sure how I could have made it better had I written it myself, and it's usually easy to offer constructive criticism in hindsight. I certainly learned a few things, and the book has a nice organization and flow.I particularly liked the Infopreneur Profiles, perhaps in part because I know several of them personally. Great choices!If I had to make one criticism, it would be the amount of coverage to traditional books. Then again, they are the ""original"" info product and the best at establish one as an ""expert.",1
"This is the best book available right now for learning general theory of subsurface fishing. Hughes codifies all the previous knowledge and techniques of famous fly-fishers of the past and compiles all of this into a book that is informative and very easy to read. The discussion of the patterns is worth the price alone. The techniques for fishing the patterns could be put in another book and would be a bargin itself. And his personal knowledge and friendship with Nemes, Hidy, and Rosenberg is demonstrated in stories of fishing with them. Really, this book is good read at any time of the year, not just the winter. Get it, read it, use it",1

"I am giving this one five stars simply because of the information I was able to glean from it.  This of course was one of the first attempts at a full biography of Wilder, and lacking though it may be in many areas, it is still packed with wonderful tidbits and the pictures and great.  Being a ""Laura"" fan for years, I found the subject of Wilder's life fascinating. The author could have left out any mention of the T.V. Series, which was certainly good, don't get me wrong, but actually had little to do with the Wilder story or her work.  The author's technique and style, of this biography, is not my cup of tea, but he was able to get enough facts in to make it well worth the read.  Like other reviewers here, I had to wonder ""what were the publishers thinking,"" when they chose the cover for this book.  I do not feel I have ever gazed upon such a hideous piece of work.  Overall, recommed.",1
I am a parent of two homeschooled teenagers and highly recommend this book not only for teens but for others who are still searching for their &quot;niche&quot; in life.  The author gives very practical ideas on  helping make decisions about their vocation and does not automatically  assume that college is the way to get there,1
"The Judas Priest documentary the other reviewer mentioned is Heavy Metal Parking Lot by Jeff Krulik. It's not available on Amazon, or any mass market vendor, unfortunately, but you can read about it, and about his other films, at his website. (Google 'Krulik') I recommend the 'Krulik and Friends' compilation tape, if you can find it. Both Chris Smith films and Krulik's films are documentaries with offbeat humor and a collection of oddball people as subjects, which are treated with love in the final analysis, though you may laugh AT them at first (like Mark and Mike in American Movie). People who enjoy one would likely enjoy the other, I think",0
"Written around 50 years ago this book still holds true. It is incredibly easy to read and will help your gear your mind towards success. Like most 'success' based books the concepts in here won't make your jaw drop in shock and awe as they are all essentially pretty simple - Think Success and Gain Success. The belief in your ability to achieve something is the first and most important step towards success. Believing you can, will spur your mind to support your belief with reasons, it will find a HOW so you can achieve your goal. Conversely, if you believe you can't, your mind will find reasons to support your claim,The application is always the challenge but this book definitely inspires you to tap into the innate potential within. Coincidentally this book arrived a few days before I had an important job interview and put me in the success frame of mind. I passed the first interview easily, nailed the second one and got the job! It's the sort of book you will read again and again to keep the concepts fresh in your mind. It's also a book you will want to lend people you care about.Highly reccommended. Buy it!",1

"At a time when books, music, movies and television produce many negative images of African Americans, this book is a gentle flow of warm air on the cold hard thoughts about African American people. This book is written for all people. You come away from the stories with a new appreciation of a people who are almost never portrayed in a positive light. Lisa Nichols has gathered stories that will warm your heart and inspire you to evaluate your position on certain issues. This is not the typical collection of stories which blame men or other races. These stories celebrate the African American culture with examples of love, kindness with a few miracles to dropped in. My favorite story is by Mike Jones, he gives a pure loving tribute to the multicultural aspect of this country. ",1
"As a Performance Development Specialist in the automotive components  field, I am always looking for ways to enhance the leadership programs I am  associated with. I read the reviews of this book first and then read four  chapters randomly to determine if the negative reviews were valid in any  way. My conclusion is that the critics of this book do not have an  understanding of what leadership is. There is more hard data and usefull  information packed into this less than 300 page book than any other single  source I have found. Page 108 should be mandatory reading for all  Americans. I can only conclude that the few negative reviews were from  people who are naturally inclined to be against anything associated with  the military or authority figures in general. We in the business community  would be much better off if we practiced some of the skills and  characteristic behaviors that obviously were acquired through years of  sacrifice and contributions. Wisdom is indeed paid for",1
"      In Africa Unchained (January 2005), Ayittey takes a new fresh look at Africa's future and makes a number of daring suggestions.       First, he says economic development requires investment, both foreign and domestic. Investment, however, does not take place in a  swamp or vacuum but in an ""enabling environment,"" which must have, among others, the following features: security of persons and property; rule of law; and basic functioning infrastructure.      This environment does not exist in many parts of Africa because of the absence of a few key critical institutions: an independent media, an independent central bank, and an independent judiciary. These institutions are established by civil society or parliament, not by corrupt leaders since they are fundamentally opposed to the establishment of institutions that will check their arbitrary use of power.       Second, looking at how Africa can modernize, build, and improve their indigenous institutions, which have been castigated by African leaders as ""backward and primitive,"" Ayittey argues that Africa should build and expand upon these traditions of free markets and free trade. Asking why the poorest Africans haven't been able to prosper in the 21st century, Ayittey makes the answer obvious: their economic freedom was snatched from them.      War and conflict replaced peace and the infrastructure crumbled. In a book that will be pondered over and argued about as much as his previous volumes, Ayittey looks at the possibilities for indigenous structures to revive a troubled continent.

"""Time Regained"" is a dark ending to the ""In Search of Lost Time"" cycle, as Proust, sickly like his fictional narrator, unknowingly nears the end of his own life but senses its imminence.  France, like the most of the rest of the world, is now a very different place.  The Dreyfus affair is receding into the past under the shadow of the new war that has descended upon Europe, with Germany having ravaged Belgium and threatening to destroy London and Paris.  Many of the people with whom Marcel has associated throughout his life and whom we came to know so intimately through the pages of his chronicle are now dead, whether by disease, accident, old age, or the war.  Those among the living  include the Baron de Charlus, who sympathizes with the Germans and frequents a hotel that serves as a male brothel; Bloch, who has de-Judaicized his name and has assumed an English chic; and Odette and her daughter Gilberte, the latter now herself a mother, who have not so gracefully weathered the effects of aging.   Marcel himself is now an adult of at least middle age, and, as far as he is concerned, still no closer to achieving his goal of becoming a writer as he was in his youth.  He has, however, started writing articles and comes to realize, as he reflects on the course of his life, that the intricate web of contacts he has made can serve as grist for his literary mill, should he decide in his waning days to take up a pen and make some contribution to letters.  And, of course, over the past four thousand pages that is exactly what his author has done.  Marcel muses on Time (capitalization intended), memory, and dreams as necessary elements in the creation of art, a product of so much personal pain and suffering that death can seem like a welcome reprieve.  Judging the novel as a whole now that I've finished all six volumes, I affirm that there is nothing like it, or even close to it, in literature; like ""Moby Dick"" or ""Don Quixote"" it resides in its own impenetrable legendary world of oneness.  In my review of ""Swann's Way,"" I compared Proust to Henry James, but I see now that I was way off the mark.  James writes like he's throwing his weight around, imperiously demanding intellectual respect and forcing his reader into submission with his intentionally inscrutable compositions; Proust's prose, conversely, calmly and warmly invites the reader into Marcel's society and caresses him with the most delicate sensations and deepest emotions.  Proust is closer to Henry Adams than he is to Henry James, but even this attempted juxtaposition is buffered by a wide margin. Proust's style is so ornate that it is the most difficult of any writer's to describe, yet paradoxically there is nothing affected about it; he is quite possibly the most unpretentious writer in literature.  He never tries to impress the reader with his erudition, even though he evidently has much, or make himself out to be something he's not; one gets the sense that what he writes is exactly what and how he thinks, as incredible as that seems.  He uses humor without trying to be a comedian, sorrow without trying to be a tragedian.  He is employing language simply to illustrate life and the world, and I think language has no higher calling than that.  ",1

Through an absorbing analysis of the Biblical narrative, Borgman shows us that Genesis reveals truth in the way that all great literature reveals truth: through relationships.

"I just finished writing a review for the Rush Hour Cook's Weekly Wonders by Brook Noel, who is actually, Wendy Louises' daughter. My friend saw the two do a cooking demo at a packed stage at Taste of Home. He bought autographed copies of both books for me. I am in charge the dinner hour in our home. I work first shift, so much to my wife's dismay, I get to handle the dinner duties. While I'll admit I am not a gourmet cook (okay, macaroni is tough) I have been getting the &quot;thumbs up&quot; as of late by cooking with these books. What I love about Wendy's book is that these meals are SO SIMPLE yet so mouth-watering-good. I had tried another well-known slow cooker cookbook and was very disappointed with the results. I was a bit nervous about trying again, but courage prevailed. I'm glad it did as is everyone at our dinner table. I read the other reviews before posting mine and saw comments about about the print quality. Like other readers, my book was absolutely fine. Very odd. I agree too that the large font and one recipes per page is an added bonus to the nice layout and design of this book",1

"After having read Respect for Acting, I had discovered that Ms Hagen had  written another book.  Immediately I went out and bought it.  While I found  it every bit as fascinating as the first I must say a lot of it is repeats  from the first book.  Even some of the wording is the same.  That said, it  is still a wonderful read.  her ideas are more concise, her craft more  honed, and her expansion well worth the cover price.  I especially liked  the first chapter where she discusses The Actor's World.  Here she goes  into a bit of history we all would be better off to know, and she tells a  little more about herself.  When she talks about the McCarthy hearings, and  in particular her radio speecah afterwards, I was moved to tears.

"Ever since a delusional friend told me that I would be very impressed by The Female Eunuch, I have wondered why Greer seems to attract so much admiration.  I read most of her books, attempting to discover the attraction.  (I gave up after the dreadful Daddy We Hardly Knew Ye.)  I would suggest that the reader who wants to see her at her best read the appropriately named The Mad Woman's Underclothes.  Her earlier essays are witty, incisive and clever.  The quality does deteriorate as the book goes on, but at least I had some insight into what people admire.  I read this biography hoping to understand Greer's admirers; I still don't but perhaps that isn't Wallace's fault.It is always difficult to ascertain how accurate biographical material is unless there is a lot of it to be compared.   Therefore, I cannot say if Christine Wallace is accurate and insightful, but I will say that my readings of Greer's works make this biography very plausible.  I was actually a trifle surprised that other reviewers described Wallace as hostile: I thought she was kinder than Greer deserved.   Sometimes when a subject comes across poorly, it is because of their own flaws, not the biographer's.   Wallace actually admired a number of things about Greer: she thinks that The Female Eunuch was a powerful book, even if she did think that Greer was cashing in on the times.  She admires her defiance of convention in her college days, remarks on her intelligence, her creativity and her talent for acting.As for the charges that Greer is hypocritical, inconsistent, and tells wildly variant versions of her life, I can only suggest that the reader consult Greer's own work.   Her thought is rather warped by mother-blaming and the conviction that in any society other than what I'll call Western-Industrial, all children are loved and well treated.  How bad a mother was Mrs. Greer?   Extremely abusive and probably mental ill, according to her daughter's writings, but Wallace says that Greer now denies that she was abused.  Greer wants women in the Western-Industrial cultures to make a spectacle, particularly a sexual spectacle of themselves, while admiring the modesty of traditional cultures.Greer is the woman, who in The Female Eunuch, so admired close-knit Italian family life that she wanted to buy a farm and leave her child(ren) to be raised in Italy by her tenants, while she continued to live her sophisticated life in England.   (She has denied this, but I read the book.)  She doesn't seem to care to live by her own convictions, or I suppose that she would be living in an arranged marriage in her beloved India.  She wondered, I believe it was in Daddy We Hardly Knew Ye, why Australians thought that she doesn't like them.   My guess would be that they read her earlier books.   A case can be made for many of the points that Greer raises, but taken altogether she is incoherent.I don't sympathize with Greer's claims that this book has invaded her privacy.  Even a public person has the moral, if not legal right to withdraw into privacy, but Wallace is not like the papparazzi muscling their way in.   In most cases, Wallace has relied on Greer's own writings, interviews and public comments - it's not an invasion of privacy to comment on public materials.   Her interviews with other people are chiefly about subjects that Greer herself made public.  It is not as if Greer has sent her books out into the world while trying to live an otherwise retired life.   She has gone to great lengths to make herself a provocative public figure.   Those who participate in the brawl, excuse me, marketplace of ideas, have to accept the right of others to respond",1
"I loved this one.  It is very, very well written, cute and thoughtful story and the art work is some of the best I have seen in this particular genre.  The kids I read it to in school love it (and that is really what counts in children's literature, isn't it?) and it is fun for adults to read also.  There are several lesson taught in the story and the characters are quite appealing.

"People say this all the time, but this book really changed my life. Assata's willingness to confront ""fairy tale history"" has opened my eyes to a whole new way of looking at the U.S. I don't know why the above reviewer felt that Assata was admitting guilt. It was clear both from the forward by Lennox Hinds and from her own prose that Assata and her comrades were framed and targetted. The difference between Assata and others is that she speaks in uncomprimising blunt terms about the uneven targetting of blacks in the American judiciary system. This kind of railroading happens even today. Her poetry is a treat. I wish I had read this book fifteen years ago. Read this book, open your eyes, and empower yourself.",1
"This is a collection of balls to the wall garage rock. Twelve of these tracks fall from the albums, While You Were Out and Made to Be Broken. What separates Soul Asylum from the rest of their counterparts is the lyrical stitching that makes every song interesting and everything but cliche' (despite the titles- you have to have catchy titles) Boring repetition and rehashed four-chord progressions NEED NOT APPLY. Over the years this band has captured every quality rock and roll ever had to offer. Each song has at least one surprising change and takes you somewhere unexpected. Aside from reverb, these guys have no noticible production enhancement on their first 6 albums. Minus the ringing ears, this is what they sound like live. Ship of fools, Miracle Mile, and Carry On are high points. Buy their entire collection. Aside from Zeppelin and the Beatles, I can think of no other band with so many albums I could listen to straight through. It's never to late to discover Soul Asylum and there's no better way to start than with this collection. If you're looking for the songs you heard on the radio in the early 90's, buy Grave Dancer's Union and Let Your Dim Light Shine - they're well produced and rock just as well",0
"I generally refrain from writing reviews unless I feel I have more to say than, ""This is fantastic."" But, well, ""This is FANTASTIC!"" (Does emphasis count as more?) The cuts on this collection bear little resemblance to what passes for hip hop in today's mainstream. The things that make Ja Rule, Jadakiss, and Jay-Z platinum sellers are conspicuously and completely absent from this record. (Remember records?) For anyone looking for a taste of, as the title indicates, hip hop classics, however, this album is perfectly put together. Running the gamut from the hardcore East Coast classic opener ""Eric B. Is President"" to Too Short's ridiculously-enjoyable-for-something-so-ridiculous ""Freaky Tales"", this album provides an excellent sampling of excellent beats and lyrics. As I said, I haven't much too say on it, but am convinced that the devotee will enjoy it as much as the neophyte will likely be disappointed and confused by it",0

Is it the woman next door who is a real estate dealer and wants to see the large house sold to someone who can take care of the property and raise the property values around the neighborhood?  Some Theda is not sure she is comfortable with as she lives in the same neighborhood and gentrification will put her and many of her neighbors out.  What about the prejudice behavior towards the cat lady's mentally ill son?  Would someone have killed her to keep him away from the neighborhood?

That most of the foundations of science were built by white males is a historical accident. The discoverers of deep science may have benefited from a twisted social order, but the whole world has benefited from their work.

"As much as I appreciate the intent of their book, social workers have no  place in the political process -- and, other than as citizens, they  shouldn't.  Social work is not a profession.  Social workers have sold  their souls to becomes second-rate psychotherapists.  Their advocacy days  are long over.  Schools of social work pay lip service to social justice  issues (in fact, social work organizations have not been able to define the  word &quot;justice,&quot; much to their collective embarrassment.  Social  workers should just get back to case management and leave the other work  they attempt to lawyers, policy analysts, and well-educated psychologists.  (Of course, I'm a Columbia U. Schl. of Social Wk. grad, the most unjust  school imaginable, so I'm knowledgeable and bitter",1
I was super excited to receive this book as a birthday gift and used it right away to make Creamy Raspberry Oatmeal - what a fantastic way to get oatmeal in your diet.  Of course I also had to try the dessert recipes which turned out perfectly,1
"To correct the previous reviewer's post, Dever's position on Israel is not some new ""replacement"" theology but the historic Christian understanding prior to the invent of 19th century dispensational theology. Dever views God's promises to Israel in light of a covenantal structure rather than a dispensational one. The Old Covenant completely fulfilled in Christ, must now be viewed through His fulfillment and establishment of the New. The previous poster's claims of a 7 year tribulation and millenial kingdom etc. are not to be found in Dever's book because Dever simply has a different theological lens and eschatological viewpoint than that offered by Dispensationalism.This should not cause a loss of rating, for it is not the substance of the book, rather, the book should be judged on its faithfulness to the Scriptures",1
"Right there with ""El Pan y la Sal"", this is Presuntos's best record to date. Rockish, great compositions, well played, superbly produced. From Jazz feels to classical orchestra arrangements, they master it all. If you like this great Spanish pop trio, hurry up ang get you copy of ""Postales"". Go straight to ""Jerusalem"". Then listen to all of it. Write me back...",0
Homicide Life On The Street has got to be the best police TV drama ever made. It is fantastic to be able to buy the whole series on DVD as it is released. Seasons one through seven are now available and all are definetely worth buying. The acting is superb in this series. If you like police work and true to life police drama then Homicide is for you. I give it a 5 plus rating,0
"These truly do meet my expectations for what a portable headphone should be.  They fold neatly, they sound excellent and they fit comfortably. They work great if you desire a shorter cord (extension cord is also included) for use with an ipod or minidisc that you carry in your pocket or wear on your waist or arm. I can wear these for hours without any discomfort.I previously had the Philips HS820 which were decent and also a folding design. The Sony are worth the extra price. The Philips were not as comfortable and I didn't like their folding design quite as much. But, the biggest reason is the sound quality. The Philips sounded weak. I alway had to crank my minidisc volume to nearly full volume when in a noisy environment like a health club. Not so with the Sony. The sound is much stronger and is probably at least partially due to its ability to block outside noise better. For me I think they are worth the extra $10. If price is really important to you, the Philips are not a bad choice. Its just the Sony are a nice upgrade in some of the areas I mentioned that I feel are very important for me.",0

"Want to know why Cabaret is a classic?  Just listen to this recording.  The songs are masterfully crafted and beautifully performed by a great cast, including Joel Grey, Bert Convy, Lotte Lenya, Jack Gilford, and Jill  Haworth.  Though the show has undergone numerous changes since this  recording was produced in 1966, there are still no better recordings of the  score in its original form.  This remastered version also includes a number  of fascinating bonus tracks which show what the show might have been had  things gone a little differently.  No matter what they did to it, it had to  be good, but the version we got--faithfully represented on this  recording--should be in everyone's library",0

"I have watched movies and read several books about the Titanic disaster; but, without doubt this is the very, very best I've seen.  This book explains in great detail, how things happened.  It is written in an easy to read style.  It presents numerous references and direct quotes throughout the book, as well as written testimony presented at the official enquires, so it is clearly not simply the author's spectulation.  This was one book I could not put down.  It answers important questions, such as ""Did the nearby frieghter Californian, see Titanic's distress signals; and, if so, why didn't they come to aid the striken liner?"", ""Were the engines placed in ""FULL ASTERN"" immediatley when the iceberg was sighted?"", ""Why were some of the lifeboats only half filled with passengers?"", ""Would it have been better if the Titanic hit the iceberg head-on instead of side-swiping it?"" and ""Was the Titanic excessively (and carelessly) speeding to New York in attempt to set a record?""  Every page was a pleasure!  I just cannot give it enough praise.  You won't be sorry if you buy this book",1

"This book has a strange, beautiful accreting human logic.  The whole idea of a poetical dictionary is of course absurdly grandiose, so the humility and humor in this book is welcome to balance its great intelligence and creativity.  I think this is a book you keep around your bedside, to keep consulting before and after dreams",1
"This is one of the most dynamic, positive and uplifting works I've ever read. The techniques are breathtakingly simple, and the author's presentation is wonderful in it's symmetry and depth.  Western Magick forms  the backdrop, but the information contained here should prove useful to  anyone interested in expanding their horizons.  This work is especially  valuable to those who believe that the Mind is the ultimate source of  Reality.  Also, I found Mr. Cooper's sincerity and kind words of  encouragement particularly refreshing and helpful.  His program of  self-empowerment challenges the reader to stretch beyond old and outdated  beliefs toward a fresh perspective; one that has the potential to transform  lives.  Courage and a little discipline are all that's required; I think  you'll find that this book goes a long way towards helping you find these",1
"Out of all 3 movies, I think this one is the best. It is about this Matoran named Takua who finds a mask embedded in stone and he and his friend, Jaller, have been told by the Turaga that they must find the seventh toa. When Takua realizes he is the herald, he refuses the responsibility and tells the Turaga that Jaller is the herald. When Jaller persuades Takua to join him, the Turaga assume that Jaller wants Takua to put the story on the Wall of History. They were wrong. When Makuta tells Takua that if he doesn't give the mask to him, Jaller's life would be spared. After that, Takua quit the mission altogether. When the Rahkshi cornered them, the Toa Nuva came to help. When Turahk killed Jaller, Takua put on the mask, becoming Takanuva. Then with the help of the other Toa Nuva, they built the Ussanui. Takanuva used this to break into Mangaia, Makuta's lair. This severely damaged it. Then Makuta challenged Takanuva to a game of Kolhii. When Takanuva won, Makuta was furious. Then Takanuva pulled Makuta's mask off, sending both of them into a pool of energized protodermis. This made them Takutanuva, a form of Takanuva and Makuta. Takutanuva lifted a wall, letting the Toa and Hahli out of Mangaia. He brought Jaller back to life, but this weakened him. Only Takanuva was known to survive. This movie is the best",0
This is a really good book for those of you who like to write but just can't get anything to come out right. I read it and saw an immediate improvement in my writing. I highly recommend it.,1
"I have seen Larry Lambrecht's work before in the annual ""Emerald Gems"" calendar and notecard series. Lambrecht is a world class photographer with a particular specialty in shooting Irish Golf Courses (as well as many others across the globe). Not only does Lambrecht capture a view of a spectacular golf hole through his camera lens, he also has an incredible eye for catching a moment in nature using golf landscape as a backdrop. (see page 18, 98, 114, etc.)Ireland's ""Links"" courses are built along the coast, and as such in Emerald Gems, the connection between land and sea is apparent in many of the images. Emerald Gems sits on a table in our home and is admired by guests and friends for the simple beauty of the Irish Countryside.  Be warned though, If you have an affection for the game of golf and have never been to Ireland, the images of Waterville, Old Head and Lahinch alone will have you calling a travel agent. If you don't play golf, and have never seen the coast of Ireland, you may suffer the same impulse. ",1

"  I have now bought five copies of this book over thirty years.  I never get tired of reading this wonderful blessing of a book.  Each reader can concentrate on the sections that do pertain to him or her and should just skip the sections that don't.  In this way, you will actually read it.    Perfect for reading in bite-sized portions.  Great knack for telling funny stories.  I LOVE this book, and the people who keep writing it.  P.S.: Now thoroughly up-to-date; get the 2006 edition...websites, use of net, etc., all thoroughly presented",1
"This album was mysteriously dismissed by record critics everywhere in the late 70s -- as an orchestral pop record, it could hardly be better.  Eric Carmen infuses his original songs with borrowed phrases from classical music that give them a lasting melancholy and a powerful melodic hook.  This album evokes, with best kind of urgent passion, the tender lost romance of young love (Runaway) and the wistful loss of innocence (Nowhere to Hide).  Over time, this album has developed a burnished glow, and, inexplicably, is only available on CD as an import.  A dark, romantic gorgeous album, this record also has its share of kicks -- She Did It has a lively bounce, and Take It Or Leave It again treads familiar Carmen territory, music-industry betrayal and the search for one's original voice.  Boats Against The Current has been covered by many artists, and enchantingly incorporates the simple Row Row Row Your Boat melody as its intro hook.  Buy this, you will love it.  I've never stopped playing it",0

"You may have read numerous books on World War II, but Irmgard Hunt has written an account from her viewpoint of growing up in Nazi Germany in the town of Berchtesgaden.  She describes conflicting opinions held by family members regarding Adolf Hitler and her confusion as to who and what to believe.  Was he Germany's savior or a monster to be feared?  School became something she hated due to pro Nazi teachers who indoctrinated the students and abused their authority with unnecessary corporal punishment.  One of her classmates was the son of Albert Speer while another was the son of the executed Fritz Sauckel.   Irmgard describes an experience of a fanatical pro Nazi teacher who insisted she get up in front of the class and state how proud she was that her father gave his life in the war for the Fuhrer.  Another of her teacher's appeared to be a kindly woman who gently asked whether or not one of her relatives was supporting the Fuhrer.  She hesitated in answering, but then lied that he doesn't talk about the situation.  She later found her teacher was an informant for the Gestapo, and shuddered as to how close she had come to consigning him to a concentration camp.  She also relates her uncomfortable experience of sitting on the knee of Hitler in addition to her fear of allied bombings and wondering how the Americans would treat her family members once they invaded Berchtesgaden.  This book is told from the viewpoint of a child and the fears and conflicting thoughts she had regarding the war.  The book also includes a picture of Hitler's Berghof after it was bombed along with a picture of the Eagle's Nest sitting on top one of the mountains.  The author also speaks of her beginning to challenge her mother's beliefs.  The war became tiresome and Irmgard realized she had been robbed of a significant part of her childhood.  This book is a quick read, but whether you are a grizzled veteran of World War II books or a neophyte this is a book that gives you the war from a different viewpoint ( a child).  ",1
"Now in an updated second edition, The Scandinavian is a guide for intermediate to advanced chess players concerning the Scandinavian Defense, its various strategies and tactics, and tips for using it to the fullest advantage or reacting to it. Written by John Emms, one of Britain's most well-known Grandmasters, The Scandinavian is packed cover to cover with examples and sample games, many of which are taken directly from matches between expert players, to illustrate its points. Changes made to the new second edition include revisions of personal opinion and analytical amendments, which by the author's own admittance, are so common that he elected not to highly each and every one. A superb resource for the serious chess player striving to improve.",1

"Is it the comprehensive information on running day camps? Is it the great way the book is laid out for day camp administrators of all skill levels? Or is it the CD Rom of documents to help you through the paperwork process of day camps? Answer: YES TO ALL!I have been a day camp program manager for 11 years and learned through school, job training and mostly experience. This book is not only a great ""how to"" for beginners; it acts an amazing refresher course.The content in Day Camp from Day One can ""plug-and-play"" into any day camp vehicle, be it a YMCA (where I started), or a civic day camping structure for cities (where I am currently).I recommend this book to any camp director, program director, exec, board member or church parishioner starting a day camp or starting over.Connie Coutellier is my new hero",1

"50 Facts That Should Change The World is a shocking, eye-opening look at what is really going on in the world today. The cold statistics are so severe they speak for themselves, yet each one is elaborated upon with several pages explaining why the stark reality of the statistic has come to be, and what can be done about it. Figures such as ""black men born in the US today stand a one in three chance of going to jail"" and ""children living in poverty are three times more likely to suffer a mental illness than children from wealthy families"" don't lie - and the needed efforts to change these figures would transform life as we know it, if only more people would become aware and take action.",1
"This is a huge book, but you will read it with pleasure and in much less time than you think it's possible. Some cities have a soul that reveals itself in misteries written using them as background: San Francisco and Dashiell Hammet, New York and EdMacBain, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and Garcia Roza. Now Mumbay joints them with a complex story that includes how to be a police officer in that place ( graft is part of the office and part not only of your wages, but it's your social security, because if you are disabled your fellow cops will take care of your family), how the underworld works there ( very similar to other places, but with local nuances - there are muslim dons and hindu dons ) and how functions a society were there are at least 6 languages spoken, one being english and castes are offically not recognized, but they still define who you are and were you live. And the book shows very well what means to be a woman in modern India - some in traditional roles and some trying to be modern like western women in developed societies...just trying...The thriller part is chilling and very possible, envolving dirty nuclear bombs that I'm afraid will come someday. One of the best parts of the book is it's dry, hard view of the troubles when India and Pakistan parted, viewed by a child's eyes. Again, it's much more than a mistery or a thriller; actually is one of the best presentations of what is India. Many indian words go into the text, but there is a glossary in the end and mostly of them are easily comprehended, even without a consult - mostly are explectives and those are similiar all over the world",1
"I've been listening to this albumn for about a year on and off. I've become a big fan of Blind Melon and love their other albumns yet I have to say that they just can't compare to their debut. This albumn is powerful and simply amazing. The first 5 songs are catchy and well composed with searing guitar, strong bass, steady rhythm, and Hoon's extraordinary vocals. The lyrics are well thought out and just great ""feel good"" style of funky,folky, rock. The last part of the albumn is where the real gems are however. ""Change"" feels somewhat lacking instrumentally but the lyrics and emotion make this beautiful song one of BM's best.  ""Deserted"" is an extremely powerful song that will leave you in awe. ""Holyman"" has some of the albums best guitar work. ""Sleepyhouse"" along with ""Time"" is probably the albumns best all-around song-with heartfelt lyrics and fresh interesting compositions. ""Drive"" is a great song with the albumns best vocals. ""Blind Melon"" has a song for evey mood. From mellow and deep to intense feel good rock and roll this albumn will blow you away. I'd give it ten stars if I could",0

"Rife with cliches and no spins on old jokes, there are few laughs in this book.  The sample pages above are perfect examples for the (lack of) tone and style to the humor. Basically, they'll throw anything at the wall to see if it'll stick. It's extremely uneven and as such comes off as offensive. Even the cover is more offensive than it is funny.These guys have NO love for being Jewish...they're ashamed of it. Which is made clear in the first few pages.The Christmas vs. Chanukah piece above was actually the one I flipped to first at the store...sadly, they think saying ""none"" or ""nothing"" over and over is funny.  Of COURSE Jews have a Chanukah symbol...Adam Sandler! Not only (sadly) true, but a much funnier answer than any they've got.Shame...it's a great concept, but it needed the mature, clever writing of the Daily Show writers' ""America"" book to pull it off. Just like someone else here on this page says, they tried to rip that off, except they forgot A) a concept and B) the funny.",1
"Dover editions provide the basic poetic texts without serious and extended commentary. In a sense there is an advantage in this as it encourages the reader to engage the text, and seek understanding through reading and rereading. But there is also a great disadvantage especially when it comes to complicated poetry like that of the Metaphysicals whose complex linking of diverse images , whose intellectual toughness requires explanation. Nonetheless there is great poetry here at the usual Dover very reasonable price. As for the Metaphysicals themselves Donne is of course at the center. But there is also great poetry from Herbert and Marvell. This is a poetry in which the heart is very much in the mind, and one must have a strong intellect to understand.I know the challenge and delight of this poetry, and also understand how many readers find it most fascinating and great.( As did T.S. Eliot) But I nonetheless find my own heart and mind better expressed, reflected and uplifted in the Romantics (Wordsworth especially) who will come later",1
"I got this for my 6 year old daughter who loves fairies and mermaids.  The art projects are awesome, many different ways to create, each project can take around an hour to do.

"Cherie Calbom has written the book I have been waiting for.  Because of my concern about nutritionally sound weight loss and wholistic health, I wanted to have a book that encompassed each of these areas.  As a biologist who has pursued health and nutrition for most of my life, I've tried many of the popular diet programs throughout the years. Many of them work for a while, yet do not provide long-term health benefits or are damaging to the body over time.  I was introduced to the benefits of coconut oil before I read this book, and they are indeed wide-ranging---coconut oil added to the diet increases health and wellness. However, most of the people I have coached need a clear path to run on.  This book provides that pathway by giving clear instructions that can work for anyone, regardless of where they started or what they know.  The book has a programmed pathway to effective weight loss, as well as instructions on how to restore the body to the health we were all created to enjoy. Many people I know have reported excellent results after only a short time, not only with weight loss, but also with increased energy and a sense of well-being. For those with atherosclerosis, liver congestion, high cholesterol, or other serious problems, Cherie's Phase II Liver Cleanse can help the body restore health when properly followed.  The book is fun to read, has great recipes, plus guidance for overcoming obstacles to weight loss, including emotional issues. I was especially impressed with the sections on blood sugar imbalances, thyroid problems, and candida, which have been a challenge for me personally as well as many of the people I coach. I highly recommend it.",1

"This book is at once thorough, brief, and concise.  This is by far the best technical books i've read on any subject.I have been interested in Zope for almost a year now, but even as a seasoned programmer I was intimidated by its labrythian complexity.  I struggled for weeks reading the free Zope material and learning almost nothing.  This book presents the material in an accessable manner while shying away from the horrible puns and awful jokes present in so many technical books.  This book would be a bargin at twice its price.Even the books physical construction is outstanding -- it is a hard back with a solid binding, and the cover appears to be some sort of tyvek which is an industrial material you may recognize as the nearly indestructable plastic the US Postal Service uses in some of its mailers.  For the older among us, you would recall the material being used as 5.25"" floppy sleeves.A last note, another reviewer mentions having trouble getting the book in the US, I recieved it in about a week with the standard free shipping",1
"I borrowed this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and after reading the reviews about it, I wasn't quite sure how I would feel about it. After watching it, I have to say that I LOVE this movie and bought it the next day. Regardless of what critics have written, I loved that they were able to get most of the original cast members to play the roles that made RENT a success. Yes, they are supposed to be in their 20's in the play but really, I barely noticed or frankly, could've cared less.  I love Jesse L. Martin and he was fantastic. Idina Menzel's voice is super and was ever surprised that Rosario Dawson could sing. Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Tracie Thoms were great as well. Yes they changed and omitted things that are in the Broadway play, but if you are truelly a fan of RENT, you will overlook that and just enjoy the one thing that is always present: the wonderful songs!

As someone who loves the outdoors, I  thought _Annapurna: A Woman's Place_ would be a good place to start.  I was  not disappointed.  Told in a straightforward, autobiographical manner  without a lot of embellishment, this book was none-the-less fascinating.  I  found it very difficult to put down, and I constantly wanted to know what  happened next. I was surprised that Ms. Blum stressed the climbing aspect  of her team's adventure and actually downplayed the fact that they were a  FEMALE climbing team, but I found this added to the appeal of her story.   This is one of the few books I will unhesitatingly recommend to family  &amp; friends",1

"It is the near future and we have arrived at/discovered/created/evolved  (however you say it) the Singulatiry, the conscious, non-biological intelligence calle the Eschaton that mere humans can but hope to comprehend. With its godlike powers, the Eschaton seems almost divine in nature. But even a God has worries and in this case it's a version of faster than light travel that effectively becomes time travel (through a slight of hand reliance on the Heisenberg ""observation"" experiment). For if time travel is possible, then someone can go to the distant past and set in motion events to destroy the Eschaton.  Therefore, that entity has established some basic game rules - Thou Shalt Not Violate Causality in the Past.  The consequences for such an action range from technological changes to expulsion to planetary destruction. In SINGULARITY we meet Martin, secret agent for the Eschaton, and Rachel, UN Black Op spy who fall in love while seeking to prevent the destruction of the New Republic for violating the sacred law. This is an old-fashioned space opera with drama, romance, action and the incredible world of nanotechnology, genetic modification and smart materials. They save the planet and marry in time for the next adventure, IRON SUNRISE. This is such an incredible piece of writing - the story, the humor, the science and research are just amazing.

"Any STAR TREK fan will enjoy this series very much. Won't go into details right now about the series. Wanted to say something about the plastic containers that hold the DVD's. At least with my set, in Season 1, I found a circular deformity in the plastc sleeves that separate the DVD's. This was pressing up against the playing side of the DVD's. These could have easily scratched the playing sides and rendered them useless. You cannot remove the deformity. But, by turning the DVD's over so the back side of the DVD's rest against the deformity will solve the problem. If you buy the set I strongly recommend going thru and checking all the cases and reversing the DVD's where necessary. Otherwise, ENJOY THE ADVENTURE!",0
"All the world, in every social class, is simply a Vanity Fair, where people compete for money, power and status. Like Thackeray rightly says, hypocrisy is the main cement keeping society whole. If we told the truth to each other all the time, we couldn't live together. Our homes would be caves, there would be no parties and many businessmen would go broke. On the contrary, though we all speak ill of all the rest, we frequent and tolerate each other. This book is a treatise on worldly philosophy, cynical but profoundly realistic.Becky Sharp and Amelia Sedley leave Miss Pinkerton's school for young ladies and go out into Vanity Fair. Their baggage is different: Amelia, rich, is too good and passive; Becky, poor and orphaned, is totally selfish, amoral and cynical. To live in this world she's prepared; she's armed and dangerous. She's very beautiful and a great actress. She's the perfect social climber. Amelia invites her to spend a few days with her, during which Becky tries to seduce Amelia's brother Jos into marriage, but fails thanks to Amelia's fiancee. Although she can't marry the fat, fool and proud Jos, he never forgets her. So Becky has to go as governess to a rural manor called Queen's Crawley, where the boss is the old, degenerate, and corrupt Sir Pitt Crawley, with whose second son, Rawdon, Becky will eventually marry, after many adventures and scheming. Both Rawdon and George Osborne, Amelia's fiancee, are called to fight at Waterloo, where a tragedy will happen. William Dobbin, a friend of Osborne, is in love with her but silently, and will always be her loyal friend. The years pass, and while Amelia's family sinks in poverty and disrepute, Becky climbs in the world, with morally questionable but effective methods. The ending, of course, won't be spoiled here. Under the facade of a frivolous story, kind of a soap opera, Thackeray talks to us about the way we are, of the futility of ambition and the turnarounds of life. Written with a morbid, acid and ruthless sense of humor, the author uses his novel to have a chat with us readers, question us, and reflect with us, which makes it even more enjoyable. Just when Thackeray sees the disgust in our face, he asks us: What would you have done in this situation? Do you really feel so morally superior? Do you not live in Vanity fair too?.Although the story is basically sad, it is full of life and told in so funny a way that you will laugh and take a moment to think about what you have just read. There are plenty of subplots, digressions, and asides, but all of them make sense. It is thankfully long, since a shorter book would have it hard to convey in all its power the variety of life. In few books does British wit shines so much as in this one, an epic of domestic life which honors its subtitle: ""A novel without a hero""",1
"Author Janet Sue Terry has compiled an eclectic mix of short stories that are certain to please the palette of readers of diverse tastes. Terry titillates our imagination with her offering of medieval love stories about princes and princesses, complete with fire-breathing dragons and exciting adventures.Megan Blue Terry wrote three stories for this book.  My favorite is ""Pay Your Marriage Dues,"" a touching love story of a husband and wife struggling to accept each other's reality. And if you enjoy a quick, stimulating read, Betty Dravis (that's me) is the writer for you.  I can't write much about my own works, of course, so please read my short, satirical stories of dark humor and dark horror, then judge for yourself. I hope they amuse and entertain you, as they're meant to do. Joe DeChristopher pens a story of love found, love lost, a true story that's a glowing tribute to his late wife ... a story that was very painful for him to write.  He also writes a moving tale of a Vietnam veteran who can't let go of ""ghosts from the past.""  Lori Martin paints a dark tale of death and gloom in the unusual setting of a dining room; a must read for horror fans. Dan Chatterton takes the reader on a nostalgic trip back to the sixties; boys, girls, parents ... and ""muscle"" cars, of course. Daniel Morrison pens a somber story of an overweight boy who has an obsession for a lovely girl in a poster; an intriguing mystery.  And the ""diamond in this collection of precious gems"" is a love story by Rosanna Filippello. In ""Blind Love"" she writes of a beautiful broadcast journalist who catches her boyfriend in bed with her best friend; an old storyline that becomes fresh under Filippello's masterful pen. Her twists and turns are so exciting you can't quit reading. A remarkable reading experience, as are all the gems between the covers of this book. So find a comfortable chair, and sit back and enjoy the read.""",1
"I love this mouse. I definitely feel it pays to buy a mouse that costs over $20, like this mouse, as it is worth it, because: 1.  It is sturdy.2.  I like the design.3.  It is comfortable and ergonomic.4.  It has great, sensitive tracking ability.  This mouse is (laser)light years better than the optical mouse that came with my new Dell desktop computer.  I also replaced the keyboard on my new Dell desktop computer and bought the Microsoft 4000 ergonomic USB wired keyboard, also a great product!  I personally prefer wired products, generally speaking, and this is mouse does the job great! I highly reccommend this product",0
"Mario and Luigi Partners in Time to me takes me back to the SNES, with the first Mario RPG ""Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars"" a game I absolutely love (and would also recommend to anyone with an SNES or an emulator). The reason is the general gameplay for this RPG hasn't changed. You move around different screens, attack the enemies, fight bosses, etc. There is definately a unique (and I suppose you might consider it simplistic) ideology that this game follows. It's an easier version of action/RPGs, you level up, battles aren't random (you can see the enemies you engage on screen) though it is turn-based. This game plays and feels much like the original legend of the seven stars, but has added its own twists and funny little story line to make it, it's own game.I highly recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind a lot of chatting, but even more action and puzzles! Another homerun for Mario RPGs",0
"I use this deeply touching music as easily to add a peaceful, misty background to my activities as to provide a focus for meditation.  It is also one of my favorites for use with my Healing Touch work The selection of songs and mix of artists from different cultural backgrounds is very well done; each piece is uniquely beautiful, evocative of something different, from lingering sunsets over quiet lakes to the mysteries of walking through a heavy, enfolding fog between the hills to the welcome flicker of friendly fires at night.

"Very well done stage version (in French) of ""The Tales of Hoffmann"". Excellent singing all around, and compares favorably to the 1951 film version (in English). I do think they could have tightened it up a bit, eliminating the curtain calls (necessary for a live audience, but a time-waster on DVD). The sub-titling was chaotic at best, leaving one with the impression that the sub-titlers weren't there most of the time, or didn't care to do a complete job. Nevertheless, it's well worth owning!",0
"""You have to be of a particular bent to appreciate this guy,"" or not. Maybe any kind of bent will do when you are open minded enough to read past the first paragraphs. I'm critiquing another amazon.com reviewer here, but it's really not necessary to bolster Robert Anton Wilson's reviews as there are plenty of serious accolades for Bob's books all over the Net.I've long considered ""Cosmic Trigger I"" and ""Prometheus Rising"" to be the best introductions to Bob's work, but I now have to add ""Email to the Universe"" to that list. With essays that span a period of 45 years of this remarkable writer's career, this book offers a breadth of observation and speculation guaranteed to fascinate anyone unafraid of the novelty that defines the most eccentric ideas in quantum mechanics and the most innovative inventions of the information age. As always with RAW's books, the reader is in for a wild ride.Many of us are apparently afraid of that ride. Neophopia, fear of the new, and Neophilia, love of the new, are described in Bob's essay ""Dreams of Flying"" with the typical RAW talent for presenting mind-bending examples, as in ""Cosmic Trigger,"" and panoramic elucidation as in ""Prometheus Rising.""Forgive me as I cut and paste and string together a handful of lines from several paragraphs in this essay . . .From Email To The Universe:"" . . . dreams of flying appeared in the collective unconscious before the reality of flight existed in technology, and I suspect that if we understood our dreams better we would use our technology more wisely . . . I suggest that we contemplate what our children look at every Saturday morning on TV. One of the most popular jokes in animated cartoons shows the protagonist walking off a cliff, without noticing what he has done. Sublimely ignorant, he continues to walk - on air - until he notices that he has been doing the ""impossible,"" and then he falls . . . Daedalus who, imprisoned in a labyrinth (conventional ""reality""), invented wings and flew away, over the heads of his persecutors; and Icarus, the son of Daedalus, who flew too close to the Sun Absolute and fell back to Earth. Like Porky Pig walking off a cliff, Icarus' fall contains a symbolism many have encountered in their own dreams . . . Daedalus means ""artist"" in Greek . . . Daedalus, inventor of wings that took him from Earth to Outer Space - why does he represent Art, instead of Science? . . . The genius of an artist, Aristotle says, lies in his texne, the root from which we get our word ""technology""; but texne basically means skill or craft, or the ability to make things that never existed before. Negative entropy, i.e., information . . . The musician and the architect, the poet and the physicist -- all inventors of new realities -- all such Creators may be best considered late evolutionary developments of the type that first appears as the shaman. Please remember that shamans in most cultures are known as ""they who walk in the sky,"" just like our current shaman-hero, Luke Skywalker . . . The ironies of Swift and Aristophanes, and the myths of the fall of Icarus and Donald Duck, indicate that the collective unconscious contains a force opposed to our dreams of flight. This appears inevitable . . . But what if we begin to regrow healthy organs of Poetic Imagination and flight? What if we ""put on wings and arouse the coiled splendor within,"" as Liber Al urges? . . . Joyce did not name his emblematic Artist merely Daedalus, but Stephen Daedalus -- after St. Stephen the Protomartyr, who reported a Vision and was stoned to death for it . . . Those of us who have no avocation for martyrdom must learn, when we realize how much neophobia remains built into the contraptions of ""society"" and ""the State,"" the art of surviving in spite of them. In a word, we must ""get wise"" in both the Socratic meaning of the phrase and in the most hardboiled street meaning. Neophobia functions as an Evolutionary Driver, forcing the neophiliac to get very smart very fast.""~~~~~Forgive me, Bob, for condensing a ten page essay into one, your writing deserves savoring, but allow me in this little exercise to bring a taste of your work to both the neophiliacs and neophobiacs visiting amazon.com who may be unaware of your gifts",1
"These are the books I grew up with-small books that contained wonderful pictures.  I read them to my own children, and they in turn are reading them to their children.  Rev. Audry's pictures have a charm lost in the present day Thomas The Train tv series.These stories benefit from Rev. Audry's original illustrations.  These stories are gentle and amusing .In a sometimes cold world , they invite you in to the gentler, kinder, and infinitely warmer Earth celebrated in these stories . Thomas the Tank Engine, Gordon and many others live on in these stories.  My father was a railroad buff- so I suppose it was natural that I should have enjoyed these stories so much.

But if you just kick back, relax, and watch the damn movie, you'll enjoy it.

"Woot!This album is great. For those that heard this and know anything about skills in mixing and in making a good mix knows that this should be on your hall of fame.I don't like my music with vocals when I listen to trance.I like my trance with great beats (Tranceport, Voyage Into Trance)So I consider trance with vocals ""gay music"" cause mostly those female vocals be killing the originality of trance.But this is just great, even though a lot of female vocals are here, I still love this. He also does a good job on switching from trance-only to trance-vocals.All these songs easily can get a 5 out of 5 or up(except for the one of Calling Your Name).YOU REALLY WILL BE LEFT IN SEARCH OF SUNRISE after this album ends. I like listening to this album when the sun rises and/or sets.With a great blend of vocals and trance maybe people that listen to (pop, dance, and R&B) will want to listen to some actual trance.Verdict: 7.5 out of 5.0 Its sooo good you need to get its A LOT better than the other 3 ISOS he has made. He really changed the way of my thoughts about ""gay music"". Well this is simply a must get!! What The Hell(WTH) you doing reading this review! Go buy it in stores! NOW!P.S.

"in November 1978, Olivia Newton-John released ""Totally Hot""BEFORE:Australia's girl-next-door Olivia Newton-John became Hollywood's golden girl less than six months earlier with Grease.  In which, she shed her wholesome image at the end when she became Sandy #2, clad in black leather and a perm.  Olivia was not just hot again, she was also a sex symbol.   Her upcoming album would be a shift in sound as well as a continuation of the ""new"" Olivia.AFTER:Totally Hot became Olivia's first studio album since Have You Never Been Mellow to make the top 10.   A Little More Love was a #3 single and Deeper Than The Night topped at #11.   Totally Hot would also be Olivia's last hit album on the country charts until 1998's Back With A Heart.In the 70's, Olivia had a string of hits with generally inoffensive pop ditties, such as ""Something Better To Do"", ""Don't Stop Believing"" and ""I Honestly Love You"".   However, many of the albums were generally spotty.   Totally Hot was not only a new style for Olivia, but also her first great album.Totally Hot represents a vast number of stylings for Olivia.    We get country (Dancing Round And Round), pop music (Deeper Than The Night), disco (Totally Hot), rock and roll (Gimme Some Lovin') and crosses between.The opening track ""Please Don't Keep Me Waiting"" is a sign that this is not your mothers' Olivia.  Running nearly 6 minutes, the song is one that is must be heard.  Olivia wails towards the end and it's brilliant.Other standouts on the album include ""A Little More Love"", which was a top 5 hit in 1979.   The sexy ""Talk To Me"".  The rocking remake of ""Gimme Some Loving"".This cd is available on import only,  come on Universally, reissue it stateside",0
"Washington investigative journalist Daniel Greenberg fills the 500 pages of this book with stories of how science puts material concerns ahead of ethical concerns, resulting in that which is not always in the best interests of society. Indeed, ethical erosion in science, with a corresponding abdication of social responsibility, seems to be inversely related to the chase for money. For many scientists, the pursuit of money has become the primary motivation, with concern for the moral and social good largely ignored.Science can be funded from governments, from industry, and from universities. Of course those who supply the cash flow can determine the type of research and in many respects the outcome of the research. One just has to think of the enormous budget given over to AIDS research, while other less glamorous (and less politically correct) diseases go begging for funding.The life sciences (medicine, biotechnology, pharmacology, etc.) is a good case in point. For example, pharmaceutical firms often misrepresent and inflate scientific data for regulatory approval, and to influence physicians to prescribe their products to an unwitting public. One way to achieve this end is to duplicate publication of experimental data to give the impression of widespread scientific backing.Greenberg offers other examples of bad ethics in human experimentation, and notes how the biomedical research community was aware of gross inadequacies in monitoring scientific experimentation and quite content to let the situation remain that way. The examples demonstrate that what is done in the name of science often seems to be above regulation, accountability and ethical review. And it is not just science that gets tainted with money and corporate influence, but knowledge as a whole. Thus corporate greed and the limitless pursuit of profit seem to negatively effect everyone within reach, and it is not scientific objectivity alone that suffers, but learning as well. No wonder why certain bioethical debates seems to be so one-sided. The recent stem cell debate is just one example where Big Biotech is buying its way into science and the media, regardless of the outcome for the rest of society.And Greenberg notes how the popular press acts mainly as a puppet of science, especially biomedical research. It routinely pumps out what is told to, without asking the hard questions it does of politicians and others. This is indeed the case with reports of scientific-medical progress. Greenberg calls this ""may"" journalism. Stem cells may do this. Cloning may do that. Gene therapy may deliver the goods. We are wowed by reports of potential medical breakthroughs, but they are just that: potential. However, the way the media presents them, it seems like a cure for Parkinson's disease will arrive next week. Thus we find a collusion between certain scientists, various industries (eg., the Biotech industry), and a gullible and/or subservient media.And of course this collusion acts as a giant feed-back loop. Journalists need good news stories, and scientists and the corporations need people to think they are just on the verge of a major medical breakthrough, if only a bit more funding were forthcoming. The one feeds of the other, and a disease-weary public, believing that immortality is just around the corner, will go along with it. And governments also get into the act, claiming that if we over-regulate things like cloning or stem cell research, all the research will move interstate or overseas, leaving them behind. So there is a grand mingling of state, corporate and public interests taking place, making it even harder for science to claim any sort of neutrality and objectivity.If religious leaders and politicians today are subject to intense scrutiny and ethical appraisal (and rightly so), then perhaps it is time to extend the same treatment to scientists. And one place to begin is by reading this important and timely book.",1

"This was an appropriate conclusion to Shakespeare's career. Not only are the characters such as Henry VIII, Cranmer, and Wolsey convincing, but the poetry and images are beautiful. In addition, through the fall of several  characters such as Wolsey, we can see reflections of Shakespeare himself as  he wrote his 37th and final play. It is also poetically appropriate that  one of the greatest writers England ever knew ended his career by writing a  play about one of the greatest kings that England ever knew! I DO NOT  believe that Shakespeare only wrote parts of this play as many people do.  With the beautiful images, poetry, and captivating characters, I am very  confident in the belief that this play was written entirely by the one and  only William Shakespeare",1
"It's hard to imagine an author covering the 1800 election, the Marbury v. Madison Supreme Court decision, and several other topics that this book treats and coming up with something coherent. But Ackerman does just that. I came to this book after reading another book by the same author dealing with the nomination, election, and assassination of James Garfield (""Dark Horse,"" reviewed by me earlier) and I am impressed by Ackerman's ability to write a book on political history that is almost impossible to put down. He puts in all sorts of information that is essential for a modern reader to follow the happenings of a different era with understanding, while never letting his writing become too tedious.The Constitution was not written with an eye toward the political party system that soon developed, and the constitutional mechanism for election of the Presidency soon developed obvious flaws as soon as Washington retired. Ackerman does not go much into the 1796 election, which already unmasked problems (leading to a President and Vice-President of opposite parties) but begins with the 1800 election, which almost led to a total breakdown. The main thrust of the book is that out of this election and the ensuing competition between Federalist ideas of the Constitution (exemplified by John Marshall in the Chief Justiceship) and the ideas of Jefferson and his allies (especially James Madison) came a synthesis which has lasted. And I think that to a large extent he makes his case.I do want to say that another reviewer's comment that Ackerman overly adulates Jefferson and denigrates Marshall does not appear to me to be the case. He points out errors made by both men, though he says at one point that a selfish action made by Jefferson as President of the Senate probably had consequences that were in the nation's best interest, and that may be what the reviewer had in mind. I think the book is actually rather balanced. ",1

"PLEASE KILL ME - something from a t-shirt of the day:  Imagine walking around a pre-gentrification Manhattan in this?  PLEASE KILL ME - an oral history of punk as it evolved in NYC (one of its' real points of origin, along with Detroit) was a long time in the making, and was ultimately well worth the wait.This book is drawn from interviews with all of the key players, and the avalanche of historical detail presented here is far greater than anyone could've hoped for - to say that this book rewards re-reads would be a great understatement.  There's years of material for further exploration on offer here.The nearly apocalyptic debauchery of the years is luridly detailed, but so also is the creative process and the working methods, and the diversity of the initial scene (something that unfortunately faded from punk into the 1980s) is also vividly depicted.A great and rich read.-David Alsto",1

The chapter dedicated to acquiring rental property covers financing and loans, various types of mortgage loans, other types of finance, and what to look for during a pre-purchase inspection.  The chapter also stresses the importance of finding the right real estate agent, lawyer, accountant, and financial advisor.	Also included with the purchase of the book is a CD-ROM featuring pre-written forms, agreements, letters, and legal notices.   Samples of the documents are also included in the book, such as a tenant information letter and a rental agreement violation letter.

"This is one of the most horrifying, heartbreaking stories I have ever seen. There are a lot of reviewers here who contest the authenticity of the storyline, but even if what is depicted is even remotely true, here is a life that no-one deserves. I don't agree with a lot of what Jessica Lange has to say, but I have tremendous respect for her acting ability. Her portrayal of an unbalanced, threatened, hounded woman, is without peer. In this film, she portrays the film star Frances Farmer, showing a very controversial, headstrong woman, a no-no in the day of Farmer's rise and fall. Attacking a hairdresser, being pulled over by the police, then attacking a police officer, and being convicted of Contempt of Court, yes, she needed to learn a lesson. But people in authority don't like people who make waves. The story follows her life, so to speak, through some rough times, some happier times, and, what I would call one of the saddest, most frustrating, completely horrifying things to happen to somebody. She's happy, she knows what she wants, and is ready to begin anew, without Hollyweird. The typical stage-mother sees this as a bad idea, and a fight ensues. Since she was stripped of her legal rights as an adult, her mother's decisions count, not hers, and in one of the most vicious things one could do to another person, commits Frances to a mental intstitution a second time. Seeing her sitting there, remembering her life when it was better, in a crowded mental infirmary, surrounded with the dregs of society, drugged, hair chopped off, restrained, tied down and raped, this is an excruciating scene to watch. As with the Ice-Pick Lobotomy. Detractors of this film say this didn't happen to her, but it DOES happen. Or, at the very least, it did happen to people. Like an earlier scene, where the doctors strapped her to a bed, and injected her full of Insulin, telling her it was a tranquilizer. Watching convulsions isn't a pleasant experience, and having one, I can't imagine. The written narration at the end of the film says, ""She died as she lived: Alone.""Yes, this is one brutal film, one that can leave a viewer exhausted, physically, as well as emotionally, and will stay with you for a very long time, knowing how people tend to treat someone who is a little ""different.",0

"Tim O'Brien was born in heart of bluegrass music country, in Wheeling West Virginia, in 1954. And in 1970, he moved to Colorado and moved into professional music. The rest, as they say, is history. He's a master of the guitar, the fiddle, the mandolin, and other instruments, and he produces some of the greatest bluegrass music made today.This album is another in a long list of Tim O'Brien's works of art, and it is just as good as his others. The songs are a fine selection of Appalachian and Scots-Irish tunes, carrying the listener back and forth across space and time. I loved Pretty Fair Maid In The Garden and Foreign Lander, and really loved the musical numbers Land's End/Chasin' Talon and First Snow.Overall, I found this to be a great album, and have listened to it over and over again. If you like the sound of great bluegrass music, then you will like this CD - I sure know I did! I give this CD my highest recommendations",0
"Unfortunately, this book misses the mark and is of little value.  Some of the information on the making of the documentary might be of remote interest to those interested in such things but the author is too enmeshed in the politics of the present and therefore fails to shed light on the past. For that reason, this book will probably have more value many years from now as people look back at the politics of the battlefield in the 1990s but even with that, it is limited as it lacks objectivity. My hardback edition has nice maps on the inside covers and a nice layout of photographs but that is hardly a reason to buy this book. For those interested in Indian primary source accounts on the Little Big Horn as a means of better understanding them and the battle, see the following:W.A. Graham, THE CUSTER MYTH, a classic, no Custer library is complete without it.Greg Michno, LAKOTA NOON, c. 1997, an excellent effort at bringing about a coherent synthesis of testimony and matching it to a plausible timeline of events.  Testimony summarzied and augmented by an excellent narrative that keeps everything on track.  Maps galore that are highly useful. Walter Camp, CUSTER IN 76, contains his notes on various interviews he conducted with Indian as well as soldier survivors.Richard Hardorff and his numerous and excellent books that contribute to our knowledge, especially CHEYENNE MEMORIES OF THE CUSTER FIGHT; LAKOTA RECOLLECTIONS OF THE CUSTER FIGHT; INDIAN VIEWS OF THE CUSTER FIGHT.  With the recent placement of markers appproximating the places where Lakota and Cheyenne warriors fell, his book entitled HOKAHEY! INDIAN CASUALTIES OF THE CUSTER FIGHT is essential to have when visiting the battlefield.",1

"When I read Jim Marion's first book, 'Putting On the Mind of Christ', I felt as if I had finally found someone who could help an agnostic kid who had stumbled upon nondual consciousness find the common ground between modern (often incomprehensible) Christianity and his own mystical experiences.  Thanks to Marion, for the first time in my life the Bible reflected back my own worldview.  No small task, to be sure.  His first work was refreshing and its impact quite groundbreaking for me.'The Death of the Mythic God' is the continuation of Marion's bold journey into his own spiritual truth, though it's a truth that is available to us all.  In this smaller tome, he explains his observations and beliefs in the simplest of terms, the true sign of a gifted teacher with much to say.Marion believes that it's time we retire the concept of the mythic god who lives up above the clouds, separate from His creation, doling out rewards and punishments upon a predominantly sinning and rebellious populace.  This belief was really only a reflection of the collective consciousness of earlier times and cultures, he contends.  We are now mature and intelligent enough, however, to really investigate humanity's unshakable belief in a higher power.  It can never be repeated enough that this higher power is, as odd as it may first sound, at the very core of our own being.  (His beliefs and my own.)Since I was so thrilled to find his first book, this review is assuredly not very neutral in tone.  But if you have a mind that is open enough to realize that the path to spiritual maturity (even enlightenment) begins with the very first question you pose of your culture's ingrained religious belief system, then you will find a very exciting and safe world to explore within these pages.  I highly recommend this book to any curious and seeking soul.  Although my own path to meeting the God within was different than Marion's, it's almost eerie that much of what he writes parallels my own thoughts and experiences.  Therein lies the proof I need that 'Death of the Mythic God' is built upon a very sturdy and Truthful foundation",1
"No stars should be an option!  I picked this out of someone's trash bag on the sidewalk.  Which should have told me something about it, but I needed something to read on the bus.  Reading this was like settling for a candy bar you ""kind of"" like - you eat it, but it's not what you really want and it doesn't satisfy you.  I found it stupid, boring and pointless.  I threw it back into a trash bag when I finished it (yes, I finished it - once I start a book, I have to finish it).  I am not inclined to read anything else by her - I refuse to call her an author, because she can't write. ",1

"If you work for a large corporation which has millions of $ to spend on DW projects, maybe you should look at this book and even consider some of the ideas that it contains.But if you need to develop a data warehouse using limited resources and within a certain timeframe, your time will better used reading other books, because following the Inmon approach will lead you to an unnecessary complicated and expensive design.I found that the arguments used by Inmon to demonstrate the limits of the dimensional approach are not convincing at all. For example, at page 142 he says ""Because there is a different data structure for each data mart, making any data mart into a data warehouse doesn't make sense.""Having personally implemented several data warehouses using the ""conformed dimensions"" approach, I can guarantee that it worked and produced a very elegant and clean data model.",1

"   When I serendipitously discovered this book at a local book store, I knew it was going to have an impact. When I began reading the first few pages I was immediately thrilled and deeply moved by how this book grappled with some of the same core issues of spirituality and the practical realities of the world that I have dealt with all my life. (I'm 48 years old.) I eagerly looked forward to reading this book every night for the next couple of weeks, both for the fascinating information it provides, the dilemmas it explores, and because it put me in a profound and thoughtful space, feeling my own warrior energy and intentions.    I read the Amazon reviews before starting this book so I was watching for examples of some of their critical points--which are nonexistant. I wanted to write a rave review of this book right away, but felt as a matter of integrity I should read the whole thing first, and having done so to the very end, I am even more puzzled by the erroneous statements some ""reviewers"" made (which have been addressed by other customer comments). It's too bad that ""reviews"" by a couple of deadbeats with an obvious chip on their shoulder has brought down the customer average for this book, which rightfully should be AT LEAST in the four-and-a-half star range.    Anyone who actually reads this book knows that the Trojan Warrior Project (the subject of this book) was a complete success on all accounts. The author is honest all along about his own fears and doubts--and failures--giving the book an inspiring authenticity and making the successes all the more impressive. Strozzi-Heckler is quite forthright near the end of the book in stating (from the after-project report and evaluations) that one-third of the participants did not find the program valuable. Anecdotal evidence over the next several years seems to counterbalance this partial ""failure"" with many of the participants later appreciating the long-term benefits of the program to all aspects of their lives. And of course the fact that a version of this program has now (as of 2000) been incorporated into an ONGOING aspect of Marine training is the ultimate proof of its success.    I could quible about some of the little things that keep this book from being a perfect masterpiece (epics always seem to be judged more harshly by film critics than little movies). The author's character descriptions are sometimes corny in reaching for either colorful metaphor or character by analogy to movie cliches. The epilogue section goes on too long: Although the follow-up information is certainly valuable and fascinating, Strozzi-Heckler could have used a more assertive editor (for both editions). The lengthy afterword section wanders a bit and keeps the book from closing on a tight note. The biggest problem from a literary POV is that it's hard to keep all the characters straight, which makes it difficult to get a cumulative sense of the different participants (i.e., on the Special Forces teams), so it was hard for me as a reader to share the author's developing relationships with these men. But these are quibbles.    ""In Search of the Warrior Spirit"" is one of the most thought-provoking and enjoyable books I have ever read. Strozzi-Heckler's skill as a writer lets him get away with writing in a daily journal style that could easily have come off as contrived. Here, the reader is engaged with both the events and the idealogical information and struggles that are presented. About half way through reading this book I got on-line, looked up the nearest Aikido center in my town, and started taking lessons the next day. And still am.    I've subsequently ordered about fifteen other books on Aikido and on warrior virtues. Like the nature of Aikido moves, this book has propelled my life in a direction it was already going, more than I realized. I'm charged. And grateful.",1
"I thought my JVC Digital Camera was handy, easy to use and worked pretty well for what it was... then one day at my daughter's ballet show, I turned it on (I made sure I charged it all night) and it wouldn't record.

"I used this textbook in a lower-level undergrad course in biology.  It is fantastic.  The explanations are very concise, and the illustrations make the material much easier to understand.

Get this book - you won't regret it",1
"First issue arrived today. After tearing up  8 or 9 insert ads which made it difficult to read the magazine, I sat back to enjoy. First article  was a lecture by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the danger of mercury in fresh water domestic fish. Perfectly safe to fish we are informed (well duh). Just don't eat what you catch. Expectant mothers should be extra careful as babies with high level of mercury have lower IQs. The net is full of peer-reviewed studies from major universities on the subject of mercury poisoning. Why buy a food magazine to read what an activist lawyer has to say about the subject?Next article was in: ""Politics and the Plate"". The controversy  here concerns local and season foods. Gourmet asks: ""Are those who promote them sincere? Or is it just a come on for gullible diners?""  So who does Gourmet think is ""gullible""? The reader? Implication seems to be the reader is too stupid to figure out that yes, vendors might promote locally grown products that aren't all that terrific. Nothing of substance in this article at all. Going back to the front, an editor of Gourmet recalls how her late father didn't appreciate health food stores (Aren't fathers stupid?).Three downer articles in a row. I gave up. This isn't the magazine I remember from 20 years ago. Even the format is annoying. It is difficult to know where ads end and articles begin (recall the most junked up website you've seen, that is the Gourmet model) If you do enjoy the politics and  the environmental stuff (on either side)  you can do better on the net for free. If you want entertaining, informative articles on food, Gourmet is not the place to look.Subscribed to Saveur at the same time as Gourmet. It is a pleasure to read.  No annoying ads, no political screeds. Great photographs. Interesting and exotic recipes. As good or better than Gourmet was decades ago.",0
"I can't believe I never reviewed The Silence of the Lambs yet, simply because it is in my top 10 favorite movies ever made. Despite my father's best efforts to keep me from seeing it when it released, I still got my chance and I still love this movie like no other in my collection. I've always been fascinated with serial killers and this movie fueled my fascination even further. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I can only assume you've either been living in a cave this whole time, or you were too young to watch it when it came out. Either way, if you're one of the few people on this planet who has not yet watched it, go now. With so many reviews covering the plot, I won't go there, but if you like thrillers and serial killers and you've never seen this, you won't regret it. It's one you should own, not rent. It's timeless and amazing and it's worth it just for Hopkins' performance alone. Red Dragon and Hannibal were interesting and fun as well, but they have nothing on Silence of the Lambs. It will always stay in my top 10 favorites.",0
"Every toddler does odd things--insists on wearing the same outfit for days; drags a grimy, beat-up blanket everywhere; shouts ""NO!"" then grins as if expecting praise--and many adults are baffled. This book does an excellent job of explaining the ""why"" of what toddlers do. With each short chapter, the author deals with a specific question, such as ""Why do toddlers like to be naked?"" She spends a page or two talking about the developmental reasons that toddlers act the way they do, and then gives some concise advice about how you as a parent can choose to react and affect the behavior.This book is an easy read, but is backed by some serious research--it includes a ""Resources"" appendix with a whole heap of other books to look for. I read it in three or four evening/naptime reading sessions while my 2-year-old daughter slept, and I'm not one to read parenting advice books, really. The author's easy-going approach gave a positive you-can-do-this vibe that will validate almost every mother's (or father's, or grandparent's) choices. I feel like I know my daughter much better now that I can understand what she's learning when she wants to hear the same book forty-gazillion times or insists (loudly) on the red shirt, not the purple one. I'd recommend this for any first-time mom, and anyone else who has contact with a toddler.",1

"The third and final book in the trilogy is wonderful book. I don't think it's quite as good as the Elfstones of Shannara but it's a pretty exciting tale nonetheless. Allanon is back yet again to fight a new (sort of) evil that has showed itself with the intention of destroying the lands of Shannara. There are two main stores in this book, the journey of Jair Olmstead(?) and Brin Olmstead(?). Both are extremely interestesting and exciting. There is a ton of action but not so much that they don't have time to develop the main characters. It was awesome to see both Jair and Brin mature through the book along with Slanter, the gnome. If you are looking for an exciting trilogy that you will have a hard time putting down, if you are looking for great action, plot, great characters and a little romance then this is the series for you. All three books are exceptional!!!This series is great for younger readers as well, while there is a lot of action and battle scenes there is no swearing and no sex, implied or otherwise. It just goes to show that you can make a great action series without filling it with garbage.I can't wait to read more form Terry Brooks in the future!!",1

"I'm thankful that I found this wonderful series avail on DVD. Enough has been said in detail (frm other reviewers) about the characters, episodes, storylines et al.I'm only writing this to advise those who are considering to take the plunge and purchase ALL 4 seasons.The cheaper U.S. Release 'Platinum' DVDs' are just fine. All the quibbling over wether this is sub-par to the Canadian (import) DVDs' is down right silly. It reminds me of ""purists"" who use to argue that only through certain ""sophisticated"" sound systems could the music be correctly reproduced.Save yourself some significant cash; get the WHOLE show COMPLETE (4 seasons!) in 3 packages, sit back and ENJOY.Forget all this nonsense about this U.S. version being inferior.

"I've recently become a huge hitchhiker's fan and, after seeing the new movie, felt that I had to have the sound track.  I really bought it because I love the banjo laden ""Journey of the Sorcerer.""  Like most of the songs, though, I wish it were a longer version.  While all of the songs are really well done, most of them are 2 minutes or less.  This is not so bad when you listen to them straight through, since there is a detectable theme to the soundtrack.  Sometimes you can't even tell that the song switched.  Only if you want to listen to one particular track is the length a problem.  You get just a taste of the music and then the son switches before you can get really into it.  This is only a minor detail, however, when you consider how great the soundtrack is on whole.  I'm glad that they decided not to put a whole bunch of sound clips on the album.  Not that this is always bad, but isn't the dialogue what the movie is for?  In summation, this is a great album for anyone who enjoyed the music while watching the movie, and the extra songs that did not appear in the movie are also great",0

"One usually thinks of Milla Jovovich as that L'Oreal model with the crazy eyes or as a character from a video game. But an actress? Well, yes the French love her because she did Joan of Arc when she was nineteen or so, but then again the French think Jerry Lewis is a comic genius. Well, it looks like the French may be on to something. Milla rocks in this gritty feminist revenge parable. If you like down and dirty slice-of-life flicks, like Ken Loach's ""Ladybird, Ladybird,"" you'll love "".45."" This Hell's Kitchen sink drama gives Milla a role she can really sink her teeth in. There's one scene of a violent beating that is so real it's hard to watch. Plus Miss J. is fearless in the more provocative sequences. Her character gets to screw (or screw over) every other character. Check out the hot girl-on-girl shower scene.

I applied for a patent on my new and better method of doing something that was long overdue for improvement.	I read the book and made a list of questions to ask Don, or one of his staff.  Before approaching him, I visited his website, dondebelak.com  and viewed everything clickable.  At his site, I was glad to see that he offered three different methods through which he, or a staff member could assist me. I chose the most reasonable, by e-mail, as that way I have all the good info at my fingertips. The other options are by phone, where I'd have to remember everything they explained to me.  The third choice is having one of his staff members visit my place of business, which is my home. 	I phoned and asked for Don.  I explained what I was trying to do, and told him I had just finished his most recent book, and that I needed help, preferably by e-mail.  He said ""fine"", and asked a few questions.  Then he stepped me through what he saw as the best way to describe the invention, and we talked about the business plan, and what category of venture capitalists would be most interested in this type of invention.	The next day an e-mail laying out the next steps that needed to be taken and how to go about it was in my email box.

Not an easy task. It took me more than a year with persistence! But I did it.Socialism is not mentioned once the the actual work itself. (Of course it is mentioned in the 87 page Introduction which some of the ""reviewers"" might have bothered to skim through!)What is the name of the book? Capital! Not Communism or Socialism! One who has bothered to read this long book knows that the book has nothing to do with Communism. The book was supposed to form a scientific explanation of what the Capitalist mode of production was and how it formed and its' inner workings. Marx felt that after writing the pamphlet Manifesto of 1848, he owed it to the world tho explain what Capitalism was. It is a microscopic examination of the capitalist mode of production in mid-nineteenth century England. Granted that things have changed since 1850 England, the basic core of Capitalism hasn't changed. The man was brilliant, he obviously spent a lot of time formulating an understanding of what Capitalism is. It was an eye opener for me into what Capitalism really is. It was stimulating to see how Marx in the work slowly but surely synthesizes his successive points one by one thereby building a model of the Capitalist mode of production for one to examine. My only complaint was that it was too long. He could have said what he had to say in 200 pages rather than 800.",1

This is a very nice little camcorder works best in out door lighting or well lit indoor areas. I have gone thru many camcorders and it seems that the  analog ones worked better in low light than what the new DV camcorders do. So when looking for a truly great low light camcorder that is DV do not expect to get perfect picture quality it won't happen. Over all the PV-GS39 will give you good indoor quality and outstanding outside picture quality . For the money you will not find a nicer camera than this one. Watch for deals I picked my up at Amazon for only $[...] shipped best deal around. My old PV-GS36 cost me $[...] at costco and the are almost the same camera except the 39 has a larger screen and records in true widescreen format. Get this camera it will perform well in almost every aspect,0
"Because Hinton's is the first Joni Mitchell biography I've digested, I was hoping for something that didn't leave a cheap, plastic taste in my mouth.  The known parts of her life that are inspiring to me were reduced to banal fodder mentioned in passing, while darker aspects became reasons for the author to step up to her vehement defense--these outbursts were nauseating and usually at the expense of someone else, leaving many questions largely unresolved.  Hinton tends to shuffle back and forth between regurgitation of objective fact and jarring personal opinion.  Incidentally, I like what one reviewer said about this book reading ""like a last-minute book report"".  The fact that he completely destroys my favorite JM album in his woefully amaturish musical critiques doesn't help either.  This book does not do justice to an artist such as Mitchell",1
"I purchased the book for a teen-aged niece, who was, at first, very hesitant to read the book.  However, once she read through the first habit, she couldn't put the book down.

"Camilo Jose Vergara, a Chilean immigrant moved to New York City in 1970.  In order to better understand his newly adopted home, he used the city's subway system as a means to explore the city.  Trained as a sociologist, he took photos of what he saw.  ""Subway Memories"" is a collection of his best photos taken from 1970-2004.Individually, there is very little special about his photographs.  They look like snap shots of ordinary people and scenes.  What gives these photos value is that they are brought together as a collection.  Over the years, Vergara went back to the same spots and took photos from the same vantages.  Through this collection, the reader can see how sections of New York grew old, died, decayed and then were reborn.On a personal note, I can remember travelling New York's subways in the late 1970's and early 1980's.  These were the nadir years of New York's public transit system.  I loved seeing photos from that time period.  I still find it unbelievable to see how bad conditions were during these times.  Some of Vergara's photos are a blast from a nightmarish past. ",1

"I originally read about this movie in an issue of Fangoria magazine, which led me to believe that it was a horror film.  We picked it up and watched it and my first reaction was this is a crappy horror film, but man what an awesome action/drama!  After I saw the movie I reread the article in Fangoria and the author conceded that this movie was not a horror film (this totally slipped by me when I read it the first time), but was a film worthy of viewing by anyone who liked good films.  The author is right.  Dean Cain, usually associated with the Lois and Clark series, is better known to me through the horror films he's done like Boa and Dragon Fighter, and him hosting the Ripley's Believe It or Not series.  I'm not a big fan of his work, but always thought he was a descent enough actor.  He's excellent in this film.  There is not one point that I didn't believe him as this character.  He does an absolutely incredible job of making us believe him.  The supporting cast is brilliant with Danny Trejo as the menace on the road and Ashley Scott comes off as the perfect 'voice on the phone' that's easy to listen too and easy to believe.  The story is well thought out and it's an absolute blast to watch a bad situation goes from bad, to worse, and finally totally disintegrates right in front of him.  I'm not familiar with anything that Darren Lemke's done in the past, but if this is any indication of what is coming in the future, then I'm in for the ride of my life. ",0
"My sister gave me this book and I balked. Felt funny reading it. But Daylle makes sense. I felt like she was writing it to me. I knew a lot of what she writes about but it was the way she said it that made it click. I  recognized myself in many parts, especially the chapter on emotions. I  didn't like what I read but know it's true. Daylle's goal is to help men  understand why women need things from us that we hate giving. I've always  resented when a woman pushed for compliments or expressions of feelings.  First the first time I really understand how much upbringing is  responsible. She's right. Neither sex asked to be how they are. I've begun  to see my current woman differently and am slowly doing some of what I  learned. The emphasis on creating connections was a great lesson. I am  seeing that what Daylle calls &quot;the little things&quot; can go far.  They take little effort and make her happier and more agreeable. I've  already tried some of the suggestions for better sex and they work. I have  a much more responsive partner already, and she seems to be wanting it  more. Daylle doesn't emphasize crazy positions or anything unusual. She did  help me understand better how a woman's body operates and how much I can do  to make my partner want me more. This book is definitely worth the read!  Whatever tips you can use will make your life with women better",1

"The vocal version of &quot;Hidden Place&quot; is simply breathtaking; without the squishy noises of pudding through straws or card-shuffle beats provided by Matmos on the Edit version (which are by no means bad, either), the lyrics really come through. A real highlight is the whole verse in the middle of the song that was cut out completely from the Edit, in which Bjork sings my favorite lines: &quot;There lies my passion hidden/ there lies my love/ I'll hide it under a blanket/ lull it to sleep.&quot;  There are also two B-Sides. &quot;Mother Heroic&quot; features a celesta combined with resonant vocals. The final song, &quot;Foot Soldier&quot; is reminescent of two of Bjork's Homogenic-era songs, &quot;Hunter&quot; and &quot;My Snare,&quot; with a Vespertine flavor. The lyrics are like &quot;Hunter&quot;'s and the groovy, mellow beat is like &quot;My Snare&quot;'s. This song that starts out mellow , however, quickly crescendos into an all-out war cry: &quot;you go first/ conquer the darkness!&quot; An exellent companion to &quot;Hidden Place pt. One.&quot",0

"CAR TROUBLE is the title of Jeanne DuPrau's newest book.  Since she wrote CITY OF EMBER and SPARKS, I've been a huge fan. CAR TROUBLE is a totally different genre than DuPrau's fantasy realism books, more of a teen comedy with secrets, bad guys and a little romance.  I LOVED it!  CAR TROUBLE is a funny light YA about the misadventures of a 17 year old computer genius who is driving cross-country to start a fabulous job in CA.  Not only does he encounter ""car trouble"" and share the trip with two interesting friends, but he gains an awareness of alternate fuel types and a growing desire to change the world, which brings about positive changes in himself.This book offers a fun, surprising road adventure that will appeal to fans of Gordon Korman, Joan Bauer and David Lubar",1
"This is a FUN double-disc collection.  Power Ballads Gold has some awfully bad (in a good way) songs on it.  There were a few songs I had never heard before, but they definitely fit the hair-band mold.Definitely cheesey.  Definitely worth the money.  This is much better than buying all of the individual band's CDs, which probably only have one or a few good songs on them.  Rock out with your air guitar!  Good songs for singing extremely loudly on the way home from work",0

"Shore has taken the concept of community investment to the spires.  The analogy he draws between those who envision a community worthy of its members and those who over centuries built the grand Cathedrals of Europe  stirs the soul.  Cathedral Builders never work alone; they work in  communion across time and across the community.  And first they open the  cathedrals within their minds and hearts, and allow the people they aspire  to serve to build within. This book must be read by all who envisage  lasting change through non-profit or similar endeavors.  A true communion  of the Saints.  Shore takes us back to the basics with which we began  community.  He makes us dream together, stand on each other's shoulders,  and lift those who might otherwise be left behind to rise with us to the  heights.  You cannot come away from this book alone",1

This book is an excellent survey of the Old Testament.  Baylis traces each book of the Old Testament in its own theological development of how Jesus is to be the coming Messiah.        I highly recommend From The Cross To Creation for college students looking to understand the Old Testament because Baylis' writing style is smooth and easy to read.  I also recommend this book to seminary students as a scholarly work because Baylis' footnotes are extensive and provides for wide-ranging supplemental research.        As such this book makes a wonderful Bible study.  I have used Baylis' work in such a fashion with a college group and his insights were well received.  I believe this book is worthy of a five star rating,1
"I found this movie to be upbeat and also uplifting . It deals with Jessica Alba as a Hip Hop Dance Instuctor at a local Community Center and she is a Godsend to the inner city youth .

"Not every story in this volume is excellent, but they are all good at they very least, and several (I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon, Strange Memories of Death, and others) are among Dick's best.

The whole thing is worth owning, but that amazing story is unmissable",1
"Simple works. It's that simple. The authors of this newly published management guide don't do simple work. Schmitt is a senior executive in FedEx supplying solutions to complex logistical problems and Perl is an attorney who has practiced before the Supreme Court. Yet they've found that they can break down complex problems into simple components and solve them. Applying that principle of simplicity to business and government they demonstrate in this accessible guidebook how any manager can work more effectively and efficiently. They incorporate ""tools"" and ""passions"" that draw on both sides of the brain to not only analyze problems, but to find ceative solutions to them. You don't need an MBA to figure out that they're on to something.",1
"Having lived with two DMB fans, one of whom virtually worships the man and his band, I have been exposed to the vast majority of their tunes.  I think they're talented, but between Dave's somewhat indecipherable vocals and the sometimes over-the-top instrumentation, I find that whatever message they're trying to convey often gets buried.That being said, ""Live at Luther College"" is most definitely one (or two, if a two-disc set can't count as one) of the ten recordings I'd want with me if I were stranded on a desert island.I'd give all but maybe one or two songs a 5-star rating.  Even the ""Christmas Song,"" which, subject-wise, isn't exactly my cup of tea, is just too perfectly executed to deny.There are thousands of recordings that use electric guitar and of which I'm a huge fan, but if I had to choose, I prefer the purity of acoustic guitar.  The use of acoustic guitars alone gives this set a huge edge.  And Tim Reynolds is a virtuoso--probably as technically gifted as many respected classical guitarist, but with an equally impeccable ability to reinvent each of Dave's songs so that they have every bit as much groove, humor, emotion, and force (and often more) as they did with his full band backing him up.  Dave isn't half-bad either.And while they take their guitars to the very limits of unplugged rock, Dave's voice is still able to shine through clearly, and I can actually understand what he's saying more often than not (I've actually memorized most of the album, although there are some areas where I still mumble incoherent phrases in conjunction with what seems to be coming out of Dave's mouth).Virtually all of the power and emotion is generated by the musicians themselves, not by special effects or gadgets, and you can really feel what a memorable experience it must have been to attend that show",0

"This amazing collection of first-hand accounts of the survivors of the Bataan Death March is brutal but compelling reading.  Donald Knox has interviewed an extensive collection of survivors and persuaded them to tell the excruciating details of their capture, their time in the camps and on work details and their release.   Their stories are alternately shocking and inspiring.  The book is an invaluable historical resource, and any student of the war in the Pacific will find it fascinating reading.  Since it is presented as a collection of interviews from different sources, some familiarity with the story of Bataan and American POWs in Japan will help the reader place each story in the right context.  These testimonials can be gruesome, but it's important that the POWs' stories be told",1
This was probably one of the best programming books i've ever read. It is interesting all the way through but at the same time it teaches important programming concepts.

"The cover of the CD, which provided the inspiration for the album title and song according to the liner notes, shows an industrial wasteland created by communists in the former Soviet empire. The back cover shows a defaced billboard which mocks the United States of America and its position in the world.  The contradiction provided by the juxtaposition of these images is lost on Gilkyson and shows the level of sophistication one might expect from someone with only a high school education like her.  The opening song, ""Hiway 9,"" uses the melody and tempo of a children's song to support a frivolous political commentary.  This includes the racist attack that, Colin Powell, one of this country's greatest public servants, is ""a white man hidden in a black man's skin.""  Charming, especially considering that Gilkyson's family comes from the Philadelphia Social Register.  Things don't get much better from there with the usual puerile lyrics (Not Lonely, Wonderland, Separated) about longing for love and lust, which are getting a little odd coming from a 50 year old woman who has had more than her share of lovers.  The third cut, ""Dark Side of Town,"" is about one of her sister's innumerable boyfriends, a substance abuser who died recently of compications from Hep C.  The album is dedicated to him at end of the liner notes.  Great, that's inspiring to us all Eliza!  The song Tender Mercies starts off with words of sympathy for a suicide bomber who kills Jews at an Israeli shopping mall.  Once again, the deeper meaning of such an act is lost to Eliza.  Elsewhere, the ""Milk and Honey"" track manages to be pompous and trite at the same time while attempting profundity, and a children's song from her father is included.  The closing Woody Guthrie tune is far and away the best thing on the album.  It harks back to a time when those on the political left and right in this country could unite to fight Woody's favorite enemy: facists.  Too bad Gilkyson and her ilk don't even recognize the problem today, just like the isolationists in the 30s.  As she says in ""Milk and Honey"" - ""god's children....doomed to repeat history.",0
"I picked up this book hoping to be inspired by leaders who showed selfless sacrifice.  Instead, I found myself reading about people who lacked character and caved in to political pressure.  Like Carl Elliott, an Alabama legislator who signed a manifesto declaring that segregation was against the Southern way of life, joined the racist George Wallace on a campaign platform, and spent himself into poverty by buying TV ads with his Congressional pension while running for governor of Alabama.  This is a man of courage?  Then there's Judge Charles Price, whose crowing achievement seems to have been ruling that another judge could not display a plaque of the ten commandments in his courtroom.  Lowell Weicker was lauded for pushing a state income tax through after his election, though he had opposed such a tax as a candidate.  Oklahoma legislator Michael Synar, when faced with an audience of doctors questioning him about the Clinton health care plan, told them to go to hell and stormed out of the room.  When I got to the part about the ""courage"" of Ford pardoning Nixon for Watergate, I gave up reading in disgust.  Caroline Kennedy needs a new selection committee, one with a less liberal bias.  Here are a few candidates the committee might want to consider for the next awards:  Anwar Sadat, for tirelessly seeking Middle East peace and being martyred for it ... Bishop Desmond Tutu, a true moral leader who presided over South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission ... Winston Churchill, who sacrificed his political reputation to fight the policy of appeasement and to call for the shoring up of Britain's defenses against the Nazis' rising power ... and Dietrich Bonhoffer, the German theologian who was martyred for his resistance to  Hitler. If you want to read an incisive and well-researched book on character, I highly recommend Os Guinness's book, ""When No One Sees: The Important of Character in an Age of Image.",1

"This is a real glimpse of another era, but one not so intangible as we might think....we can definitely enjoy it, too.  Some of the sweetest things in life are the simplest pleasures, and a sniff of our bedsheets after drying in the sun, or drying off with a towel that did the same is a perfect example.  Since our olfactory sense is the one most tied to memories, this book would be a great one for those new to housekeeping or new mothers.  I can remember running through the sheets on my mother's clothesline, smelling my clean clothes as we brought them in and folded them.  I do the same for my family when I have the time, and my 78 year-old mother recently expressed a desire to start hanging out her wash again.  So since April 19th (yes, it's a Monday--traditional washday for years and years and years in our country) is National Hang Out Your Wash Day; I got the book for my mom and will pair it with a clothesline and clothespins.  It's a wonderful little book, and even has a recipe for lye soap that we used to make as kids.  It was pretty gross but those farm women were strong and even though I'll bet it took the skin right off their hands, they used it. We could learn a thing or two from them, I'm sure. ",1

"In studying Oppie I am reminded of the old saying about 'Gods too have feet of clay.' Oppie was a man of great talents, and some characteristics that I don't know if could be called great failures or not.  This book concentrates on the 1949 to 1955 period. These were the McCarthy years, when rumor, accusations, and the red scare. World War II was over, the Soviets, under Stalin had imposed the iron curtain. And it had become clear that communist spies in England and the United States had delivered the secrets of the atomic bomb to them.  As you might guess from the title, this book is very pro Oppenheimer. She blames Air Force officials, anti-Communist politicians, and competing scientists, particularily Edward Teller for seizing control of the U.S. nuclear policy and building ever more deadly weapons. Her telling of what happened is clear. Her philosophical tone is a bit more questionable.  She asks: Could development of the H-bomb have been averted? -- As a physicist I'll answer - No! It could be done (they thought at the time and were right), it would have been too intriguing a scientific question to let it pass. If not exactly at that time, then it would have been later. And considering the political situation at the time, no question that it would have been done.  She is very good about Oppie's weaknesses. After making an emotional appeal to Truman, Truman is rumored to have said, 'don't let that cry baby back into my office.'  There's a question I've always wondered, she doesn't answer it, I don't know that there is an answer. After the loss of his security clearance his influence on science policy was over. He became the director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton. He thought and wrote about the problems of intellectual ethics, morality, and the most advanced subjects in physics. Was he as happy doing this as he had been in the public eye?",1

The two hosts explained everything from getting into the position to tips on how to make each position better.  The video was elegantly done  and it gave us a lot of great ideas for having ""fun"" in the bedroom.  We tried all 27 positions and if I say it's a definite must buy for any couple.",0
Excellent quality and my Girl Friend loved them and wears them all the time,0
"I purchased the video because I saw Victoria on Animal Planet's ""Animal Precinct."" I liked the way the video used true rescue dogs, and shows that ANY dog can learn to behave.  The video uses a repetition/reward system and shows how all dogs can master the basics of canine manners.  Especially nice are the short interviews with the dog owners and how they found their dogs.  The music is great--some of it orginal tunes by the animal behaviorists!",0
"This &quot;easy read&quot; about a young man stuggling to change his behavior may offer other preadolescents/adolescents a character with whom they can identify. The story line is somewhat trite and not very exciting.  However, to a young person searching for some possible reasons for  &quot;why s/he does the things s/he does&quot; and coupled with the need  for a quick book report may be able to accomplish both with this &quot;one  night&quot; read",1
"Actually, I have just finished reading the follow-up to &quot;Dearest Dorothy, Are We There Yet?&quot; - which is &quot;Dearest Dorothy, Slow Down, Your're Wearing Us Out!&quot;  What delightful books these are.  They are &quot;Gentle Fiction&quot; like the Miss Julia Books, The Mitford Series and The Ladies of Covington.  How nice to be able to read books that have age-appropriate characters in them - especially when they have so much SPUNK! I believe the author has another book coming out at the end of August and am eagerly anticipating it already.  You will not be disappointed",1
Another fantastic compilation!  A musical emotional rollercoaster.  Beautiful and gritty all rolled into one. ,0
"George Roy Hill's film has its excitements and it claims the fashionable climactic bloodbath, but mostly it's played for fun... It's a highly individual Western; a triumph of style, in fact... The style is dominant, intelligent, flowing with charm; the playful teasing, and Newman supplied with a hat on a bike, and the contemporary lyrical Bacharach pop tune... It's a style that flowers in the Newman-Redford relationship, which is one of the most affecting in movies...All this gives it the feel and look of fanciful myth carried to a point unusually removed from reality... Backgrounds are sketched rather than etched... You are never really moving toward the west in time and place... With belief suspended, feelings are only light1y involved...But it's derring-do at its most flamboyant and given a tangy taste by its essentially modern sense of humor... When Butch and Sundance ride back from relaxation to their Hole-in-the-Wall lair and find they have a mutiny on their hands--Harvey Logan (Ted Cassidy) wants to take over--Butch doesn't quell it with bullets but with a boot up Logan's backside... It's that kind of picture...Similarly, when too much dynamite scatters the haul from a rail hold-up, this is a moment for wry, amusing comment... And when the posse pursues the pair this is one posse that 'heroes' can't easily shake off... It's always there, cleverly made more irksome by long-shot, so that finally only a 'death defying leap' as the circuses say, can separate hunted from hunters.... ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is undoubtedly a captivating tour de force... Its flavor is preserved from cloying by just the right edge of wistfulness provided by Katharine Ross as the schoolteacher girl-friend who goes along and who suggests the transience of it all...Newman and Redford good-natured fellowship is felt from the opening to the final scene... Sundance seems closer to the traditional Western character... He is strong, silent, willing to face confrontations and shoot it out... Butch is an atypical outlaw, enormously charming and courteous, has never killed anyone, and tries to avoid showdowns... Throughout the film, Newman is engagingly spontaneous in his expressions, gestures and timing of dialog...While Sundance is practical, Butch is a hopelessly ridiculous optimist and romantic dreamer... While they flee the posse, he continually expresses optimism, but beneath is a child-like need for reassurance... Small indications of his self-awareness emerge at other times, undercutting his casual exterior... For instance, despite the naturalness of the ménage-à-trois, Butch is really the outsider, and he knows it... In the lovely still-photo montage of their New York holiday, Butch watches with wistful longing as they dance, but then smiles--aware of his isolation but content in their happiness... ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" earned seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture... It won four (Cinematography, Score, Song, and Original Screenplay). ",0

"I bought this cookbook in November and use it 3-4 time a week.  Every recipe is easy and fast.  My boyfriend is somewhat of a picky eater and he likes just about everything I've made.  I bought copies for my empty nester parents and ""in-laws"" and would give it to every couple I know if I could.  I like the built in ""portion control"" since every recipe is for 2 which keeps us from over-eating.  The vegetarian recipes even satisfy carnivores.  Each recipe includes nutrient information, too, so when you need to up your calcium, fiber, etc. intake, you know what recipe to choose.  Even when you're too tired to cook, some recipes are so simple and tasty (chicken tarragon) it takes less energy to whip something up than look through the take-out menus.  I have dozens and dozens of cookbooks, but this is definitely the most-used.  Buy this book",1
"This DVD was expensive and disappointing.  I cannot recommend this for anyone who wants to use a DVD as a learning tool for makeup instruction.  It's not even good entertainment for those of us who consider the makeup-and/or-hair-styling-instructional-DVD genre as the epitome in chick flick decadence. The featured makeup artist, Ramy, may be talented - it's hard to tell based on this effort. The DVD comes across as nothing more than an extended infomercial promoting one artist, his New York salon, and his line of Beauty Therapy cosmetics.  And not a very tempting infomercial, either.There appear to be lots of products and colors visible behind Ramy's station as he works on the models.  However, he seems to use the same one or two products and colors on all of his subjects. That wouldn't be a problem if the featured colors were so neutral that they did the job for all the girls, but they don't.  Even though the majority of the models apparently fall into the warm-with-golden-undertones category, the two favored foundation colors (Porcelain Doll and Almond Princess) were obviously too yellow for most of them.  The fact that he used these colors almost exclusively leads one to conclude that the make up line is limited and leans toward warm tones, but not in a natural way.   The production values here weren't very good.  Although the DVD wasn't filmed in HD, it's simultaneously enlightening and ghastly to view this on an HDTV.  Not only is it disturbingly obvious that the products Ramy uses don't match the skin tones, they don't go on evenly.  Ramy continually stresses that his foundation is a liquipowder that goes on liquid but ""dries to a micronized powder"" - a very blotchy powder apparently.  The finished faces looked unnatural with patchy areas of uneven pigment around the mouth and  nose and obvious lines of demarcation.  Almost every one of the girls looked like a ""Glamour Don't"" after the make up was applied. Although his contouring work is pretty good, Ramy demonstrates by working on one side of the face and then turning the model's chair so we can see the difference between the two sides.  Unfortunately, while he's working, the camera is usually on the side of the model that isn't being worked on, so most of the time it's hard to tell what he actually did to get that effect.  If you're interested in picking up makeup tips and techniques, a much better choice would be the DVD, ""Your MakeUp - Simple Steps to Amazing Looks"".  That DVD, also available on Amazon, has higher quality video, more practical instruction, and greater diversity among the subjects.  It features a variety of male and female make up artists using generic make up and describing in detail everything they're doing and why. It is far more interesting and instructional than Ramy's extended sales pitch for his cosmetic line.",0
"Timeless. The story's still powerful, the performances still splendid in spite of the passage of time since the film's first release. That's quite a treat. This is an historic drama with wit, intelligence and a refreshing lack of heavy handedness. On another note it's great fun to see ""early editions"" of some of the cast. Leo McKern (Cromwell) was Rumpole even then and who could have imagined Robert Shaw (Henry) as the shark hunter in ""Jaws""? Come to think of it, fortry years ago who could have imagines ""Jaws""? Too often seeing the re-release of an old favorite has left me wondering what I liked about it in the first place. Not so A Man for All Seasons. Great flick then, great flick now! ",0
"Having read the works of Georg Feuerstein and Swami Satchidananda, this is my third foray into the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, and I would have to rate this as the best of the lot.

For someone new to the subject, Hariharananda is quite informative, with lots of background information",1
This movie was made back in 1975 where it seems EVERYBODY was jumping from one person's bed to another. The plot is pretty thin. This guy entrusts Warren (without the soft focus lens in Dick Tracey) to look after his girfriend. Warren plays a hairdresser so this guy makes incorrect assumptions about Warren's Sexual Orientation. I think this movie would have made a better Documentary about Warren's sex life however I do give it 5 stars for some reason which I can't quite think of right now because it is 110 degrees outside here in the HOT Australian Summer which kind of fries my fragile little brain,0
"This is one of those vacation-like books that I hoped wouldn't end. From the peaceful beginnings of the St. Johns to its rollicking arrival at the Atlantic Ocean, each page delivered a new marvel. Belleville followed his nose deep into the river-weeds, down into underwater caves, and out to the center of beautiful, bird-ful lakes. And he didn't shy away from observing that damnable human yearning to live as close as possible to the water's edge. All the world is wrapped up in this river: I found reason to marvel, reason to rail, and reason to hope for the future",1

If you're looking for insights and the scoop on the great Walter Jacobs, look no further.  Buy this book now, blues people",1
"Here,John Milius has put together a truly enjoyable film! For the serious fan of historically-based movies, this one may be a bit overly-idealized, in the blatant patriotism...and that is why I loved it! This movie is a refreshing bit of optimism and national pride, in a time when it is ""fashionable"" by self-proclaimed ""enlightened"" critics to disparage America's national heritage. This negative and dysfunctional trend has gotten quite tiresome, and its about time someone made a purely patriotic film such as this!There will probably never be another statesman like Theodore Roosevelt, truly the greatest American president ever. Being a man of action, Roosevelt resigned his position as Assistant Secretary of the Navy to form his own Army unit when America went to war with Spain. Having lived out West for several years as a rancher in North Dakota, Roosevelt realized that cowboys would make an outstanding volunteer cavalry unit. The average cowboy was skilled at riding, marksmanship, and survival, making them ideal ready-made soldiers. Adventurous men from all corners of the United States joined Roosevelt's cavalry: not only cowboys, but college students, Native-Americans, professional athletes, and veterans of previous military service. Regardless of their status as a cavalry unit, they actually fought as infantry in most of their battles in Cuba.  The brotherhood and cameraderie of this unit of ""Rough-riders"" was real and legendary, and they fought quite well as foot-soldiers, especially in the capture of heavily fortified Kettle Hill and San Juan Hill. The war with Spain was the beginning of America's rise as a world power, and Roosevelt was there from the start! His part in that was originally small, but history would eventually witness him playing the greatest role in America's rise to prominence",0

"Child molestation is an uncomfortable topic. But far worse, it is a very real danger. A large percentage of childhood molestation goes unreported, silently scarring a child for life. This book strikes the right balance: it is not too technical, not awkward, and most importantly not frightening. The message is conveyed through a mom telling a story to her child and through repetition. The content and wording is geared toward a child as young as 3 although concepts such as trickery and secrecy are a little difficult to teach at this age. The book gives context and viable solutions that a child can handle. My child is now very good at screaming ""Get away from me; I'll tell my mom and dad!"" Don't take the risk; read this book",1
"Thompson's commentary is a beautiful combination of scholarship and devotion.  Of the commentaries and study guides I have used in preparing sermons on Jeremiah, this has been the richest source of help.  I appreciate this series of commentaries for its evangelical commitments as well as its willingness to deal with most of the critical issues surrounding each book, and Thompson handles those issues deftly while keeping an eye on the pastoral angle of Jeremiah.  In my opinion, this is a ""must have"" for the serious pastor or student working their way through Jeremiah",1
"Judy Rabinor has the rare gift of educating through beautifully crafted stories. Each chapter could stand alone as a beautifully written short story, and the cumulative effect grows, so that by the book's conclusion, the reader has an ever-deepening understanding of this most difficult issue. I have recomended this book to patients who suffer from eating disorders, their parents, mates and friends. They thank me for the recommendation, and tell me that not only is each chapter filled with the realities that they have faced, but also that their understanding of this profound problem is further deepened. Dr. Rabinor's honesty about not only her patients, but also her own experience of the therapeutic process, including the pain some of the cases have induced in her, was especialy welcome. This is a book that belongs on the shelf of anyone who has been touched by this problem, and any therapist who treats it",1

"Here we have a perfect combination of one of the most beloved and moving operas ever composed and the most naturalally intense singer actresses of the last century. Although Verdi's La Traviata is filled with difficult and fascinating music, the whole result is a perfect drama, in which the beauty of the music sounds exactly like the expression of the inner drama of its characters. You'll hear Violetta singing ""Sempre libera"" and will sense that those coloraturas are really an expression of both confusion and joy, as the long breathed phrases of ""Amami, Alfredo"" will make your heart beat faster. However, it's necessary to have a great singer to convey this sense of vocal spontaneity and dramatic naturalness. During the recorded history of Opera, we've had wonderful Violettas who reached a fantastic level of greatness, like Sutherland, Gheorghiu, Zeani, Cotrubas and many others. However, one can't deny that Maria Callas was not only a very dramatic Violetta. She's definitely the one who most understood that character. Hers is certainly the deepest sense of dramaticism we've ever seen on the Opera stages. Her Violetta, as her Lucia, is always imbued with a kind of frailty and vulnerability that only someone who understands the human soul deeply can deliver. The way Callas colours the phrases, with endless levels of shades and tones, reveals all the beauty and pathos of Violetta's music. In this performance sung in Lisbon in 1958, dramatically, Callas reached her best interpretation of Violetta, even surpassing herself at La Scala in 1955. Her voice may not be the gleaming walll of rich sound anymore, but she still retains most of her vocal qualities. Her somewhat widened vibrato is controlled masterfully, and she even uses it for dramatic purpose, what is always exciting! Her exquisite mixture of metallic tones with more delicate and lyrical ones is highly effective in her ""Ah, fors'è lui"" and in her duets with Alfredo and with Germont. Her tearful pianissimi in ""Addio del passato"" are maybe the most moving sounds I've ever heard.Alfredo Kraus is, as always, a most refined interpreter as Alfredo. His is one of the most beautiful tenor voices of the last decades. Besides, unlike some of his rivals in this role, he really sounds youthful and passionate. Mario Sereni is an excellent Giorgio Germont as well.However, the greatest reason, at least for me, for buying this legendary recording is listening to Callas' intense and moving portrayal of Violetta. Here Callas shows what an intelligent and deep artis she was and, besides, she's joined by a remarkable cast. Don't lose the chancge of listening to the most moving combination of voice and drama ever",0

The selections in the book are smart and entertaining and Tonelli's perspective on Italians and Italians writing is especially insightful.

"In order to understand Jim Sheridan's fine film, The Field, based on the play by the same name by J.B. Keane, it is useful to know some of the Irish history that relates directly to this tragic story.A little less than 800 years ago the English first came to Ireland and initiated a slow but steady conquest of the island and people. By the 19th century the catholic Irish had lost most of their land and their freedom to the protestant English. The great Irish statesman Daniel O'Connell made modest progress in winning some liberty for the Irish catholics in the early part of the 19th century. Unfortunately, the Great Famine, which began in 1845 and lasted until 1848, killed a million or more Irish people who were dependent on the potato, which suffered from a disastrous blight.  Two million more people fled the island to foreign shores, America being one preferred destination.  A population of approximately eight million people was reduced by about 36%.  The Irish never forgave the English for allowing this great tragedy to occur.  The ill effects of this disaster lasted well into the 20th century.In the film The Field, ""The Bull"" McCabe (Richard Harris), a tenant farmer in a small town in southwestern Ireland, mentions the famine and its after effects several times to justify his right to buy the field that he and his family have given their love and labor for generations.  The English woman who owns the field has put her property up for auction and an American, Tom Berrenger, appears ready to outbid McCabe for the field.  McCabe will not permit what he perceives to be a miscarriage of justice.  Against him are the American and his ally, the local parish priest.  McCabe does his best to reason with these men and explain why he feels he has a right to the field.  McCabe mentions the Great Famine and the sacrifice his family made to remain in Ireland to rebuild a devastated society.  This field represented not only McCabe's life, but life for his posterity.  The priest and the ""Yank"" are unmoved by his arguments so McCabe takes the law into his own hands with disastrous consequences for him, his wife, and his son.This fine film gives us a chance to learn much about the Irish people and their culture.  The importance of the land, the power of religion, the hatred of the English, the poverty of the people, and the loss of Irish youth to emigration are just of few of the themes touched on as the story develops. The Field was made in Ireland and the beauty of the land is everywhere evident, in stark contrast to the meanness of the lives of the people who live there.  We don't need to be Irish to be moved by the desperation of McCabe and people like him trying to eke out a living by their unremmiting labor.The Field is less an entertainment and more an education for those people wanting to gain some insight into the lives of the Irish farmers living in the first half of the 20th Century.  I have watched this film several times with great interest as well as appreciation for Jim Sheridan's fine work.  Highly recommended",0
"J.R. Graham has written an excellent book giving history and legal perspectives. Other reviews have made excellent observations of the content.One reviewer erroneously commented that the book was factually flawed in that the Constitution prohibits secession. That is, of course, untrue. The section he refers to has to do with the admission of new states and a new state cannot be formed of other states without the consent of Congress. It doesn't take a book to understand the legitimacy of secession. After all, that's what the Declaration of Independence was about. If one rejects secession, one must also reject the Declaration of Independence.The most serious flaw in the book regarded race and citizenship - a topic not really the focus of the book anyway. The author cites a judges opinion that non-whites that were free were citizens and the author generalizes this to all states. In fact, only a few states recognized non-whites as citizens. And because all privileges of citizenship had to be recognized throughout the United States, these non-white citizens could not properly be called US citizens until a new class of citizenship was created by the 14th Amendment. The author imagines that citizenship existed without voting rights (after all, white women could not vote either.) However, voting was always something required to indicate membership in the ""sovereignty"" and it could be established with certain qualifications - age, sex, etc. But could you imagine the possibility of prohibiting all whites from participating in government? It is clear that voting has a great bearing on the concept of citizenship.It is abundantly clear from most state constitutions, numerous naturalization acts and court rulings that race formed an essential element of who ""the people"" were that formed the United States. The point is not ""racism"" but simply what historically a ""nation"" was thought to be. Even Webster's 1828 dictionary pointed out that ""posterity"" had to do with a ""race"" of decendents. My point here is to just be clear that Dred Scott was not some exceptionally bad ruling but was actually indicitive of the overwhelming majority of thought. That to create a pluralistic, multi-nationalistic, global community of the former United States requires dealing with the past Christian history that considered race important. One way to do that is to sweep it under the rug as this author has done. But I am of the old school of dealing truthfully with the past.The other flaw was the author's failure to recognize the full scope of the 14th Amendment's harm to America. By creating a new subject-class citizenship called a US citizen which allows even corporations to now be called US citizens, it has forever confused the original nature of state citizenship. This is well documented in court cases and even declared to be ""well settled"" in many others. The Utah Supreme Court wrote an excellent treatise on the 14th Amendment, exposing it's flaws in text and how it was illegally ratified.In spite of the flaws on these off-point topics, I highly recommend this book. Unfortunately his commentary on the 14th Amendment and on citizenship does undermine his scholarship a bit",1

"Couple of ADD doctors have written this book.  If YOU have ADD/ADHD, you will love reading this book.Writing style: Easy (4 out of 5), important for an ADD readerStructure: Well structured (5 out of 5), important for an ADD readerWhat's good 1: The authors have gone about on a random walk, and thrown in lots of related bits and pieces.

I'd give a 4 out of 5 for gathering together information that may not be available easily elsewhere.What's good 2: The resilience the authors have demonstrated and their gung ho attitude, you'd come off thinking that ADD is a God given gift or something!

Yes, EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE.  You can't escae thinking how much stress you had gone through and how much you've lost out because of ADD.  It makes it so much worse (or better?) to know that ADD is so easily managed/treated!  If you are not an insider you can't know what I am talking about.By the way, if your ADD is not severe or does not come with other coexisting nasty issues, the biggest damage ADD can do for you is by confusing your base line.

"I believe the earlier prints of this book were called &quot;Storytelling and the Art of Imagination&quot;.  This book outlines various essential parts of a story, characters and how they have been traditionally used, symbolism associated with characters and settings, and examples from folktales.  After reading this you may never look at fairytales in the same way again.  It encourages you to write for yourself, and those you love, and gives examples of how people who have attended her classes have achieved personal healing by putting their own difficulties in a written (or verbal) fantasy form.

"A Sense Of Wonder: Samuel R. Delany, Race, Identity And Difference is an in-depth study and criticism of the works of Samuel R. Delany, one of the the modern era's most amazing cross-genre writers.

"I own too many Italian cookbooks, so I wasn't looking for another one, but my my sister gave me Joyce Goldstein's Italian Slow and Savory and I love it.  In fact, it's now my favorite.  Given my aforementioned Italian cookbook habit, that is saying a lot.The author has traveled extensively through Italy and the recipes reflect an excellent palate and impressive knowledge of Italy's culinary history.  Yet these aren't the same recipes that you see in other cookbooks over and over again. I'm a fairly experienced home cook, but I have little patience for over-produced dishes. Slow and Savory translates to easy and delicious. Also this is a beautiful book. The photographs are stunning and I love the way the recipes are laid out on the page. This is a cookbook I will use over and over again and will give as gifts-even to my friends who have too many cookbooks.",1

"A really fun read - this book is part social criticism, part pop culture memoir.  The author writes about what's wrong with some of the media effects research in a way that is actually entertaining.  I wish I could have read a book like this when I was in college.  It really gets you thinking",1
"My son absolutely loved this book!  He first saw it in a book store in the mall.  His eyes grew wide, his face beamed and he jumped up and down pleading with me to buy it for him.  I ordered it from Amazon and surprised him with it a few weeks later and I don't think he has put it down since.  This book, like the other ""ologies,"" is very SPECIAL!  Every inch of it from the compass on the front to the faux ruby on the back is unique and beautiful.  My son even brought it to school for show and tell.  There is no better book for the little pirate in your life!",1
"An absolute wonder, a perfect selection of Beat writings: Poems, fragments of novels, essays, history, mythology, philosophy...  The Portable Beat Reader is one of the most essential books in my collection and rarely leaves my side.  And it is, thankfully, portable, and much easier than bringing everything with you all the time.  Aquire it, open it, and just start reading",1
This book is an excellent read. I originally checked it out at the local library on a fling and now i am going to buy it. If you want to know what modern day heros are like- this book will keep you engaged,1
"I thought maybe it was just old age creeping up on me. The Jimi Hendrix that I remember from my youth sounded a whole lot better than what I saw on this DVD. I thought I had just changed my tastes and wasn't into his songs anymore. Then I read some reviews here....and I feel better. It wasn't me: it was this concert - it sucked!I just wanted to have something on film of one of the most famous guitar players of all time, so I thought this long concert would do it.  All it turned out to be was noise, which was really disappointing considering the songs I liked best from him were all included in this concert. Unfortunately, they were hardly recognizable.  Save your money on this one",0

"I have purchased nearly all the books from the Junie B. Jones collection.  My daughter enjoys listening to me read them to her.  We originally got one book through scholastic book club through the school and I literally read that book to her over and over again.  Having a good amount of the collection just makes it more diversified for me ~ and keeps me interested too.The books are well written.  A girl can identify with the subjects of the book and even though the books are long, they are not so long that 2 or 3 chapters a night doesn't complete the story in 3 nights.  I highly recommend the collection to anyone with a girl in the lower grades at school. ",1
"For the price this is the greatest, it is comfortable and the massage feature is very tingly. The only problems I see with this chair is the width of the seat, if you have wide hips this might not be the chair for you. The other thing is the controls for the massage are bolted to the seat on the side so it's very awkward to ajust them with out bending clear over or having a tiny hiny. We really love our chair though",0

"Though this book is packed with information it is not only interesting but fun to read.

"This is a extraordinary book crafted in the highest quality. You will receive a beautiful embossed slipcase and inside is the hardcover book. The slipcase is a art all its own with vibrant color, embossing, and cutouts of the 2 main characters. The cutouts show the hardcover underneath. Once you slide the book out you will be amazed at the paper engineering and whole design of the book. The publisher went to great lengths to make one of the best ""Art of"" books I have EVER seen as of today (and I have seen many). Every attention to detail is provided; sketches, paintings, and detail concept art. On every other page there are tons of inserts that are separate from the books content, like postcards, greeting cards, fold-outs etc. with even more art (I don't want to spoil the surprises of what is in the inserts). The book is made up to look like a Park Guide. I am very surprised by the thought and look that went into the book. Even though its paper it still has a interactive quality that seems to make you part of the book, by folding back each insert etc. it's like you are unwrapping a secret.   Even if you liked or didn't like the movie, everyone can enjoy the book's art/design and content. One of the best ""Art of"" books I have seen yet!",1

"Jamie Foxx might be best known as a mediocre actor (with one good performance as ""Ray."").  But now he can best known now as a mediocre singer/writer.  While he has a good voice, he's either corny or has no hooks.  Basically, there is no substance but he figures he can capitalize after the movie ""Ray.""

"This wonderful film immerses the viewer in the experience of Kumbh Mela.  There is no unnecessary narrative telling you what you are seeing or what you are supposed to think about the incredible events occurring here.  I appreciated that the viewer is allowed to form their own thoughts and ideas as the documentary unfolds.  I am also delighted that this film will bring this ancient festival into the homes and hearts of people around the world who can now share in the wonder of this tradition.  It is especially encouraging to know that the largest gathering of people in recorded history, visible from space, was inspired by a deep and abiding love and spiritual belief",0
"Learn to think; stop regurgitating.I am quite fond of this book, although Buckley has written and continues to write words of great elucidation. This one has been most formative for me. It is dated in its references, but the thought process and basis for reasoning is tried and true. Highly recommended for young people; especially those who consider themselves to be in one place or another politically, but are not entirely sure of the logic behind their beliefs, and would like to begin the journey of becoming a homo sapien",1
"Phil Bolger is the only boat architect I know who readily admits mistakes. This makes this book the best book about boats one can read. Only mistakes lead to experience. It is incredible how much you learn and how it changes  ones opinion about how a boat should look.

This is one of the few books on boat-design which I have actually  read from start till end",1
"Tourangeau, Rips and Rasinki collaborated over four years to put this terrific volume together - and the hard work shows in its 342 pages of clearly written text and and close to 40 pages of references. Full marks all round! The book covers psychological topics (such as how respondents recall facts - or don't, and how people make estimates,) as well as such technical topics that guide us in questionnaire design. The three authors cover a huge range of human biases in the way respondents perceive and contextualise the questions we endeavour to write. At every step they provide us with clear and sometimes dramatic examples, for example where responses shift by more than 30 per cent simply through question order.   This is one of the few market research/survey design texts where the writing is cogent and clear: written in a style that I'd describe as colleague to colleague. Bravo! What a difference this makes.I consequently rate this book right up there with the excellent Scott Plous book, Psychology of Judgment & Decision Making as one of the two most essential backgrounders for survey designers and questionnaire writers. We ignore respondent biases at our peril: this volume specifically shows us how to write more reliable, less ambiguous questions - and how to interpret the sometimes unexpected results we receive for our efforts",1

"In my opinion this book is mostly circular advice. It's like coaching a basketball player on foul shooting and telling him little more than ""make the shot.""There is a useful checklist on page 52.I think the Falk and Fajans book is a better purchase.

"I came across this book when advising a friend's college-age child who was researching careers and was using this book.On the plus side, the book does contain info on basic job search skills.  I would say that most (if not all of it) is now widely available via the internet.Very troubling was the inaccurate guidance regarding specific careers - some of it was just outdated, but some of it was inaccurate to the point of being ""dangerous"" for a reader with little knowledge or experience, and who would choose to spend time/effort pursuing a career based on the info in this book.  I would have to recommend against using this book as a key source for making a career choice",1

"This book uses many of the retail stores' and catalog's current and (unfortunately) discontinued products.  If you have often looked through the catalog or the store and thought you wanted your office to look like it does in the book, there are inspiring ideas here.  For example, the designers show us new uses for old items (candy jars used to store binder clips, for example).  The downside of the book(s) is(are) that some of the items featured are older Pottery Barn items that are now discontinued.  Perhaps you can find some on eBay, but some are several years old and probably can't be found.  However, it still gives the reader new ideas.  The reviewer who said that it is all ""junky looking old things"" may not appreciate Pottery Barn's sense of whimsy and incorporating new with old.  This book does plenty of that.  The one gripe I have with the book (any decorating book) is that it appears that computers, monitors, and phones do not have wires.  It's very easy to arrange these staged offices and never have to plug in the cables and power cords.  This book therefore makes it look a little easier than it really is.",1

If  you're looking for a book that will inspire you or a group to grow in love  with God with your heart, soul and mind, choose &quot;And I Will Praise  Him.&quot; Interactive questions makes for easy discussion.   Hebrew-made-simple explains the greater depth.  Ask any of Dr. Allen's  decades of seminary students if his life matches his message and you'll  know why his classes and books take an honored place in their understanding  of God's Word",1
"Ann Lindsay's holistic approach to water color has givien me a  fresh chance to learn intuitively...and with delight...to adventure into unmapped terrain as a child does...to bypass those voices of fear and doubt...to  nurture, to validate, and even to liberate creative impulses never before  encountered... Ann Lindsay is a gifted guide and teacher, whose approach  has been quite literally life-changing.    Her book takes you by the hand  and lays out the basic steps with simplicity and ease...no rights or  wrongs...just experiments and explorations...followed with gentle,  attentive questions about the experience.  How did it go?  What was fun?  What happened that you liked?  Or didn't? How did it feel? What did you  see?   The lessons follow upon one another beautifully, providing just  enough structure to get going comfortably...with plenty of room to find  one's way...to make wonderful discoveries about the process. This is a  guidebook, and its value shines in the doing and in the trying out.  Only  after the journey had started did I realize how skillfully and sensitively  I was being led.   As a psychologist, I recognize that her integration of  left and right brain processes makes absolute sense...as a spiritual seeker  I believe the deep importance of her emphasis on connecting with the inner  resource and listening to the voice of the heart...and as a beginning  student of watercolor I know that her encouragement and her accompaniment  have been just what I needed to break through those mighty barriers of  inadequacy and impossibility. Entrusting myself to the processes in which   Ann Lindsay invites us to participate continues to be an experience of  discovery and joy",1

"In this sprawling, captivating, most readable biography, Walter Isaacson has drawn a well-balanced, multi-layered portrait of Einstein. It is quite possible that growing up slowly has its advantages. In his early childhood Einstein was a slow learner. He learned to speak only after the age of two. And because of his slow verbal development, ""he thought that it allowed him to observe with wonder the everyday phenomena that others took for granted. Instead of puzzling over mysterious things, he puzzled over the commonplace,"" the author has written.Walter Isaacson states that Einstein once explained how he happened to discover the theory of relativity: ""The ordinary adult never bothers his head about the problems of space and time. These are things he has thought of as a child. But I developed so slowly that I began to wonder about space and time only when I was already grown up. Consequently, I probed more deeply into the problem than an ordinary child would have.""I was not surprised to read that even though his parents were irreligious, Einstein himself believed in God, a ""God who reveals Himself in the harmony of all that exists"".  Not all scientists are atheists, of course. He saw no contradiction between science and religion. ""The religious inclination lies in the dim consciousness that dwells in humans that all nature, including the humans in it, is in no way an accidental game, but a work of lawfulness that there is a fundamental cause of all existence,"" he has said.When I hear the name Einstein, I think of the bust of Einstein I saw in a museum when I was six years old. The bust, sculpted of fine white marble and placed on a black marble pedestal, was given a prominent place in the museum hall. After reading Walter Isaacson's biography of Einstein, I felt as if the author had transformed the cold marble sculpture into a warm and beautiful statue of clay, and relocated it from its glistening pedestal to a pedestal of molded clay, fired to brick-red in a kiln. Now grainy and highly textured and stripped of its halo and made to look earthy and human, the formidable bust suddenly looks more inviting, approachable, and even likable.  With the aid of newly released personal letters and archival documents that were unavailable to biographers before, Isaacson has written a charming and impressive biography, as unexpected and startling as a previously unknown type of delicious and succulent fruit, almost like a pineapple that grows on a slightly prickly plant.  What better way to conclude this brief review than with the words of Einstein himself: ""Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind."" I must say that this book has won me over.  ",1
"I usually don't start reading mystery series until several books have been published,  but because I am such a fan of Emilie Richards's other book, I picked up this one . . . and almost regret it because I want to read the next few books in the series this afternoon and they haven't been published yet.  The characters are ideal for a series because there is so much to explore about each. Aggie's parents (whom we didn't meet this time)are going to be interesting and funny.  Ed (the minister-husband) is presented through nuanced details, and I am eager to spend more time with him.  Although he is admirable,  he is not a cardboard saint.  He is an interesting man, and his profession is only one part of that.  The heroine has a wonderfully funny, occasionally ironic voice. You want to be her friend.This author has an expansive imagination, and her other books are therefore long (but never boring).  So a series seems a perfect canvas for her",1
"I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': ""You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!"" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up......",1

I love this Book. As a student of architecture now in my final year I must say that this book has helped me immensly over the past 1.5 yrs. When we are given a new project I go staight to my atlas and the building types index to find numerous buildings I can research as case studies. Even though there is only a half page on most buildings it gives you enough of an idea of whether a project is worth researching in more detail.An excellent reference which has made me aware of many lesser known architects wonderful works. I recommend this book to any architect or student of architecture. It is like someone else has said before; recieving 5 years worth of journals in one hit! Only problem is finding a table big enough to read it on,1
"This is a good critique of the assumptions made by Eurocentric historians over the years about the superiority of Europe as compared to the inferiority of the rest of the world.  Blaut effectively examines and explodes each theory dispassionately but thoroughly.  Finally he comes up with his own explanation for European success since 1492:  America.  Europe's &quot;discovery&quot; of and exploitation of North and South America gave it the wherewithall it needed to overtake and surpass the rest of the world.  A well written, well documented assessment which deserves a place beside The Great Divergence and ReOrient, among others",1

"Heard the cassette version of JACKIE, ETHEL, JOAN: WOMEN OFCAMELOT by. J.

"First of all, I'm a big Smashing Pumpkins fan and always wondered where the inspiration for the song ""Tristessa"" came from. Then, I'd read that it was a Kerouac novel, but didn't actually read this until after I'd read ON THE ROAD.. While ON THE ROAD really got me into liking Kerouac, i think it was this one (and THE ART OF HAPPINESS by the Dalai Lama) that got me into spirituality and Buddhism more specifically. It's really his observations that stand out in this novel, and I have to say that this novel is sweet in its briefness, and also somewhat more emotionally involved than some of his other books, since it's a love story of sorts.Definitely pick up this book.",1
"I like this book! ""The Power of the American Presidency"" is an informative and enjoyable book to read. Genovese gives the reader a broad view of the roots of the American presidency and its powers.  Readers will see how some presidents excelled while others lagged behind, how some presidents developed and strengthened presidential powers to lead the country forward while others weakened them and failed to lead....Genovese describes how a president was accused of breaking the law, or at least? steered around the US Constitution? in order to save a nation, how some loved the position of president while others couldn't wait for their term to end. Genovese shows us the presidents that made the top of the list of great presidents, those who landed on the bottom, and how others took the deep plunge into presidential obscurity. The reader will also discover which president served the longest term, which served the shortest, which president disliked politics.... But most importantly, Genovese explains the development of the American presidency and the expansion of its power. ""The Power of the American Presidency"" entices the reader's thirst for knowledge and serves as a good jumping point for further study on the American presidency and presidential powers. Genovese's writing is smart, crisp, and at times witty but always clear. I like that this book can be read from beginning to end, as I did, or it can be used as a reference tool, as I frequently do. I wholeheartedly recommend this book",1

"Like Hein's first book, I found myself compelled to read this one twice in short succession.Why? In Planetary Intelligence, Hein reveals certain obvious truths about our relationship to reality that are so clear, yet so simple that I might never have noticed.  A friend calls these kinds of understandings the ""elusive obvious"" in that once you see them, you wonder how society could miss them for so long.  Discovery of Hein's new simple paradigms of wisdom has been both fun and immediately useful in my life.For example, many people believe that prayer is effective, and I have gradually come around to this point of view on my own.  Hein, doesn't discuss prayer at all, yet what he teaches in Planetary Intelligence has given me a pragmatic confidence to use prayer more often.  Doing that, emboldened by the notions in his book, has made a prompt and profound difference in my life. I will always be grateful to him for sharing his discoveries with me via this book",1

It was done when the government REQUIRED it.They didn't lose money. The demand was so great that there was a huge waiting list! Even though people were only ALLOWED to lease them, the BEGGED to buy the electric cars! I'd buy one and so would a lot of people.

"There are a lot of books out there that purport to help you look good from head to foot, but of all the ones I've looked through, ""Getting Gorgeous"" is by far the best.  Lavishly illustrated and photographed, ""Getting Gorgeous"", unlike most other books on the subject, is as long on substance as it is on style.  There are chapters covering every beauty topic usually discussed, plus a couple the other books overlook, such as teeth and fragrance.  Each topic goes into depth, with a lot of ""How-to"" illustrations, a Q&A section, and recommendation of products that really work.  This last can be especially helpful to those who are confused by the sheer volume of beauty products out there and can't decide which to purchase.""Getting Gorgeous"" uses photographs of some gorgeous people to make its statement; the subjects are all celebrities or professional models, but the book is all-inclusive in its focus on different ages and ethnic backgrounds.  Here, besides the usual 20-somethings, are Thandie Newton, radiant in her 30's, Candice Bergen, still drop-dead beautiful in her late 50's, and many other faces of varying ages and colors.  ""Getting Gorgeous"" doesn't promise the reader that she will look anything like them, but the reader is encouraged, after reading this book, to try new and different procedures that will help to make the most of what she has.  In terms of what you'll spend on beauty products, consider this book one of the best investments you'll ever make",1

"I've read Help! I'm Married to a Homeschooling Mom and it is a great book for men who naturally don't think of the obvious.  It has made me more aware of help that my wife needs both physically and emotionally as she is buried in homeschooling day in and day out.  It has also helped me with some practical things I can do to assist in the homeschooling effort that I hadn't even considered.   It's an easy read (for those of us that hate to read) and will be a huge blessing to your family, particularly your wife.  I'd recommend the book to anyone.  It's definitely worth it",1

"I'm dumbfounded by all of the credit given this book, especially by former author's who have written about the Agency and the subject of intelligence.  Shame!There's an old saying in CIA that says, ""There's nothing more useless than a well known secret,"" which leaves me to wonder of the purpose of this book, other than to make a fast buck.  I get the feeling that what we have here is ""payback"" from a trainee that has been found ""wanting"" in a program that challenged him beyond his talents.As a former intelligence officer with 38 years of service in the intelligence business from both a civilian and a military perspective, I am intimately familiar with the training program described in this book not only as former instructor but also (and later) as one of its managers.While I could nit pick this thing do death, I'll raise only a few questions that challenge the veracity of its contents.First, in my not so humble opinion the segment regarding remote delivery bugs (no pun intended), p. 17, such as the ""dragon fly"" is pure fiction given microphone technology (not to mention  battery technology as well as laser technology) 40 years prior to Class 11.  Back then, we would have needed a Stork and a diaper to deliver  the dragonfly to its intended target.  And what about the Agency, with all of its resources, needing the author to gratuitously get it a ""real dragonfly"" to put on its demo board.  Give me a break!Second, the segment, p.54, regarding car surveillance training is ludicrous.  The author relates having been shown pictures of purported car crashes from previous class mishaps that calls to my mind a picture resembling a demolition derby.  Consider the potential impact, if true, of the property damage, personal injury, and possible death to US citizens, not to mention court battles, as a result of a classified training program undertaken by a secret organization of the US Government having ""deep pockets""--a veritable personal injury lawyer's paradise.  Allen Dulles would be turning over in his grave were this a true case.Third, the segment, p. 223, regarding disguises is almost as bad, if not worse, than the one above.  From the author's description of events one would think the Agency has turned loose a group of trainees going to a Halloween party in a mall of all places.  This whole segment discredits the fine work of the men and women in the ""disguise department"" who are nothing but professional.  The bit about the police officer who immediately connects the trainees to the Farm as a result of their disguises is even too much for my imagination to accept.I'd give this book half a star, were it possible, so as not to denigrate my fallen colleagues whose stars appear on a wall as the author describes on page four of his book.  Upon completion of this book, which I found to be a challenge, I come away with a feeling that the author has mastered the art of ""Bovine Excrement.""  I'm convinced it was an art that he had honed long before he joined the Agency in a career that was far too long in my ""not so humble"" opinion.",1
"An outstanding collection of daily entries on hiking and climbing expeditions, where Kerouac, Whalen and others go up Mt. Crater, on Buddhist and Hindu ideas, on his trip to India with Orlovsky and Ginsberg and near the end of this journal; some essays on the new emerging psychedelic subculture - the 1967 Human Be-In, the subculture which existed throughout antiquity of the Gnosis, mystics, community and tribe. The idea of a matrilineal society, tribal, indigenous and I can so much relate to this type of open consciousness, the opening of the doors of perception in nature and mother earth and loving each other in emptiness - concept free- moments of the mind. I was also moved by his experience in an Ashram on a Japanese Island.It's the year 2006 and its all new material for me. It seems I personally know Snyder when reading this. Much of the beats bring you right with them. I see what moved John Suiter in his ""Poets Peaks,"" as I am hiking up New Jersey and New York Mountains I can feel much of these words. I only regret that I was not with Snyder and the beats, that I have not been in certain areas of the East, that I was not with the later tribal communities; such communities that were far removed from today's one-sided Manichean society. The difference is in the level of consciousness; one aware of role playing identities, the other lost in subjectivity.""A lot of it is simply being aware of the clouds and wind.""",1
"I've been looking for this movie forever , I saw it like 5 or 6 years ago on tv and I got completely hooked on it,It was really impresive, it may seem kind of arty nowadays but it has segments witch you'll see later in taxi driver, there is also a very unpleaseant scene which involves some kind of street theatre ..., I definetely recommend this movie to Brian de Palma aficionados and lovers of strong performances.",0
"This book had a profound effect my life as a writer.My mother read it to  me at night like fairy tales when I was very young. As I grew up and  realized I wanted to write professionally, the lessons in The Big Sea made  the writing life seem not only possible, but the best life a person could  find. I would say without a doubt that this is my favorite book of all  time. If I was marooned on a desert island, this would be the book I would  take with me. From his base in Harlem, it shows Hughes embracing the whole  world. The Big Sea is a book to read and treasure. again and again",1
"This is a great little book, and a quick read. However, it is packed full of historical facts and interesting people. What is most authentic about the book in my opinion is the depiction of Catholic life in Waterbury and New Haven at the turn of the last century. While times have certainly changed in 100 years, they haven't changed all that much. I spent quite a bit of time in Waterbury growing up, and I could almost feel the environment Fr. McGiveny grew up in. As I read, I became nostalgic. I am a Knight, and the story of how the Knights began is personal and inspiring for me. I hope many read the book and consider joining the Knights. If non-Catholics read the book, I hope they consider joining other civic organizations. As Dr. Robert Putnam of Harvard University has pointed out in his excellent book ""Bowling Alone,"" (which mentions the Knights and has a chart on Knights membership rates) social capital in this country has been in steep decline for the past 50 years. We must reinvigorate our great civic organizations to reclaim this source of social capital. Many folks who graduate college today and get jobs experience profound loneliness once they move away from the academic setting. This loneliness that characterizes modern life was not the norm 50 years ago or more. We are suffering and leading poorer lives because of a lack of social capital. Fr. Michael McGivney was ""just"" a parish priest. However, he saw the need men had to connect with each other and spend time with each other. He saw that young Catholic men were being lured away by secret societies that at times sought to remove them from the Church. He saw that Catholic men seeking to make their way in a new and often hostile country needed a way to build social capital AND keep the faith, for if they lost the faith, the consequences were eternal. He provided all of this, even while he transformed the lives of millions of Catholic families, giving them access to Life Insurance and other benefits for the first time. Today, he is known as the man who founded what became one of the wealthiest civic organizations the world has ever seen. The Knights give millions away every year to charity and have billions in assets. They are, by all accounts, the largest private and religious charitable organization in the entire world. Ultimately though, all this is not the best reason to buy the book and read it. At its core, this is just a biography of one good man who became one good and holy priest. At times like ours we are in need of reminders of what good and holy priests look like, act like, and achieve. Thank God the authors gave us such a portrait at such an important time.",1

"In recent years, there has been a great deal of emphasis on Polish anti-Semitism. This is despite the fact that anti-Semitism  existed virtually everywhere, and in Poland never approached the level which Jews encounted in many other European nations. Moreover, the positive aspects of Polish-Jewish relationships have been virtually ignored. Pogonowski's excellent book does much to show, in fact, how Jewish communities flourished in Poland",1

"This is simply the best book about the begining of American psychology. It tells about how James moved psychology from a ""nasty little science"" into a respectable profession aimed at practical use and clinical utility for any who could benefit from it. This book shows how James merged his empirical sciences with his deep love of philosophy to help give rise to the modern American thought of putting knowledge to use. James would say that worrying if the color blue is the same experience for all observers was a waste of time, thought, and energy. He rejected the European study of introspection and desired to use the scientific method to study everything, but yet realized that science may only end up being a small slice of what is really governing the universe. His views on free will are fascinating. He at some level, believes there is no free will, yet insists that we should all live as if there were - even if we know it's mere illusion - it's an illusion worth investing ourselves into. The famous quote that one should ""..act as if they have faith and then faith will be given to them."" is an inspiring message that has helped so many endure and believe in the ""will"" to change one's self by changing our thoughts. He comments that the greatest discovery of his generation was that a man could change himself by changing his attitudes and beliefs and in-turn those new beliefs begin to possess us and we become what we ""will"" ourselves to become. Do not be put off by the length of this book. It's a very easy read and is arranged so that you can shift from place to place and not lose anything by bouncing around. James' idea of the ""Stream of Consciousness"" is so well a part of our culture it's hard to believe we once thought otherwise. I am a psychologist and would recommend this book to anyone who wants to see how the Mental Health movement began with James and his demanding that science must benefit if it is to be worthy of our investigation. His radical empiricism is the basis for so much of what we take as ""proof"" of facts. Yet he warns not to fall in love with the scientific method, lest we miss a rare non-repeating miracle. He was, indeed, the very embodiment of that thought - a rare man whose gave us such wonderful tools and thoughts that he still speaks to us almost 100 years after his death - I call that miraculous. I hope you enjoy this book and I recommend it without reservation.",1
"I loved this film. But you may very well not like it at all. Answering a couple quick questions will help you know whether you should stay away from Eight Crazy Nights: Can anything in an artwork offend you? Be honest here; there's nothing wrong with you if you can be offended by content. If you're the kind of person who might say, ""I normally don't mind (or I even like) crude humor, but that just went too far"", then the answer is ""yes"". If you think that an artwork can go too far, if you have any personal sacred cows, then be very cautious of watching Eight Crazy Nights.Next, do you like to think of yourself as being more mature than you were as, say, a 13 year old? I don't just mean, ""Are you more mature"", but do you pride yourself on that, so that you don't find joy in playing 13-year-old again. If yes, that's another indicator for caution.And finally, for people who actually are teens and who answered ""No"" to the above questions, do you dislike your crude humor to have any positive messages or sentimentality? If yes, use caution.It's not that Eight Crazy Nights is the most outrageous, risk-taking, potentially offensive comedy ever, or that it's constantly juvenile or ever over-the-top sappy. For offense and maturity, there's nothing here that's not found in the average episode of South Park. But maybe because it's an animated holiday film where many people aren't expecting something like South Park, a lot of viewers--especially the offendable and proudly sophisticated--have turned up their noses.Eight Crazy Nights is actually quite complex and sophisticated on many artistic levels. The animation is exceptionally well done--at least as good and complex as most Disney features. For example, there are many subtle layering and perspective effects, similar to Disney's multiplane approach, and often mimicking ""live action"" cameras, so that different focal depths will be blurred. The environments are lush and subtly modeled. Characters are fluid and well drawn. There are many difficult sequences, such as action and sports scenes, and they're all very impressive.Script-wise, Adam Sandler achieved a film that both mocks/spoofs traditional holiday films and manages to be one at the same time. It's not that different in theory from, say, Elf or Bad Santa, except that Sandler isn't at all afraid to continually go for the throat in his brand of humor (which isn't to suggest that Elf or Bad Santa are bad films--I love both of them, and especially Bad Santa goes for the throat sometimes, too). The plot has some similarities to A Christmas Carol in that the main character, Davey (voiced by Sandler), has an over-the-top, bitter, bah-humbug attitude about the holidays brought on by past events. Davey is even visited by something akin to supernatural entities at one point.Sandler's music and music performances are impressive. The focus is on silly/funny lyrics, of course, but at times, his singing and songwriting skills suggest that he could have easily had a career in the music business instead. While watching Eight Crazy Nights I kept thinking how much I'd like to see a Sandler penned Broadway show--that would be just the thing to help knock Broadway out of its frustrating musical and content conservatism.A couple characters, especially Whitey (also voiced by Sandler), take some getting used to. Sandler is doing one of his odd, affected voices for the character, and Whitey is designed to be disturbing and disagreeable. But of course the joke is that he's the symbol of positive holiday spirit, so Sandler is again pulling the rug out from beneath our expectations--something he does regularly, in many different ways, throughout the course of Eight Crazy Nights--and that's a good thing.",0
"  The Forerunner 101 is extremely accurate and fun to use.  Verified it several times.  Advantages are low cost, buy your own rechargeable batteries and don't have to worry about lithiums or replacements.

"I'm great at losing weight. Just ask Jenny Craig and the Metabolic Weight Loss Centre. But it wasn't until I read Dr. Clower's ""The Fat Fallacy"" that I finally learned exactly what I needed to know to not only lose my excess weight but to keep it off. One of the other reviewers complained that Dr. Clower couldn't get to the point. Dr. Clower lays the groundwork for his proposed lifestyle in the first half of the book, and then spends the next half telling you exactly what to do. I found the book easy to read and understand, and highly enjoyable (I had a lady ask me what comic book I was reading 'cause I was chuckling so much--Dr. Clower has a great sense of humor.) If you take what this book says  to heart, your eyes will be opened to the junk food Americans consume, all in the name of fat-free or low-fat eating. Liberate yourself from your weight-manic obsession (if that's what you suffer from) and buy this book, read it, and live it",1
"We purchased this dollhouse for our three year old daugther last July when she turned three.  Fortunately, at the time, I went a bit crazy with ordering the furniture and bought almost all of the furniture sets that were made to activate the Sweet Sounds dollhouse.  I just recently discovered, however, that you cannot buy the Loving Family furniture that was made for the dollhouse in the department/toy stores. Instead, you have to buy it for three to five times the original price from an individual on eBay (i.e., $54 and up for one set which originally cost $12).  If you do decide to buy this dollhouse, the furniture that you actually need to activate some of the 200 phrases must contain an item called a ""BONUS FEATURE"".  The BONUS FEATURE are furniture sets that come with a certain furniture item (i.e., wrapped gifts and balloons, parrot, blue television, tea set, blue teddy bear) that has a PINK or BLUE ribbon attached.  Those items will activate the dollhouse sounds.  Yes, you can still buy doll furniture from Fisher Price for the Twin Times Fisher Price Dollhouse that are on the same size scale as the Sweet Sounds dollhouse, but that furniture will not activate the dollhouse's supposed 200 phrases.Personally, I think it is an atrocity that Fisher Price continues to sell this dollhouse with the marketing claim that it has over 200 phrases.  A majority of those so-called phrases are activated by the extra dollhouse furniture that you USED to be able to purchase.  Hence, the claim that Fisher Price (aka Mattel) makes that the dollhouse has over 200 phrases is misleading and false advertising because the dollhouse only comes with a few pieces to activate the dollhouse sounds (i.e., adult female, adult male, child female, cat, and tape recorder).  That's it!  Someone else put together a list of all the sets you used to be able to purchase so you can see what I'm talking about here (although the representative picture of the displayed furniture on the left is not always the same item as the boxed picture on the right -- the boxed picture on the right shows the correct furniture to activate the dollhouse).  Please see:  http://mydreamdollhouse.com/FPdollhouse_sweet_sounds.htmlObviously, Fisher Price and/or Mattel believe that as parents we are stupid and that we don't pay attention to details. They have incorrectly assumed that we will not recognize that although they sell the Sweet Sounds dollhouse (probably because they have a lot left to deplete in their inventory), they don't sell the corresponding furniture to activate the house.  Why then spend the extra $20 pay for the electronic dollhouse sounds when you can purchase the Fisher Price Twin Times dollhouse for much less?Although I already own almost all of the Sweet Sounds dollhouse furniture sets, I have now developed a great disdain for the unscrupulous business dealings of the manufacturer who no longer supply the corresponding furniture for this Sweet Sounds dollhouse.Lastly, today I contacted a supervisor within Mattel's customer service (1-800-432-5437).  Although she was very nice, I could hardly believe that their computer datebase does not reflect that the corresponding activating furniture has been discontinued.  She was totally unaware that people across the globe cannot purchase it anywhere but on eBay at a ridiculous prices.  I did not realize when I spoke to her that there was this message board with so many complaints in this regard, however, I pointed out to her that I have been unable to find the furniture sets (with the ""BONUS FEATURE"") in any in the stores and that everyone on eBay is bidding them up three to five times the original price (I think that was fairly convincing to her).  Dare I say that the omittance of the word ""DISCONTINUED"" in Mattel's database was completely purposeful because they don't want their customer service representatives telling the consumers that you we can no longer get the activating furniture because they want you to buy up the inventory of remaining dollhouses!  I'm sorry, Fisher Price, but not all parents are quite as dumb as you think they are.For a mother with two toddler girls ages 2 and 3, I am going to boycott Fisher-Price altogether because I think this is unscrupulously deceptive marketing on their part.  I cannot return all of the unopened furniture sets and the Sweet Sounds dollhouse, but I certainly will continue to raise an awareness via the Internet.Final word:  If you don't care whether or not the dollhouse makes sounds and talks, then go ahead and spend the extra money, although the feature is otherwise useless.  In truth, you're wasting your money because you can buy another dollhouse that doesn't have electronic sounds for considerably less money.Signed,MAD AS HECK AT MATTEL IN SUNNYVALE, CALIFORNI",0
"I bought these candles in the store.  When I got home, I set everything up and lit the candles.  In less that 30 minutes, all 5 candles had burned to half way, and the strings the medals are on had caught on fire too.  The entire thing was on fire (a big fire).  I was able to blow it out, and take it outside to the trash can.  I have bought Target candles before, and love them.  I am not happy!!",0
"Timothy Zahn has done what few authors in the history of a body of literature such as Star Wars has done: He has created a character, independent of anything shown in the movies, that has taken on a life of his own. The original Thrawn trilogy was the first of the Star Wars books I got a hold of when I was younger and they had an intensity about them that has only recently been matched by The New Jedi Order and The Legacy of the Force.In Outbound Flight, Zahn takes you back to where it all began. He shows you the root of the clone C'Boath's madness, sets up a couple of secondary characters in a manner that you don't fully realize until the end of the novel, and drops a bombshell about the coming Yuzhaan Vong invasion that was quite shocking.When Zahn introduces Thrawn for the first time, its a moment that almost gives the reader chills. He does so with a hint at what Thrawn will some day become and, throughout the novel, shows off Thrawn's brilliance and tactical prowess to an impressive degree.As a side note, this is one of the first books, at least for me, that really reveals the depth of Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious/The Emperor's duplicity. It really opens your eyes to just how much he manipulated things.All in all, an excellent book for anyone who has never met Thrawn before and even those who are old friends with the Grand Admiral. It's a very, very satisfying read and I'm anxiously looking forward to the arrival of Zahn's next Star Wars installment, Alliance",1
Solves the infinities problem that has plagued QFT since the 1940's. This book takes a pedagogic approach that seems designed to show that its form of QFT is very much like QFT except for short distance modifications that eliminate all infinities in Feynman graph calculations. It is based on a 6-dimensional spacetime with the two extra spatial dimensions quantized. Uses both a standard canonical approach as well as path integrals. I recommend it to those interested in QFT,1
"This is an utterly delightful look at family life circa 1930's South Australia among the immigrant German community. The acting is so good, the characters seem totally real,  and the storyline is gripping. Each of the 6 episodes builds on the previous ones, but is an entire story in itself. From a mischievious, prank-prone boy, we watch the development and growth of Bruno, the main caharcter, as he turns into a responsible, moral and hardworking young man, This is good old fashiioned family entertainment, the way old Disney pictures were. Highly recommended",0
"Finally someone has written it -a book that explains the Alexander Technique (AT) in a warm, generous style, and also offers simple and sophisticated integrations of AT into voice work.This book is also a terrific introduction to bel canto singing with a foundation in voice science.Clear textual explanations are enriched in multiple ways, making this book user-friendly for people with a variety of learning styles. There are dozens of anatomical sketches, photos of human figures in motion and diagrams. Sidebar stories of students learning the AT and achieving vocal victory abound. A few poems dot the manuscript. There are numerous ""to do's"" (vocal explorations) to conduct alone or with a partner. Musical exercises are written in notation with ample explanation. There is a companion CD, most helpful with its piano accompaniment. Could one have asked for more? There is even a diagram of a keyboard with note names.One can learn neither singing nor the AT entirely from a book, but this one gives the reader ample information and suggestions that will support self study for weeks and even months.",1

"I taped The Petrified Forest a couple of years ago when it was shown on TCM and I thought it was a very good movie! Bette Davis plays a young woman who lives in a desert town with her father and works as a waitress in his desert cafe, she is bored and would love to leave home and go see the world! A disillusioned writer played by Leslie Howard stops at the cafe and she falls for him but when a criminal played by Humphrey Bogart and his gang are on the run from the law they hide out in the cafe and hold everyone hostage. This is a good movie and I like that Bette Davis is playing a nice girl who is sweet and compassionate when it seems that she was generally known for playing ruthless, cold and calcuating women so this is a nice change. I'm pleased that this movie is finally on DVD and I recommend it to any fan of Bette Davis, Leslie Howard and classic movies",0

"As always the latest compilation in this annual science fiction anthology remains one of the great anthologies as the current entries are top rate.  For the most part, the thirty contributions are superb tales from a who's who of the genre.  Especially fascinating is Paul McAuley's creative entry ""The Two Dicks,"" in which Philip K. Dick writes mainstream fiction until he meets Richard Nixon.  Other stories are well written as Gardner Dozier scores again with selections that run the gamut from alternative realties to artificial intelligence to ""animal"" intelligence that worms its way into the reader's mind.  The introduction by Mr. Dozier provides a ""Summation"" of the trends in the year, which can be summarized as ""stable"".

"I only ever saw my father cry twice - the first time was when he accidentally burned himself and was in severe pain, and the second time was at his father's funeral. Now that my father has died, just a week ago, I feel as though a part of my world has come crashing down before me...or perhaps behind me.This wonderful book is a look at how the loss of a father can affect a man. Based on a nationwide survey of over 300 men, with in-depth interviews of 70 others, the book is a wonderful resource. The first part of the book contains four chapters which tell of how sons of different age brackets (0-17, 18-32, 33-55, and 56 & up) dealt with the loss of their fathers. The second part of the book covers everything from preparing for fatherloss, through mourning, how spouses can help, and advice on affectionate fathering. And, sprinkled throughout are short reports of how famous men felt about the loss of their fathers, including Michael Jordan, Mahatma Gandhi, and Dwight D. Eisenhower.Overall, I found this to be a wonderful resource. I have read a number of books on men (Iron John, and so forth), but this is one of the most profound books I have ever read. My one complaint about it is that I did not get a hold of this book until after my father had passed. I wish I had read it much earlier!Don't get me wrong, all sorts of relationships are covered, including how men who had distant or fractured relationships with their fathers dealt with the mourning. It truly has something for everyone.So, if you are a man with a living father, then I would recommend you get this book in preparation for the loss that will inevitably come. Or, if you are a wife, and wish to prepare yourself for what your husband will face and feel and need, then this book is for you. I give this book my highest recommendations",1
"What a sweet book!  It is obvious the author is coming from a very loving heart toward his fellow man.  What a delicious approach he has to walking!  The book is very short and can be read in one sitting and has delightful illustrations that carry the mood of the words.  After reading it, I found myself using the simple principles given in the book for making walking more of a mindful meditation rather than a race for time.  I would recommend it to anyone who finds value in stopping to smell the roses",1
"I saw Carole King on the Living Room Tour, and I am so glad I did. It was just her, the piano, her longtime guitarist Rudy Guess, and Gary Burr, a very talented guitarist, singer and songwriter in his own right - in a ""living room"" kind of setting. That's it - just the three of them. This CD brings it all back - ""Where You Lead,"" with Carole's daughter Louise Goffin, the rocking acoustic ""Jazzman,"" the ""Gerry Goffin/Carole King Medley"" (LOTS of wonderful songs included - some I didn't know they had co-written), a great acoustic version of ""Smackwater Jack,"" and a haunting ""Now and Forever,"" which makes me cry every time I hear it. The only one missing here is ""Been to Canaan,"" which she played the night I saw her, but otherwise, it's wonderful. No matter what some of the other reviewers here say, this is a great way to hear and see any musician - without the full band, in their living room, where it all begins. Thanks, Carole, for sharing this.       ",0
"""Mindset. Efficiency. Connections,"" writes the author on page 1. Mindset: If solid earnings are important to you, think of yourself as a business person whose business happens to be writing, explains James-Enger. A simple, yet powerful statement. Forget about your great American novel, at least as it pertains to income. Write what your clients need, end of story. Those clients may be editors or corporate managers. No matter. Seek their business, meet their needs, and some will become repeat customers.Efficiency is essential to making this happen. James-Enger explains how to create templates, reslant stories, and monitor your hourly rate so you know what you're actually earning.Connections: James-Enger shows writers how to establish and maintain connections in the sometimes chaotic world of freelance. The serious freelancer will benefit greatly from SFF. Those contemplating freelancing as a possible career would be well advised to read SFF to see what's involved and whether it's right for them.",1
"Quartet recordings led by a trumpeter are not all that common,  but this is the third such CD Brian Lynch has made for Sharp Nine. Along with the others, this one is a definite winner. The title ""Brian Lynch Meets Bill Charlap"" suggests that this is their first musical meeting, but in fact the trumpeter and pianist have been long-time members of the Phil Woods Quintet, and their musical chemistry is apparent throughout the CD. This is most evident on the duet version of ""Come Rain or Come Shine."" One may characterize the overall mood of this CD as somewhat reflective, but the music never lacks focus or intensity.  The style of the music strongly reflects Charlap's influence. It is quietly intense, never knocking you out with overt technical fireworks (though both Lynch and Charlap are masters of their instruments), but touching your heart and mind with lyrical, well-shaped solos. Six of the CD's nine selections are standards, while three are Lynch originals which fit right in with overall feeling of the date.The album begins with a 7/4 version of ""Green Dolphin Street."" Lynch's muted trumpet brings Miles Davis to mind here. Lynch's  own personality comes through more strongly on the remaining cuts, beginning with the lyrical ballad ""Autumn Nocture"" which features Brian on flugelhorn. ""Artas de Portas"" gets a deeply moving interpretation from Lynch and Charlap. Even when the group turns up the heat on ""My Heart Stood Still"" (a genuine highlight of the CD), Charlie Parker's ""Cheryl"", or Lynch's boppish ""On the Dot"", the mature lyrism remains. The date ends strongly with Lynch's satisfying mid-tempo ""Blues for Gilad."" But every track on this CD has much to commend it, drawing you in and holding your attention.  Furthermore, this is not just a blowing date. Care has been been taken in the arrangements to ensure variety throughout the 62 minute CD. The rhythm duo of bassist Dwayne Burno and drummer Joe Farnsworth is always swinging and tasteful. Farnsworth plays a ear-catching solo with brushes on ""Cheryl.""  As with all of Sharp Nine's releases, the recording quality, graphics, and liner notes (by Phil Woods, in this case) are top-rate. ""Brian Lynch Meets Bill Charlap"" is highly recommended  to all who enjoy lyrical, thoughtful jazz",0
"This was exactly the kind of book for a person who doesn't know much about computers, but wants to learn.  It was truly empowering to put together something that I previously had no knowledge of.  It felt empowering, especially after my Dell laptop crashed 3 months after the warranty expired.  I'm learning more about computers, but I needed the help from this book, which puts computer building into simple language most people can understand",1
"Having been a trumpet player and Harry James fan for many years, I was delighted to read Trumpet Blues. It was a sorely needed account of a fabulous technician and musician. A great book, very complete, though I  yearned for a little more in the way of comments regarding Harry's  technical approach. There is a nice treatment of Harry's sweet balladry  which drew criticism from the jazz quarter. Because Harry could sell  records by making his trumpet almost speak, as in 'If I Loved You' and  'Sleepy Lagoon' he was thought to be 'too commercial'. What the critics  failed to note, or to even hear, was the emotion in the horn. 'Mona Lisa'  was no less a work than his swing and jazz playing. His high 'e' entrance  in 'If I Loved You' was astonishing. Pick up this book if you are a trumpet  player or a music buff. Well done",1

"I found this book to be excellent because it answered many questions about myself and my past behavior. I have a narcissistic personality and have often wondered why I acted out in such self-destructive ways. He explains how someone's behavior can reveal their true self. This is right on the mark. Everyone has a personality, which is revealed in their speech and their behavior. When someone's speech is different from their behavior, you know they are projecting a false image of their self. People who project false images of their self are naricisstic. Much of Dr. Alexander Lowan's research can be validated by the work done by the FBI's Behavior Science Unit, which was the basis for the popular movie &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; Once you've read Dr. Lowan's book, an excellent follow up book would be Journey Into Darkness by John Douglas, the FBI agent who started the FBI's Behaviorial Science Unit. I can truly say, Dr. Lowan's book saved my life and helped me change my behavior and find happiness with my self. This book is a must read for anyone who is in denial of their true self",1
"I just finished reading this book and I thought the coverage of Marley's musical life and progression was excellent.

"The novel Single Mom by Omar Tyree is a rather interesting book. I feel easily enticed into the lives of the characters in the story. I also feel as though I can relate to the situation of the main character, Denise. I believe this because a single mother rears me. I am glad that Omar Tyree decided to write a story based on the hardships of a single mother. Another thing that I admire about this book is the way the author describes the personalities and lifestyles of his characters throughout the entire book. Usually the author describes his characters at the beginning of the story only. In this novel, if you were to only read a segment you would not be capable of fully understanding the characters and their motivations. Though I have not yet completed all of Single Mom by Omar Tyree, I still feel that is an interesting book to read. I am enjoying it and I think that others will as well. In my opinion, I recommend that you go out and get it because it is very good",1

"There is important information in this book but most of us need to see numerical examples to reinforce theoretical concepts. This book really comes up short in this area. It provides some discussion with the formulas/equations it presents but is very incomplete in terms of worked out examples.  Yes, including worked out examples might  might mean a book three times  as long, but the book would then be many, many times more useful to practitioners.As it currently stands the book can only benefit the super-genius-theoretical types who do not need to see examples to understand OR someone who ALREADY really understands the concepts.The book rather frequently presents variables or constants without explicitly defining them for the reader (it assumes we know what they mean from the accompanying discussion).The book gives exercises, but without answers what good are these?The one thing the book does is make you realize there is a lot you do not know. You can find  ideas in portfolio management that exist by reading this book but if you are at all like me you are going to have to look elsewhere for the answers. I have had better luck with Google searches for stuff like Style Analysis.The book shows how smart the authors are: they know stuff that must of us do not. Unfortunately this is the feeling I get as I read sections of their book. They intend to keep it this way. Bottom line: the book fails to bridge the gap between theory and practice",1
"This book is an outstanding resource for anyone interested in learning about developing and fostering creativity. Mario Pricken's techniques focus on applications in creative advertising. However, both his ""DreamTeam"" group work techniques and his ""KickStart Catalogue"" are valuable tools for creating novel ideas in any field. Pricken supports his techniques and theories with stunning visuals from award-winning campaigns from around the globe. He stresses the importance of applying his techniques, specifically the ""DreamTeam"", in creating advertisements that deliver results. The bulk of Pricken's material is composed of the ""KickStart Catalogue"". This section outlines numerous creative techniques that can be used to elicit novel ideas. The author backs up each one of these techniques with applications to creative advertising. The purpose of the section is to act partly as a guide for creative thinking and to act partly as inspiration for new ideas. The ""DreamTeam"" guidelines are a great resource for encouraging creative thought in groups. In this section, Pricken outlines what is needed in a work environment to build creativity instead of breaking it down. Additionally, the author outlines other classic creative techniques that can be applied to all fields including creative advertising. He recounts timeless techniques including storyboarding, first developed by Walt Disney in the early 20th century. Pricken delivers a stunning finish to his work by outlining several interviews with industry professionals. Marketing professors, graphic designers, account executives, and creative directors in the top of the domain all recount their take on the world of creative advertising. This book's strength lays in its stunning use of visual examples to support the author's somewhat stretching theories. Pricken's careful eye and meticulous research shine through in this work. The only problem with this book is the slight over analysis of some creative techniques. Pricken is guilty of what many marketers often do: over complicate their craft. Many of the theories put forward can be condensed into groups. While his thoughts are well researched and developed, they can be perceived as mechanical interpretations of otherwise innate processes.  I would recommend this book to anyone curious about marketing, communications, or simply anyone who has ever enjoyed a creative advertisement. ",1
"Sasha Kagan's ""Country Inspirations, Knitwear For All Seasons"", the latest inspirational offering from this well-known British knitwear designer, does not disappoint. 	Using the beautiful countryside around her rural Welsh home for inspiration, Ms. Kagan has created an exiting collection of  knitwear.  There is more than enough variation among the design offerings  to delight even the most jaded home knitter. 	Ms. Kagan's stated aim is  to interpret the seasons for knitters from Summer's full-blown roses to  Winter's leaves and berries.  Good full body shots of sweaters on  attractive models with close-ups of interesting details are interspersed  with photos of her botanical inspirations, making an effective  presentation.  Delightful line drawings accompany most of the designs,  adding to the general creative air of this book.  You feel as if somehow  you are getting a private peek into the designer's personal  notebook.   	 The book's layout is both clear and colourful, pairing well-designed charts  with helpful keys that provide just enough colour and stitch detail to make  the actual knitting of these seemingly complex designs manageable.  Helpful  construction and stitch diagrams are provided where necessary, allowing the  knitter to tackle unusual stitch or construction techniques, without the  help of full-body charts.  (There are knitters who find too much chart  reading confusing.) 	Ms. Kagan's ""Country Inspirations"" are divided  into 5 sections: Roses, Autumn Leaves, Meadow Flowers, Forrest Fruits and  Cottage Gardens, with several different designs included under each  heading.  The shapes of the sweaters vary and clever pattern or stitch  details are added to Ms. Kagan's signature colourwork motives, resulting in  a sophisticated mix of both knitterly design and fashionable style.  It is  nice to see this kind of complex knitting paired with a sense of  contemporary style and shape, rather than the more usual boxy  drop-shouldered styling often seen with complex colour or pattern knitting.  	I liked the combination of simple intarsia designs with stitch and texture  patterns, creating complex looking garments that are really simpler to knit  than is apparent from the rich end result.  If you don't feel like knitting  a whole sweater, but are still inspired by the Welsh countryside, there are  several afghan and pillow designs that will allow you to try out the  combination of colour and stitch pattern without having to worry about  complex shaping. 	The inspiration Ms. Kagan gains from her surroundings  in Wales and the delight she experiences from a colourful piece of  handknitted goods comes across in this collection.  Even if you never knit  a single design, as actually charted, this book is well worth owning for  its inspirational qualities and delightful presentation.  I suggest you add  it to your collection of knitting books, now",1
"I bought the TV advertised version of this.  After 2 uses a small plastic part broke off the motor rendering the whole kit useless -  I was so disappointed.  Then I bought another one that looked exactly like the first one, but without all the extras. Well, the parts are exactly the same, but the screw on parts (the threads) weren't the same so none of it was interchangeable...more disappointment. This time I did some research first and found the Tribest.  It is fantastic.  Best of all buy the adapter so you can use canning jars to grind into, and if you have a vacuum packer, you can then vacuum pack what you've ground.  I no longer throw away fresh garlic, or onions, or parsley, etc.  From vacuum to freezer...fantastic",0
"It is unfortunate that the first reviewer of this book is so negative.  She (he?) states that it is poorly written but never gives concrete examples of the poor writing.  The reviewer says the book is poorly organized, but they begin with chapters identifying what constitutes a healthy/happy relationship and what does not.  Most of us grew up on TV and movies to inform us about romance, but rarely showing how people effectively manage the trickier day to day coping and growing in a marriage.  The Friels begin by setting the record straight about what can we realistically expect.  How do we make our selves feel good with that very imperfect partner of ours.  One way is by owning our own part of the problems.  Much easier for  any of us to talk about than to really act on.  The book is divided up into sections that cover points that I think most of have to learn about, because these ideas are not common knowledge.  A couple examples are entitled, Be Willing to Divorce, and Let Disappointment Enrich You.  The first reviewer seems to think that the book's ideas are too warm and fuzzy.  I would suggest that if you have the courage and ability  to really understand the depth of what they are saying, you have an opportunity to make profound changes in your relationship.  And if you end up with more warm and fuzzy feeling in your relationship, since most of have enough frustration, wouldn't more warm and fuzzy feelings be a good thing",1

Yes, it's complex and not the standard ""Eliot's favorite toothpaste was Crest"" kind of minutiae that seldom are more than compendiums of trivia.

Louise helps to make the right choices and to believe. Afterall, she never finished high school and came from an abused home. Look at her success. One day I hope I am fortunate enough to meet her",1
"More than 20 books later, Sharon is still the best female PI out there.It took way too long for this one to come out. As much as I enjoyed ""Point Deception"" and ""Cyanide Wells,"" I wish Ms. Muller would make a new installment of Sharon her first priority so that we get at least one every year.A few reasons I enjoyed this one so much: - It was nice to take a trip down memory lane and remember some of the old cases. I started reading Sharon many years ago, so I enjoyed having my mind nudged on some of her previous adventures. I may have to go back now and read some of the earlier books again. - Little to no Rae. For some reason, this is the one character in this series to whom I've never been able to warm up. - No Hy smothering. I might be in the minority, but I'm not a fan of Sharon's relationship with Hy, so I was glad there wasn't too much of him in this book. One of the things I love most about Sharon is her independence -- she works hard and takes care of herself. Since Hy entered her life, now we have private planes and second/third homes, and access to the highest tech gadgets and world-class security. It's made Sharon seem a bit less believable. Unfortunately, based on the ending, it looks like this will only increase in the future, and I just hope Ms. Muller keeps it under control and doesn't completely ruin the character.I anxiously look forward to the next book and hope I don't have to wait two years for it",1

"There is a difference between religion and culture, and although it is often difficult to tease them apart, the effort should be made. Ayaan Hirsi Ali has not made much of an attempt in her book, which seems to blame Islam for the shortcomings of Somali culture when it comes to women - and, worse, to imply that Somalia is typical of the Islamic world, which is so diverse that a 'typical' country cannot be found. Sadly, male oppression of women can be found in most parts of the world, including those with no connection to Islam - and men have often twisted religions to justify their treatment of women. One subject she deals with is that of female circumcision in its most extreme form, that of 'female genital mutilation' or FGM. She is correct that FGM is practiced in Somalia, but incorrect in ascribing this custom to Islamic influence. She does point out that FGM preceded Islam, and started in Africa, but doesn't take pains to note that it possibly dates back to ancient Egypt (hence the alternate name of 'Pharaonic circumcision'), and is unknown in most of the Islamic world but practiced in some African countries by animists and Christians as well as Muslims.I am uncomfortable with her writing as a spokesperson for Muslim women, since she doesn't seem to know much about Islam. Incredibly, she doesn't even seem to have read the Qur'an, since she states that Prophet Muhammad wrote about female circumcision in that book. Leaving aside the question of the source of the Qur'an (if she thinks it was written by the Prophet as opposed to being revealed by God, she is no longer a Muslim), the Qur'an in fact never mentions circumcision at all, even male circumcision.  There are also no authentic hadiths (traditions of the Prophet) in which he talks of female circumcision.It disturbs me that Muslim or formerly Muslim women who write books criticizing Islam are immediately lionized in the West, no matter how uninformed these people are. It seems that some Westerners who are already hostile to Islam latch onto these people to support their own prejudices. Others simply don't realize that people like Ali are not necessarily reliable on the subject of the religion.I agree with another reviewer that it would be a better idea to read books by feminists with a deep knowledge of Islam, such as Dr. Leila Ahmed, born and brought up in Egypt and now a professor at Harvard's Divinity School. She too speaks of the oppression of women, but in a more nuanced and informed way. Two of her books are ""Women and Gender in Islam"" and ""A Border Passage,"" the latter the story of her own life in Egypt, England, Abu Dhabi, and the U.S. and the evolution of her thought on feminism and her religion",1

"And I believe him. I sympathized with Tom, as I suspect most viewers do, despite his sociopathic nature. I was only sad about one of his murder victims - Peter. Some of the others become so cocky, sickeningly uppity, that you can't wait for them to get off the screen.  You want Tom to win. He is the underdog, after all, and people get tired of seeing the same sort of people (i.e. Dickie) win over and over again, especially if they don't make much of an effort. And Dickie is a prime example of someone who doesn't have to work but gets everything handed to him, and he doesn't even seem grateful for it. Spoiled. You know the type.In a way, Tom reminds me of Vincent, Ethan Hawke's character from Gattaca. Both are very ambitious. Doing anything and everything to fit in with the ""upper class/superior society,"" desperately trying to cover their tracks, obsessed with getting all the details just right..because the consequences of being found out would be disastrous. Both are fascinating characters but Tom is the one that intrigues me the most. He's so cold with that sick, sly smile on his face - you can't help but wonder what he's plotting, what twisted images he's conjured up.But Tom was a jealous, mad murderer, and Vincent was acting more out of revenge for society's prejudices against the genetically inferior.  One could say that Tom was acting out of revenge as well...revenge for having been born poor when he would rather be of the idle rich class, taking advantage of the best things in life. His self-esteem is so low that he has to pretend to be a dead person in order to feel fulfilled - and I don't think he'll ever be completely fulfilled. He'll always be looking over his shoulder, and a rich identity will not cure unhappiness and the void inside.Italy was a beautiful setting for this movie, adding more culture and depth than many other places, I think. That particular aura of all things foreign helped set the mood to something alluring and dark..Matt Damon's best film.",0

"What would YOU do for true love?  What would you be willing to risk....your job, family, reputation, friends, life?  Diane Haeger, author of five other equally captivating love stories (read them, especially Courtesan!), brings you into the world of Margherita and the famous Raphael Sanzio.  She is a poor, baker's daughter, yet her demeanor early on reveals her spirit, faith, and devotion towards those she loves.  Raphael is a self-absorbed genius who lives for his work...until they meet.  From the very beginning she is far more than he could possibly have imagined in a model or a woman.  She confuses him while she captivates him, and Diane Haeger does an awesome job of drawing you into their world where ""happily-ever-after"" is not easily obtained.  This is NOT a Harlequin romance, but a captivating story about the lengths two lovers will go to for each other.  Theirs is a passionate love story, but it is told with taste and never degrades the passion they felt for each other with tawdry descriptions.  As they are swept away by each other, I found myself captivated by a story that wouldn't let go of me and kept me reading long into the night.  They weren't willing to give up or give in, and that obsession is mirrored in the Haeger's writing that won't let go of you once you start this book.  In a day where we insist on ""happily-ever-after,"" Haeger dares to write the true story of historical lovers whose lives are not so neat and tidy.  She does it in a way that wins the reader to their side.  I felt I knew and loved them after I finished The Ruby Ring because they came alive on the pages.  She does provide closure for the story...what you may ask?  Read this page-turner and find out.  You won't regret it!Ruth Barrineau-Brook",1

"Prfessor Ernst provides a highly intellectual analysis of facts and critics many of the problems that plagues the perception of Islam and Muslims. Supported by a great list of references, ""Following Muhammad"" does not focus on Muhammad's biography, but it is a path to explain many of the issues around the religion of Islam, its followers' history, practice and many myth. ""Following Muhammad"" is designed to cut through the fog of suspicion and misinformation. It helps the reader to reach an independent understanding of key themes and historical settings affecting Muslims and non-Muslims around the world. The book attempts to answer questions that may sound simple.Professor Ernst provides a thought-provoking document that stems from a deep understanding of many of the basic methods in analysis of biographical and historical facts about a very high profile personality like the prophet of Islam in addition to a fair look at other religions.  Professor Ernst is a great authority on many of the religious and cultural issues that make the connection to many contemporary issues seamless. He provides application of facts to Islam, Christianity and Judaism and compares perceptions based on the history and practice of each religion. This book states the thesis that Muslims are Human beings! meaning that they have history and that they live in multiple social and historical situations defined by economic class, ethnicity/gender and all the factors that ordinary human beings has to deal with. He puts many of stereotypes about Islam in cultural contest relevant to other beliefs and practices.What does it mean to be a Muslim today? Who has the authority to define Islam? ""Is the responsibility of those who consider themselves Muslims?"".  ""It is the responsibility of none Muslims to acknowledge the legitimacy of that enterprise.""Selected quotations:Tolerance of other religions: P46: &#34;PreIslamic pegan groups still exist today in some Muslim countries. 3000 members of the Kalash trace their descent form the soldiers of Alexander the great and practice polytheism.&#34; &#34;Unlike Christian European, Muslim society has no equivalent to the inquisition to implement a systematic policy of repression of religious minorities.

"I allowed myself to be seduced by this juicer's unique good looks and vendor propaganda regarding its sturdy cast-iron construction.Well, I juiced exactly _3_ 3-inch diameter oranges.  On the 4th orange, a critical cast-iron piece on one of the 2 right-hand hinges broke.Other review comments concerning difficulty of cleanup are accurate.  I would add that the metal strainer has edges that seemed quite sharp, making cleanup potentially dangerous.I would not recommend this juicer under any circumstances",0
"This album stops a bit early in the Eagles' career, just before the release of ""Hotel California,"" and that's to its advantage because there isn't a dud on the album. After this, it was hit or miss for them. The standouts here are ""One of These Nights,"" ""Best of My Love,"" and the underrated, overlooked, and totally awesome ""Tequila Sunrise."" Great music for singing along in the car (especially the doo-doo-doos at the end of ""Peaceful Easy Feeling"")",0

"This album is great.  The first cd is great, and the extra tracks are really pretty good.   The second cd is pretty good too, and it is interesting to hear some classic Marley remixed (ex. Buffalo Soldier).   The second cd is worth the money, as are the two extra tracks.   The packaging and liner notes are great, so if you're looking for some good, all-inclusive Bob Marley music, go with this album.   Personal favorite: &quot;No Woman, No Cry.&quot;  Even for the casual fan, this is the perfect album.   I liked it so much, I just recently bought it on vinyl for a more authentic sound.   Definetely buy this cd",0

"When I got into gardening and especially with planting with native plants I started to pay a lot of attention to the latin names - but I didn't really understand what they meant. Hanging out with an older, very wise friend and his wife, we got talking about ceratin plants and they were rattling off the latin names and their meanings.  It was amazing and so poetic that I wanted to learn more so I found this book.  Its really been a great asset.  Its set up alphabetically by latin name, and for each word, its less of a definition, more of a translation, e.g. palliflavens = pale yellow, squamosus = full of scales.  Its a neat book - not as poetic in the translations as I had hoped but interesting nonetheless",1

"Listen, Ms. Eisenberg, let's get the facts.  There was no bullying, and it was not America that divided Germany.  It was one man, and only one man, that allowed Russia to go into Berlin and divide the city even though our military should have been the military to go in.  That man,  a demented Roosevelt that should never have been allowed in office for four terms,  acted contrary to every sensible leader's position in the U.S.  To even remotely claim that America made this decision is not only not acceptable, it is untenable, and should be deeply repented of.  It is my opinion that you have made this position to sell a book, and to earn dollars doing it",1
"I had a lot of fun watching Disney's remake of Freaky Friday. In some ways this updated version improves on the themes of the original 1970's version. Funny and smart, Disney's Freaky Friday makes a great date movie or a great family movie.The story follows a family days before a widow's wedding to her new fiancé. Daughter and mother are at odds with each other over the upcoming nuptials A trip to the Chinese restaurant and a fortune cookie lead to daughter and mother switching bodies and experiencing each other's lives. It's only when they come to appreciate each other that things change back. I know I'm leaving a lot out; (I usually write detailed synopses in my reviews) but I really want people to watch this movie and experience it for themselves. Disney's Freaky Friday is JUST TOO GOOD TO SPOILThis movie is a lot of fun; the jokes are hilarious and the music is great. My favorite scenes are the collision in the bedroom between Anna and her Mother. I also liked the talk show sequence and the scenes in the car with some McDonald's fries (I can relate.) Really funny stuff. The updated script is well written and the cinematography is solid.Disney did a great job of casting their version of Freaky Friday. Each actor and actress is perfectly cast in their roles. Lindsay Lohan gives a strong performance as Anna. For a young actress she handles the dual role very well, making both a convincing teenager and middle aged woman trapped in a teenage body. Jamie Lee Curtis is hilarious in this movie. Her performance here is worth the purchase of the DVD alone; the way she transitions from middle aged woman to hot teenager trapped in a middle aged woman's body are incredible. Her scenes with Chad Michael Murray made the movie for me. I could actually feel the chemistry swirling between them. She needs to be in more movies; I love watching her perform. Chad Michael Murray is in top form here as Anna's love interest. They need to let him do more on One Tree Hill. Veteran actor Harold Gould gets some great lines in some key scenes. Mark Harmon (NCIS) is a surprise as the mom's love interest. Nice to see him playing something light and funny for once. Look for Christina Vidal as Anna's bandmate. Both versions of Freaky Friday are Shawn James five star Essential Movies. After almost 30 years the story is on its way to becoming a modern classic. While you're buying this one pick up the original 1970's version and the great book both movies are based on.",0
"This is one of those rare films that last for nearly three hours and keeps your attention for every second. The battle scenes were shot brilliantly and the action and acting is riveting. As much as this is a war film, it is also a fantastic character study of an interesting historical figure. Once you start this film, you won't want to turn it off until end",0
"Celine Dion just has such a beautiful voice and the material she has to work with on this album is wonderful. I've listened to all the songs many, many times and my favorites have changed. At this moment I am just blown away by ""With This Tear"". Her interpretation of this song is perfection. I love to get lost in a song and just forget everything that is going on around me. This song does it for me. It is sad but at the same time so hauntingly beautiful. I was surprised to read that Prince wrote this song but it just solidifies my belief that he is a musical genius. Celine Dion is truly one of the most gifted and talented singers to ever walk this earth",0

"I am sitting around one night years ago and my sister comes into the room and hands me these short stories and says ' you gotta read em' cause they got characters in them like Little Augie and Nibsy and ' the Walking Encyclopedia of Baseball Knowledge' and ' Posey' and  'Itchie Samiof ' and all the guys we know from Richman's gambling joint. So I sit down and I begin to read and its like these people on the page are the very spitting image very spitting of those we are meeting every day just on our corner . And these characters are very much like those my Uncles Jack and Reddy are inviting in the house all the time to play pinochle only even more funny and almost as nasty .So I say this book comes out of American life and is the genuine article although someone else tells me a lot of these guys most of been reading Damon Runyan and so started acting and talking like his characters just to make it seem that they are bigshots which is of course what they all are-when they are not broke which is most of the time.Well this has not been a very successful effort at parody or paraphrase or whatever is, but it is a way of saying you will really really enjoy reading about ' Nicely Nicely' and 'Nathan Detroit ' and all the other Runyan characters. Ring Lardner may have been a smarter guy but old Damon Runyan why he  could almost make colloquial as good as old JD Salinger would a little later from a bit further uptown.Try it , try it you'll really really like it.

"This book was given to me as a gift.  A male friend had heard Barbara Wright Abernathy at a speaking engagement and told me ""She says the same things you've been thinking"".  With the book in hand I also took the time to visit the authors website.Have you ever heard someone say ""She wears the pants in that family"", or ""She's one bossy/powerful/in control woman""?  Well, that is the type of woman this book was written for.  Barbara had failed relationships and didn't know why.  This book details her experience and what she and her husband, Stephen, learned together.  Relationships like this aren't for everyone, but there are a lot of us who needed someone to put the idea into writing.No one talks about power levels between partners.  Some partners argue all the time about finances, even though one is clearly more adept at managing money than the other.  With help from this book, I can see where it's possible to have a relationship with clearly defined roles.  Perhaps I get an extra vote when we're tied on a decision.  Or he agrees to always check the 'Honey-Do-List' first thing on a Saturday morning. If you're a strong woman, it helps you figure out how you and your partner can simply clearly define your roles in the relationship.It's been my experience that men love to please their women. This book just brings certain aspects to light and helps women to see and acknowledge the power we DO have..and how to use it in a healthy way for creating happiness in our relationship.This book isn't about living with a Female Dominatrix or involving heavy 'kink' into your home life.  If that's your choice, fine.  But this book is more for the average folks - of which I am one - who would simply like to have their relationship be closer and more loving.  There are more of us powerful women out here than you would think! This book gives me food for thought .. and action.  Thanks Barbara and Stephen",1
"Alright first consider the fact that I was in Florida on the beach, hot surfer guys milling about in front of my eyes and yet I could not tear myself away from this book! Beatrice Lacey is the most fasinating character I have ever read. You will become enthralled by her passion that even as she falls further and further from grace, you still cheer her on. Philippa Gregory is a absulutely wonderful writer, giving  life to this passionate woman. Basically though, it is a story of dark love and a lust for power. It is fantastic, from begining to end. ",1
"""And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"" When I read the New Testament, I find a God of love and compassion. In these books I find a message of hate and fear. Why are so many eager to condemn those around them who don't believe exactly as you do? The history of early Christianity isn't one of a uniform understanding of Christ's message. If even those right after Christ couldn't get is right, why, on earth, do you believe that you understand the exact message of God? I would suggest we all work on bringing ourselves closer to God's love and spend less time imagining the punishment of those who don't conform to our idea of how God wants us to live",1
"When I first saw this book I immediately purchased it at the Scholastic book fair.  I then translated it in French & Spanish (available upon request!).  It makes a great beginning ESL book as is & foreign language pronoun and pronunciation book because of its simple question/answer and comment structure between two buddies, appropriately of different ethnic/racial backgrounds.  Kids really respond to this (& even adults!) in foreign language classrooms, wanting to mimic the dialogue.  I often separate the class (left/right or boys/girls) to do so.  Great fun way to memorize dialogue and learn proper intonation",1

"This reminds me of ""The Web of Life : A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems"" by Fritjof Capra as well as his previous book ""The Turning Point"" on which the movie ""Mindwalk"" (by Bernt Amadeus Capra, with Liv Ullmann, Sam Waterston, and John Heard) was based. The difference is this book is not written by a physicist but by a philosopher whose engagement with her family and her environs is done in beautiful prose. Even an island is not an island.What does it mean to love a person? What does it mean to love a place? The list (p. 35) is interesting and so both are similar. How many things I must love according to this list! But even though they all fit, would I say I really love my car? I suppose I am spoiled by C.S. Lewis' ""The Four Loves"" which I think gives us some wonderful ways of discriminating among different ""loves"" and keeping them clearly different in our minds. I suppose the issue would be in the degree of love -- number nine ""desperately"".My favorite piece was about the bird hiding the nut in the backyard. What a great ending!",1
"I read this book and laughed out loud. Yes, anyone who plays fantasy football (such as yours truly) will enjoy this book as the author decided to give up his career and play fantasy football (luckily, his wife was at least somewhat supportive). The book is a hilarious episode of his life in which he dives into the world of fantasy football and writes of the serious ""over the top"" insanity of the leagues and the big money paid out in various fantasy football leagues.For anyone who plays fantasy football, there isn't a whole lot of new information (the history of how the fantasy football game began is interesting) but the fact that he tries to make a career of it and the constant worry, fear, anxiety, glory and joy of playing fantasy football is familiar to anyone who ""owns"" a fantasy football team.

"This book gives the best creative ideas for discipline.  I've used at least 10 different ones on my girls, because we all know you need to change it up a bit every now and then!  The best idea was the correction jars - one that says ""Pick a Privilege"" and the other says ""Correction Can.""  My girls were able to pick things to put on slips of paper for each jar and then when I saw them doing something good, I could let them pick out of the good jar and when I saw them doing something they shouldn't they had to pick a consequence out of the bad.  It worked brilliantly!  They would go out of their way to do good behaviors so they could get the chance to pick out of the good jar.  I also loved the verses all throughout the book that correlated with the behavior. It gave me specific verses I could show my girls to back up why the behavior was unacceptable",1

"Originally published in 1938, it centers around five brothers who each have a unique quality. The First Chinese Brother has the ability to swallow the sea. The Second Chinese Brother has an iron neck. The Third Chinese Brother can stretch and stretch and stretch his legs. The Fourth Chinese Brother can not be burned. And the Fifth Chinese Brother can hold his breath indefinitely. It is when the First Brother is accused of a crime he did not commit, and sentenced to death, that each brother uses his unique ability to save him. Some parents may express concerns that the book's ""racial stereotypes"" were demeaning to Chinese People. Or, it contains descriptions of violent plots to execute five brothers. While the book does allude to execution, it is done in such a farcical manner, that most children will not read into it. The execution is relevant to the book's plot and helps emphasize what the tale was originally about--five brothers who love each other deeply and who use their uniqueness to help save their brother's life. This tale was my childhood favorite--and it is now my son's (7yr) favorite.",1
"I am going to type this review both as a Early Literacy Educator and as a mother of 3 young children.Robert Munsch once again reminds us that ""the love of reading"" must proceed the ""skills of reading"".  The greatest part of every school year is our  Robert Munsch author study.  Utilizing his stories for read alouds, children are automatically engaged within a text that literaly keeps them leaning forward, wanting to hear more.  The literary devices employed by this master author are vast.  An extensive use of onamatapoeia (sound words like ""crunch"" and ""bang""), repetative phrasing, climactic writing (including entertaining characters, amusing plots, problems that grow and grow before they are resolved and terrific vocabulary choice) name a few of those devices.The springboard from a Robert Munsch read aloud to creative writing is virtually seamless.  Having just been inspired by so many aspects of literature, a teacher may choose one as a ""teacing point"" for writing that day.  As he or she composes a new creative story on chart paper or overhead (or adds to his/her existing story), the students look on.  The teacher can seek to add the ""Robert Munsch teaching point"" for that day to her piece via original draft or revision.As students move to their own compositions, they often seek to experiment with these same literary devices so their ""published class work"" will show many ""Munschisms"".Children are thrilled to learn that Robert Munsch receives most of the ideas for his work from letters he receives from children.  He then dedicates the book to the child who provided the idea and names the main character for them.Each year. my students have decided to write letters to Mr. Munsch with their ideas hoping to ""star"" in a book.They also can learn tremendously from the detailed illustrations of Michael Martchenko (who illustrates most of Munsch's works).  Martchenko is a master of ""kid friendly detail"".  After your first read aloud, your children will love pouring over the books to see what hilarious details Martchenko has included.The favorite search is often for drawings of other Munsch titles within a book.  These are present in every Martchenko/Munsch book I can recall.Each of these wonderful details are present in ""Up, Up, Down!""Add an enthusiastic reader and you have a virtual theatre in your classroom!The Robert Munsch books in our collection take the most abuse.  I think the greatest compliment a children's author could receive is that his/her books are the most crumpled in the house or classroom!Your children will return time and time again to these favorites.  And, unlike MANY others, you will not tire of reading them!!As parents and teachers on budgets, we also appreciate that Robert Munsch has paperbacked his books.  He also maintans a website where children can hear Mr. Munsch read his own titles to them.Shannon Randolph... educator... mo",1

"This superhero guidebook is brought to you in first person narrative by 'Dr. Metropolis'. You're given a breakdown into the 8 power classes of superheroes (Flight, Super Strength, Psionic, Magus, Invulnerability, Super Speed, Transmutation, Energy Projecting, and Crimefighter) as established by the fictional Bureau of Meta Human Affairs. The Dr teaches you how to pose correctly, establish your headquarters, choose a costume, find a sidekick, join a league/team, and choose your archenemy with the help of quizzes and personality establishments. You also get a bonus chapter on the possibility of turning evil/villainous.This is a better detailed book than some others and filled with humorous lines throughout. The writing style in first person is quite good and I kept imagining John ""J. Peterman"" O'Hurley as the narrator's ""voice"". It adds to the book and you can imagine the sideblock helpful hints being voiced by John Ratzenberger or Kelsey Grammer. A vivid book for one with imagination. Possibly the best ""How to be a superhero"" book out there. The art could have been better though",1

"Fans that just came along and think Morning View is their 2nd cd need not read this review. Nor the fans who spout ""Drive is best song ever, incubus is new right?"" True fans of incubus will appreciate ACLOTM for the transcending message of musical art it brings forth. ""From here on it's instinctual..."" applies to this album better than anything I can say. This is a somewhat return to form for Incubus after the pop sensation that was Morning View. Don't get me wrong, Morning View is a very good album indeed, inspired by the big ass house & pretty scenery of course. But nothing like the standards set by albums like Closet Cultivation or Self titled. This new album though almost conveys a sound similar the likes of ""Purple Kool Aid"" or ""Miss Bliss"" which is simply amazing. Brandon's lyrics make this album worth the price alone, songs like ""Agoraphobia"" and ""Beware! Criminal"" are right along up there with some of the best incubus songs conceived, but what else would you expect? Lyrically we've never been let down for simple ""I'm a poet and I don't know it"" lyrics that haunt the air waves and pollute music, Brandon is himself a true poet. Sure this album isn't as crunchy as S.C.I.E.N.C.E. but if you're a real fan, you should have noticed every album is in itself different. Make Yourself has no funk or screaming whatsoever. Morning View is almost a perfect picture of solitude put into sounds (except the mosh worthy ""Under My Umbrella"") so for this album to be something along the lines of a side we've never before is just the way it should be. This album seems to experiment with Brandon's falsetto a little bit more than previous albums and Mike's guitar playing is a little more ""out there"" with his amazing guitar solos and strange robotic/fuzzy distortion. The new bass player is fitting for the band as well. ""He plays the drums!?"" which is what you'd say if you recently saw them on tour. But his funky style gives incubus back it's ""roots"" somewhat and is the perfect addition to this seemingly perfect band. Jose is modestly godlike on the drums as always and DJ Kilmore is all into funky ""robot factory"" sounds in this one which is pretty sweet aside from the space sounds of Make Your Self and S.C.I.E.N.C.E. This DvD is ""Priceless"" to say the least, just for the live performances alone, not to mention Brandon's injury (as portrayed by Jose). All in all any real fan will appreciate this work of art as whole, for it sits atop the shelf with the rest of incubus's stunning and original releases. I'm a death metal head and I can't even deny the talent incubus spews forth with every album. They aren't the poped out ""NU Metal"" or even heavy metal, too crunchy and boundless to be funk. They're just......incubus. ",0

"Danielle and Olivier Follmi have created several books that I absolutely love.  With wonderful photographs and thoughtful quotes from a variety of thinkers on every page, the Follmis reveal the beauty and genius of humanity that we sometimes lose sight of, or that so much of the media obscures.  I already owned ""OFFERINGS: Buddhist Wisdom for Every Day,"" ""WISDOM: Thoughts from Indian Masters,"" and ""ORIGINS: African Wisdom for Every Day.""  Now with ""REVELATIONS: Latin American Wisdom for Every Day,"" the Follmis once again have created an extraordinary compilation of images and ideas that I will learn from and delight in for the rest of my life.  They've also provided another gift idea for the next round of birthdays or other occasions, as I so enjoy passing these books along to others.I hope people in the media start giving these photographers the publicity they deserve.  Maybe Oprah Winfrey will consider them for her book club, or other Amazon customers will review these treasures.I don't have the words to do these books justice; but I feel like if they find their way to the classrooms, coffee tables and nightstands of more people, the world would be a more joyful, respectful and insightful place.""REVELATIONS"" has quotes from a variety of sources including Octavio Paz, Violeta Parra, Paulo Coelho, Pablo Neruda, the Popol Vuh, and various oral traditions. One of the quotes from Carlos Fuentes is ""If we do not recognize our humanity in others, we shall not recognize it in ourselves.""  That's what ""REVELATIONS"" and the Follmi's other books do so masterfully - they help us to recognize our common humanity, and to remember the holy parts of our nature.I can't imagine a greater gift we can share with each other.

"I have straight hair, but it is super-long and thick, past my waist, so I have problems combing it and keeping it smooth.  Biosilk is the best stuff I have found to detangle after washing, and keep my hair soft after it is dry.  I have tried everything else, and I mean everything, and nothing compares.  I'm so hooked I have bought it by the gallon, and believe me, that is not cheap!  It even smells great, it's not greasy, and it is fantastic for giving or receiving massages, too",0

"This gentle, closely-observed, radiant work explores new territory in the genre of writing about animals. The red-tailed hawk, Merak, never gets more than a wing in the door, literally. She is neither reared nor rehabilitated in the McQuay house. She is brought to them Ñ on their 800 acre conservation area in Ontario Ñ by the local rehabilitator to be released back into the wild. It is only almost as the door to the cage is being opened that the McQuays find out that the hawk may be human imprinted, and thus Merak may be within the circle of their lives for the rest of her own. This book, like a crafted journal, tells the story of several years of Merak's life interwoven with the lives of the people who choose to feed her (mice and rats and muskrats) and look out after her. It is always the hawk who is the focus. Merak is neither wild nor domesticated, but lives in that space where more and more nonhuman creatures will be found, as human existence encroaches upon the natural states necessary for animals to be completely themselves. McQuay is all too aware of the losses that Merak must live with, and records them with the clarity and honesty available to someone who lives amidst such hard lessons",1
"In the previous film, STAR TREK: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY (1991), we came to the final voyage of our beloved Enterprise crew that we have known for 25 years.  We would never see Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Uhara, Chekov or Sulu together again.  However, Rick Berman, Ronald D,. Moore, and Brannon Braga had one more idea!  The new Star Trek tv series, Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987-94) became such a sensation, when it ended on television in 1994, it was time for the Next Generation cast to continue their voyages on the movie screen.  The idea begins with a bottle of Dom Pergnon champagne, vintage 2265 (the year Kirk began with the Enterprise) christens the new NCC-1701-B Enterprise.  Captain Kirk (William Shatner) visits the bridge and is soon hounded by reporters.  Also guests aboard the bridge are Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Scotty (James Doohan).  Captain Harriman (Alan Ruck) gives the honors to Kirk to ""take us out"".  Soon, the Enterprise receives a distress call.  The Enterprise does not have a tractor beam installed yet.  Kirk tries to sit by and let the new young captain command, but when trouble becomes to great, the captain finally asks Kirk for suggestions.  Scotty was able to save 47 of 150 people aboard the Lakul.  Safely aboard is the leader Suran (Malcolm McDowell) and Guinan (Whoopie Goldberg).  Kirk decides to go down to Deck 15 to help the Enterprise make a blast.  They have no torpedos yet.  The Enterprise is hit.  Deck 13, 14 and 15 have been destroyed.  Scotty and Chekov finds the deck rooms and Kirk gone.  Now it is 78 years later.  The Enterprise crew contains Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart), Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Data (Brent Spiner), LaForge (Levar Burton), Worf (Michael Dorn), Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) and Troi (Marina Sirtis).  They are responding to the Amargosa Observatory.  They beam down for survivors.  Riker and Worf find Dr. Tolian Soran (wasn't he on the Enterprise where Kirk was ""killed""?).  They also find two dead Romulans.  Guinan who was also saved by the Enterprise 78 years ago, is now a bartender aboard Picard's ship.  Guinan explains to Picard that when she was rescued aboard the Enterprise B, she was in an energy ribbon that destroyed the Lakul.  The energy ribbon is also a doorway to the Nexus.  ""It is like being in joy"".  She was beamed out of it by the Enterprise B.  So was Suran who is now a very dangerous man and is holding LaForge hostage.  Later in the film, when Picard, the Enterprise crew and Saran are swept up by the energy ribbon and enter Nexus.  It is like heaven.  Picard finds another person who has just arrived in the Nexus.  It is James T. Kirk alive chopping wood for his cabin house.Star Trek: Voyager tv series began January 16, 1995. (1995-2001)The next three films are solely the Next Generation cast:  Star Trek: First Contact (1996)  Star Trek: Insurrection (1998)  Star Trek: Nemesis (2002).  Star Trek: Enterprise tv series began September 26, 2001 (2001-05).  Disc 2: Special features oncludes many featurettes, including 4 deleted sequences with the alternate ending.  James Doohan passed away July 20, 2005.  His remains were sent up in space in April 28, 2007.Update: J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof (ABC Network, LOST) will produce and direct STAR TREK XI.  Rumor has it that it will be a prequel (story before the beginning) about young James T. Kirk is in the Starfleet Academy and about Spock.  The film will be releaed Xmas 2008.Attention: Starfleet Academy:  STAR TREK  returns to television in October 2006 on KNBC channel 4 Los Angeles, Sunday night at 12:05am (Monday Morning).  The very first and original STAR TREK tv series (1966-69) will return to syndication with an update look a la Star Wars: A New Hope (1977/1997) and E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982/2002).   Michael Okuda and others with the help of CBS Digital have replaced and added new visual effects in each episode. The Enterprise now has spinning engine lights.  The Enterprise in space will now look more sharp with more detail and depth. The colors are rich. The episodes crystal clear.  The Earth will have a more accurate surface and the other ""Planets"" will have computer-generated effects as well.Some surprises too.  All 79 episodes have been digitally remastered with computer-generated effects.TV LAND does not air the restored version.",0
"These briefs are awesome.  They are so soft and comfortable to wear.  I have always worn boxers, but now after trying these on, I'll wear them all the time and to school too.

"I won't be the first or last to say this, but the Integrated Korean series is hands-down the best Korean language learning series available in English.The structure of the Beginning 1 textbook is intelligent and well thought out, particularly in combination with the workbook and the audio supplements available online for free from the University of Hawaii Press. Beginning with a thorough introduction to Hangul (Korean writing), including useful exercises in how to write it with the correct stroke order, the textbook moves at a steady pace through new vocabulary and grammar forms, making sure to reuse vocabulary and grammar from past chapters as you move forward. Occasionally certain exercises introduce supplemental vocabulary, such as a list of college majors, which is then gradually reintroduced more formally in later chapters and books.My one caveat is that you will find these textbooks difficult at times if you don't know any Korean speakers of whom you can ask questions. The books are clearly meant to be used in a classroom setting &mdash; much of the vocabulary is about schools, dormitories, etc. &mdash; and many of the exercises have one or two items, usually toward the end, that push the limits of your understanding of a new grammar form, or that require supplemental explanation from a teacher.That said, I have been able to progress steadily with these textbooks in a way that was simply beyond me with any other available series. If you're serious about learning Korean, Integrated Korean is the way to go",1

"Like a flower opening with time-release photography, Victor Chan slowly reveals the character, daily routines, spiritual honesty and generosity of His Holiness the Dali Lama as he travels in Asia and Europe for over three decades (from 1972 upon their first meeting to 2004 when the book was published). The beauty of Chan's book is a meld of de-coding of high spiritual teachings such as impermanence--often translated in the West (somewhat misleadingly) as ""emptiness""--and a sense that we are a pet mouse in Chan's breast pocket, listening to his heartbeat as it is altered by searching conversations and interviews with His Holiness.A press conference in Prauge,The Dali Lama's inner shrine in Dharamsala in India (the seat of the Tibetan government in exile), experimental subject in the West, leader of conferences dwelving into the interweaving of meditation and science, walking the Peace Line through the war zone in Ireland,surving a serious illness on the road,laughing backstage with Archbishop Desmond Tutu on Nobel Peace Laureate presentation day--these are a few of the places and roles presented in the vignettes offered up in these intimate conversations and journeys.Victor Chan is guileless and does not posture to impress. This self-acceptance witout worrying too much how he will look serves ""The Wisdom of Forgiveness"" well. We the readers can thus identify with Chan in all his humanity as he depicts the holiness of a great man shining through a human face and body. Chan's writing is lucid, filled with telling detail and description that makes the pages fly by. Unlike other reviewers here, I had no expections, and thus was merely delighted by ""The Wisdom of Forgiveness""--with  my views on important teachings such as interdepence clarified by their simple exposition and modeling on these pages.--Janet Grace Riehl, author ""Sightlines: A Poet's Diary",1

"My baby, now 8 months old, loves this book as well as ""Baby! Talk!"" and ""Grow! Babies!"" (also by same author/photographer). We first found it at our local library when she was about 4 months old, but I finally had to order it when we ran out of renewals. I love that the babies are so engaging, of different ethnicities, and show different moods. I also enjoy the straight-forward text that doesn't rhyme and won't make you feel stupid to read out loud.",1
"A very interesting coffeemaker indeed. Funky but conservative colors and a rocket-shaped design lets you know this product is unique. It is not small, however, just because it's a single serve maker does not make it small. It serves about 4-5 cups with one coffeepod and is instantly warmed up and ready to go. The only drawback is buying the pods specifically made for coffeemakers such as these and they can't be used for any other coffee maker",0
"Just when you thought you heard it all, you read something like this book.  The information it contains is really eye opening and should be read by every Senator and Congressman.  It is packed full of very useful data about the real truth regarding many commonly believed health issues that are completely wrong.  I thought so much of this book that I purchased five more copies and gave them to my relatives to read.  It is a very easy to read book and the information in it is backed up by page after page of reference material.  My wife and I have completely changed many of our habits as a result of this book and highly recommend it.",1
"What's so exciting about this expose is that Mr. Kennedy--senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, chief prosecuting attorney for Riverkeeper, and president of Waterkeeper Alliance--advocates an extreme ""free-market"" position: ""You show me a polluter and I'll show you a subsidy. I'll show you a fat cat using political clout to escape the discipline of the free market and load his production costs onto the backs of the public.""-- pg. 190Kennedy starts with a description of the cesspool of Texas, in 1999 determined to be the worst-polluting state in America. It's no accident Bush became governor. For one thing, he declared emergency tort reform, making it all but impossible for Texans to bring class action suits against polluters.Kennedy shows how corporate-privilege think tanks worked to undermine the legitimate popular sentiment for clean air and water. Bush picked Dick Cheney (or Cheney picked himself) to be running mate, to guarantee support of key oil, coal, mining, timber, chemical, pharmaceutical, and agribusiness lobbies, as well as from the Christian right.Bush-Cheney has held fast against taking action against global warming, insisting the jury is still out. There are basically no scientific skeptics anymore, and opponents of the anthropogenic, fossil-fuel greenhouse-gas theory have thinned to a small band of ""industry-funded charlatans whose voices are amplified through the bullhorn of Rush Limbaugh and the shills at the Heritage Foundation."" The administration has also dumbed down and politicized the EPA, for example, ignoring the health threats of airborne contaminants following 911, thus endangering the health of firefighters, police, construction workers, and residents. Cheney secretly convened the National Energy Policy Development Group to set the agenda for energy policy in Bushworld. The Republican-sponsored bill that proceeded from NEPD's report consisted of a cornucopia of subsidies and pollution exemptions to oil, coal, and nuclear industries. RFK, Jr. gives all the gory details.I want to conclude my review with two particularly disturbing items that Kennedy notes:1) Big Coal is the number one polluter in terms of greenhouse gases, mercury, ozone, dangerous particulates and acidrain. Particularly with the advent of mountain-top removalmining, storage of the slurry waste becomes a huge threatdownstream of the earthen dams. Thousands of people will die; Big Coal doesn't have to clean up the mess, because Big Coal spent tens of millions of dollars to elect Bush-Cheney....For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 200",1

"This is a fantastic tool to increase your knowledge of the blues.  It includes full transcription, chord progression, and a nice write up about the details of each piece.  I've never seen something presented in this way and was very pleasantly surprised with this.  I have attacked this by spending a day on each song because there is a lot to digest aside from the normal pentatonic and blues scales that are typically associated with the blues.  The best part to me was being able to hear how some great players approached the song and then being able to follow them with the backing track.  Great",1

"This is the best starting book for anyone who wants to delve into hypnosis. But it is often available as used book only and is the first in a 4-vol set. But soon (sometime in early 2006), there will be a 8-vol (yes, 8 books in a set) set in a single CD that also comes with audio and bonus video and at $75!Back about this book... It tells you experiments and findings of tests conducted on hypnotized subjects and how they react to suggestions by the ""hypnotizer"" and also what happens when they are told to do things (while in trance) that they would not do in normal consciousness.  The sections on Trance and Suggestions are excellent; perhaps the best OVERVIEW of trance and how suggestions work.Much of the material is suitable for a hypnotherapist to use in a pre-talk to trance induction",1

"""There is no more obnoxious way to punish a man than to force him to perform acts which make no sense to him, as when one empties and fills the same ditch indefinitely, when one makes soldiers who are being punished march up and down, when one forces a schoolboy to copy lines.""What will the modern man do when slapped in the face with the absurdity of his own existence?  Become an adventurer, passionate, serious, intellectual?  Where will his values come from when there are no values -- how will he create them out of nothing? Is it easier to adopt a game full of illusions created by someone else?   de Beauvoir forces the reader to come face to face with the absolute absurdity of the human condition, and then, proceeds to develop a dialectic of ambiguity that will enable the reader not to master the chaos, but to create with it.  This book will probably alter many well-rooted philosophical perceptions -- so, reader beware!  I could have done without the dramatic image of how the Nazi's conditioned themselves to become insensitive to human suffering (de Beauvoir used as an extreme example), but oh well... This book is a keeper, and very quotable! Highly recommended, especially for those diving into the Realm of Existentialism! --Katharena Eiermann, 200",1

"This book is a commentary on the Satipatthana Sutta, the Buddha's discourse on the four foundations of mindfulness.  I read the book when I started meditation practice five years ago and have reread it twice since then, finishing my most recent read a week ago.  This book explains the sutta in very clear, understandible terms making it and the practice it describes more accessible to modern western readers.  The sutta and the book describe the whole of mindfulness practice both as a meditation practice and as a way of life.  As a friend remarked, &quot;Once I found this book, I realized that I didn't need to read anything else.&quot;  If you want an introduction to mindfulness, this is the book for you.

"Being a big fan of Brooke Burke---after watching her on ""Wild On!"", buying the 2004 calendar, purchasing every FHM, Stuff or Maxim that had her on the cover...........I was happy to buy the DVD. However the DVD is just a poorly-done documentary on Brooke Burke, offering her annoying commentary over swimsuit shots done to a bad soundtrack. Like most other models, she is stuck-up, conceded, and too used to getting her own way and having no true challenges lying ahead of her. I'd take WWE's amazing Trish Stratus over Brooke anyday. Trish goes through much larger challenges than Brooke daily, in wrestling matches. Brooke wouldn't fare too well in that department. As for her looks, she is very very hot, but this DVD just brings it all down. It was truly a waste of money spent on this poor video",0

"Growing up in America, one of my favorite topics in school was history, be it American, Western, or world history.  Never in all those classes did I come across anything like the tales told in this book.  The author is a historian of Christianity, and in this book he gives an inside history of the Vatican, with an emphasis on the 20th century.  Specifically, he tells the facts that the Vatican would not like people to know.  The major events covered in this book are:1. The Vatican's treaty with Mussolini and the Fascist Party in Italy whereby the Vatican would get its own land and country from Italy.  In exchange, the Vatican would support the Fascists publicly and privately.  This occurred in 1929, I think.2. The Vatican's agreement with Hitler in the 1930s whereby the Vatican would pressure Catholics in Germany to not oppose Hitler.  In return, the Nazis gave money to the Vatican in the form of a church tax levied on German Catholics.3. The Vatican covering up for some of its officials who took part in the Holocaust.4. The Vatican helping Nazi scientists escape to the US at the end of WWII.  In return, the Allies kept secret knowledge about the Vatican's complicy in the Holocaust and private arrangements with the Axis powers.5. The Vatican aligning itself with the Mafia after WWII to help secure inroads into foreign governments, and get good deals on investments world-wide.  All in all, this was a very impressive book.  It is quite short, and probably as easy to read as a Harry Potter book, though shorter than a Potter book.  The book is written in chronological order, and there are a lot of references to various primary and secondary sources.I highly recommend this book",1
"This is an impressive read.  I came to it at just the right time in my life.  I had been reading the poems of Marianne Moore and Buckminster Fuller as well as studying Ancient Greek.  This is a dense but ultimately very rewarding book.  It incorporates passages of troubadour lyric and Greek and name-drops a lot of historical characters with which you may or may not be familiar.  For those interested in Pound and his times, I highly recommend it.  For those unsure, check out the excerpts that Amazon provides.  This is not everyone's cup of tea.  But, as I said, I came to this at the right time in my life",1

"I have to confess that I went to tears watching thIS movie, and usually I don't get emotional easily. It's so touching, a PhD professor of middle age find out that she is sick. Ovarian cancer. It was a shock for her, the doctor is talking to her and she can barely react. All through the movie, she looks at the camera from time to time and tell us all what she is thinking and suffering. There is a ""brilliant"" young doctor (yes, one of those who always wants to be the first and the best no matter what, with a big ego, the big shot of the class) who was her student in one of her literature classes. It made me very angry, his attitude, because he was treating her in a very cold and selfish way, only thinking in the results of the research. I want to say that most of the doctors and scientists are not that way. But once in a while you can find one of these.... weird specimen. The nurse was nice and treated her in a better way. This kind of movie makes us think about the fact that we are all just humans, not matter the title or knowledge you can have. And we are here to help each other, no taking advantadge of each other. I strongly recommend this movie...just be sure to have a box of facial tissues near you.",0

"Good dating books are hard to find. But in a domain that's often narrow-minded, Chediak and company have teamed up to strike a beautiful balance, uncompromisingly affirming clear biblical truths and yet leaving healthy, open-minded wiggle room for wisely selecting your path for your own unique context and particulars. This book shows that there's not only ONE WAY to do the dating thing. There are five ways - indeed, five's just the beginning - there are perhaps as many valid ways as there are single Christians looking to get married! Don't try to fit somebody else's mold or put yourself in somebody else's story. Write your own story. Blaze your own trail. Be biblically-informed and hear from five different voices, and then live in light of truth and follow the Spirit's leading. This book helps get you going. Of special note: Chediak's intro and conclusion are superb - worth the price of the book",1

If you go over it backwards you hit the first problem stated above.*The suction is not great enough to pull debris from edges and corners.In addition, the water and dry dirt end up in the same container unless you wish to clean out the container twice. The filters clog easily if you have pets. The fluid runs out quickly. The brushes are weak and ineffectual on thicker grime and spots, a hidden jelly stain or a drop of congealed juice for example. I did notice that the water method sucked up more dirt then the intended dry method. It does clean, I had dirty water as proof, but this product leaves too much behind. I was very bummed and it was a hassle to return because I live 25 miles from the store. I wish that I had accepted the negative reviews. I hope other readers will learn from me and not the hard way like I did! There really is no better way than a broom or a good cannister vaccuum to get dirt and there is a reason that the mop is still #1 after all this time! ",0
"Pempel convincingly argues in REGIME SHIFT that the major domestic and international changes taking place in Japan during the last decade or more have cumulatively resulted in a fundamental transformation in Japan's  political economy. He then traces the consequences for Japan's present and  future of this alteration. A major attempt to synthesize what others have  seen as disparate, unconnected events and trends at both domestic and  international levels into a coherent view of where Japan is and is going.

"A modified editorial team created this eighteenth edition of the classic yearly anthology. The recaps of the year's fiction and other media are still present, though a bit less inclusive than in the past. The stories that I thought were the strongest were by Gregory Maguire, Margo Lanagan, Stepan Chapman, Tanith Lee, Catherynne M. Valente, Conrad Williams and Elizabeth A. Lynn, with a particular mention for Laird Barron's creepy, poetic western ""Bulldozer"". The mix of new and established writers, visible in that list, adds interest. As in the past, the stories tend toward urban/modern-day settings, but a few do represent the historical and otherworld facets of the genre.If any story in the anthology is controversial, it'll be the Chuck Palahniuk. I didn't like it -- I thought it read sort of like a grade schooler's gross-out combined with a careful reading of the Anatomy and Physiology Coloring Book -- but on the other hand, it does take something really gross to gross me out these days. And gross me out it did. Recommended for strong stomachs (heh) only.On page 466 my story ""The Elf Knight and Lady Isabelle"" from the anthology CLOAKED IN SHADOW got an honorable mention. ",1

"Jane Austen's story of love and misunderstanding in late 18th century England is perhaps best known for its opening sentence: ""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.""  The Bennett family has five daughters and, since the estate will pass to a cousin on their father's death, the girls must make good marriages if their futures are to be secure.  When the wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennett is determined that Jane, her eldest daughter, will win his heart.  All seems to be progressing according to plan until Bingley's snobbish friend, Mr. Darcy, whisks him away from Netherfield, leaving Jane devastated and her sister Lizzie sure the cause is Darcy.  When Darcy then proposes to Lizzie, she is astonished and roundly denounces him for the pain he caused her family.Originally published in early 1813, Pride and Prejudice became a literary success before the end of the year.  This new edition has been annotated and edited by David M. Shapard, a specialist in European history of the 18th Century.  The Annotated Pride and Prejudice follows faithfully the text of the first edition (1813), which was checked by Jane Austen.  The only changes made to the text were to make spelling or capitalization of proper names consistent.The text is presented on the left page and annotations are presented on the right page.  Annotations are provided on a wide range of topics: literary interpretations, word meanings, explanations of items such as a ""chaise and four"" which in some cases include illustrations, and explanations of historical context.  While this classic can be enjoyed without the extras, understanding the small distinctions between a phaeton, gig, carriage and ""chaise and four"" can help demystify social interaction in 18th Century society.Devotees of Austen's work will find that The Annotated Pride and Prejudice provides a fresh illumination to a favorite work.  Those reading it for the first time will find the annotations, maps and timelines helpful in understanding this exceptional novel. Armchair Interviews says:  Whether for the first or hundredth time, this is always a great red",1

"The book Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White to me is blatant and apparent proof that the Asian political voice has been hijacked and is fully rampant with an anti-white, anti-American viewpoint.  While I do not think the mind of Mr. Wu is reflective of the vast majority of Asians in America, his scripture is about as proof-positive as I have seen that while white Americans (European Americans) have fought hard against segregation for decades under a naïve spell for the benefit of minorities, Asian politicians as well as university professors of various minority races are actually promoting the philosophy and indoctrination for racial separatism.  The idea of racial equality is apparently not what elites like Frank Wu have in mind:  the condemnation of America and the same people who created pro-Asian immigration laws from the middle 1960s - whites -- is.  Far beyond equal rights for all, this new anti-anything-for-the-sake-of-it viewpoint, which airs in Yellow is nothing like what Martin Luther King, Jr., and the many other former civil rights activists were promoting.  The mindset of the author in this book (Frank Wu) is hyper-eccentric, seemingly hateful, dangerously irrational, and anti-establishment with no clear objective other than dissent for destruction.  To learn about the new form of hatred that a growing radical Asian intellectual base and other minorities are brewing, browse this book",1
"Dan Slott is a rising star in the comics world.  If you grew up reading mainstream comics in the 70s or 80s, you have to love everything this guy does.  Not only does Slott like to use 70s and 80s comic stalwarts like She-Hulk and Ben Grimm in his stories, he also writes comics as if the grim and gritty late 80s and 90s had never happened.

"Or write.Or, for that matter, think critically on the key issues of the day---wealth creation, unemployment, the war against folks who want to commandeer 747s and crash them into skyscrapers. It is a Serious time, an age of great peril for our country, for our democracy, and for liberty in the world. It is a time for Serious men, with Serious ideas.Sadly, Moore is not one of them. Now: Michael Moore presents himself as the Angry Wild Man of the Left: brave, ferocious, caustic, intellectually independent, bound and beholden to no one---asking the questions that need to be asked, dammit, and the Devil take the hindmost! What this self-anointed Crusader of the Common Man has produced is another story entirely: a kind of Populist Leftism for Dummies, written in crayon and featuring giganto-font type with SUPER-SIZED margins (evidently for the remedial reader, who would be content with pictures)---which ain't the only thing Super-Sized about this penny-dreadful. And dreadful it is. Moore's unfunny screen amounts to this: Bush is evil, capitalism is evil, the System is evil, it's all a bunch of nasty white men in suits who plot to send low-income young Americans to death and dismemberment in the sands of Iraq while Bush and Bin Laden hob-nob it over caviar back at the ranch in Crawford. And that's about it: which is saying a lot, really all you can fit in a ""book"" half eaten up by blank space and margins. The truth is, everyone knows a Michael Moore: he's the cabdriver from Hell, who picks you up at Newark and launches into a 20-minute harangue---with you, the helpless captive audience, sealed off behind dirty plexi-glass, trapped like a crazed weasel in a steel coffin hurtling along the New Jersey Turnpike at 90 miles an hour---a frothy, spittle-spewing sermon about how filthy New York is, how corrupt the politicians are, how things would be different if somebody took the ""Man"" down. He's the slobby sales guy who gets in two hours late every day, and leaves well before 4:00---and who holds court at the water cooler, letting you know how many deals he would be locking down if only Management---you know, dude, the ""Man""---would get its sh*t together. He's like a shabbier, slightly psychotic, downscale version of Uncle Buck, who pops in for the holiday unexpected and clogs up the toilet. So if ""Dude"" is meant as humor, it falls flat: the writing is stale, shrill, and strident, the sort of thing the mean local drunk spits out after a wild Night Train bender. Nah, this isn't humor: it's pure political invective, meant to elicit a ""Preach it, Brother!"" from its target audience.But it's a little tough for Joe Six-Pack---Moore's intended reader, evidently---struggling to pay off his cable bills, fretting about the wife having to work graveyards, wondering how he's going to afford medical care---to yell ""Preach it, Brother Moore!"" from the sidelines, even as Brother Moore is preaching it from the back of a stretch limousine. Or a super-duper-stretch, in Moore's case.And frankly, that's not even the saddest part of this walking affront to decency: I am certain that beneath all the calculated bluster and outrage, Moore doesn't believe a word he writes. Moore spouts rebellion, civil unrest, rage against the Machine: he talks a good game. But let's face it: the only street-theater he sits up late at night planning are midnight raids against the local, hapless In-and-Out Burger. Like PT Barnum, Moore is relentless, tireless self-promoter: he's hungry---he needs to feed!---and like the fat dorky kid in the back row in that political science class, he'll say anything to get attention.The worst of it is really this: Ideas---however incoherent---have Consequences. Moore's greatest crime with ""Dude, Where's my Country?"" isn't his banality, nor even his delight at reducing the most complex social problems to lowest common denominator insults---nor even his lack of seriousness. It's that Moore is deeply disingenuous. Take his contention, written with utmost condescension, that his readers will never be rich. No chance. No way, not in America! That's not just wrong: it's deeply dangerous. If anything, Moore himself is proof of the American dream: a scruffy, uneducated, possibly unhinged refrigerator of a man, who went out into the jungles of corporate america with some cheap movie equipment and made some snarkily funny documentaries. Who plugged into the Zeitgeist of the age, who made one barbaric yawp after another, and got attention. And made millions. Now: the real conclusion from ""Dude"" should be---if Michael Moore can do it, my God---so can I!Instead, we get whiney finger-pointing: it's the Man's fault you're living hard, eating catfood, and begging for spare change. It's not *you*, not your responsibility: the System did it, Dude. Sartre once summed up his philosophy of existentialism by saying that Man should live so as not to contribute to the suffering. Moore takes the opposite tack: he's like Samara, the creepy-crawly little dead girl from the well in Ring: he never sleeps, he never stops, he'll never stop eating, and as a result---at least, without a damned good editor---he'll never stop spewing. So is it too much to hope for that Moore, who can be a prodigiously talented, incandescently cynical filmmaker, when he wants to be---is it too much to ask that he will one day put his abilities to good use, really lay down a wicked little polemic that sets out a true battle plan for change? Fat chance.JS",1
"If I was getting a gift for TCM host and film historian Robert Osborne, and I knew he didn't already have this DVD set I would (a) be very surprised and (b) buy it for him. This DVD set is for film buffs who aren't satisfied with the essentials that everyone knows about - ""Birth of a Nation"", ""The Jazz Singer"", ""Frankenstein"", etc., which are great films, but don't tell the whole story of early cinema. The set was organized by Bruce Posner and runs to some nineteen hours, and is an astonishing achievement. The set consists of seven discs each of which explore a different aspect of early cinema. Among the films included are Douglass Crockwell's ""Simple Destiny Abstractions"", plus some animations with some very good detail on the level of Windsor McCay. The 1928 version of ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" focuses more on displaying some complex optical work than the story, reducing Poe's tale to only ten minutes in length. ""Night on Bald Mountain"" is an example of pinboard animation, in which a film is made completely using shadows from a pin screen. This technique continued to be used for decades. Suspense - a 1913 melodrama in which a housewife and her baby are nearly attacked by a knife-wielding drifter - is included because of its split-screen techniques. However, it is also interesting as the beginnings of what became the psycho-thrillers that exist to this day.For the budget conscious, the disc entitled ""PICTURING A METROPOLIS, New York City Unveiled"" is the only disc available for individual purchase. This particular disc is great for history buffs as well as film buffs for all of its views of New York City life during the period from 1890-1940. The New York City disc moves from early footage of the city, including the Edison Company's famous and poetic Coney Island at Night, to Charles Sheeler and Paul Strand's well-known Manhattan, to some work by Rudy Burckhardt, the film-maker, photographer, and painter who was also one of de Kooning's earliest friends in New York.There are also some films financed by the depression-era WPA. Among them, Elia Kazan makes an appearance in a rather odd socialist movie about the poor of New York. There are some pictures sponsored by Labor Unions that offer 'alternative newsreels' that expose illegal business thuggery and a reactionary murder cult known as The Black Legion. Entertainment figures that are later blacklisted for their political beliefs and actions also make an appearance here - most notably, Paul Robeson, an actor often forgotten because of this. Robeson can be seen narrating a film on organized labor in this collection.The disc entitled ""The Beginnings of Ciné-Dance"" has quite a bit of variety, but is still clearly delimited, opening with Annabelle Moore's ""Butterfly Dance"" and offering near its end David Bradley's Peer Gynt of 1941, starring a teenage Charlton Heston.Some of the best material on the set is from Hollywood, probably due to the larger budgets involved. Included in this category would be some of the original montages of Slavko Vorkapich that were done for some MGM movies. This includes a bit of film in which the entire Napoleanic war appears to play out in just two minutes. Also included is Vorkapich's opening montage to ""Crime Without Passion"" in which three banshees fly about and terrorize the streets of Manhattan. The Ernst Lubitsch ""touch"" also apparently includes montages, and there is an excerpt from 1926's ""So This is Paris"" that shows a flapper dance in montage. It does a good job of conveying the wildness of the place at that time, which is part of the central theme of the movie. Also included are Busby Berkeley's numbers ""Lullaby of Broadway"" and ""By a Waterfall"", which are light compared to the other pieces with their more hidden deeper meanings. I could go on forever describing the contents of this DVD set, but these were the pieces that stood out the most to me, anyway. The label of ""Avant Garde"" does not really fit this collection as we know the meaning of the term today. After all, there is work here by the Edison Company, D.W. Griffith, and a host of other people who have secure places in mainstream motion picture history. The ""Avant Garde"" label is more of an indication that film as an artform during the time period covered was inherently avant-garde just because it was new. The quality of the video is quite good considering the probable shape of the originals. I personally love this set and think it is well worth the price",0

"Black and white, 1937, French with English subtitles, and some people will stop reading right now. For the rest of you, let's look at the cover blurb. ""One of the very first prison escape movies, GRAND ILLUSION is hailed as one of the greatest films ever made. Jean Renoir's masterpiece stars Jean Gobin and Pierre Fresnay as French soldiers held in a World War I German prison camp, and Erich von Stroheim as the unforgettable Captain von Rauffenstein."" Oh, he wasn't the only unforgettable character. Most of them were. It's a genuine pleasure to see an ""ensemble cast"" where everybody shines, everybody's outstanding, and everything just works. Excellent writing, directing, acting. I'm sure the HOGAN'S HEROES bunch watched this, because it's funnier than they were. But it's also deadly serious. It alternates, as life in a prison camp quite probably would, and every bit of it is a joy to watch. Also, since it was filmed before World War II, watching such an accurate portrayal of pre-Nazi German soldiers was a bit spooky. Prescient. In short, just a wonderful film. ",0

"AN ANIMATED FAMILY OF X-MEN -- COMPLETE WITH SPANDEX & IT ALL TURNS OUT PRETTY - - WELL - - INCREDIBLE: Pixar and Disney have made six exceptional films together, but I find myself reaching for this one almost every time. Needless to say, superhero films are no longer novelties, yet this film seems to have new angles on seemingly cliched themes. The lawsuits that put the ""Supers"" out of business is certainly a real gem and it gives Brad Bird who wrote and directed ""The Incredibles"" some unexplored avenues to try, which he does and it turned out, well - - PRETTY INCREDIBLE! WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: First we have the husband and wife superhero team that never has a chance to team up as ""Supers"" and instead turns into Mr. & Mrs. Average American after the lawsuits that ended the ""Supers"" crime fighting dynasty. Along the way they had three very different yet ""Super"" offspring! Wow, that's enough right there to keep us busy. We also have sub-plots which include each one of the 3 children's coming of age in a ""Super"" way, but as ordinary kids. The kids, like their parents, struggle all the way through the film to get to where they go and they grow in the process individually and as a family. We have Bob Parr [Mr. Incredible] going through what appears to be a mid-life crisis, and his confused wife, Helen, who just wants them all to fit in like everybody else. But, after all, how can ""Elastigirl"" be just another soccer mom? We have the return of a hostile and dysfunctional former fan [Buddy] who turns ""The Incredibles"" lives upside-down and inside-out. For the first time, the ""Supers"" are the underdogs! EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS - SATISFYING FAMILY ISSUES & MUCH MORE: After these elements are set into motion, we have EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS, and it is fascinating to see all the Incredibles' family issues worked out like any other family's, but with many interesting twists. ""The Incredibles"" is a SUPER film! DVD FEATURES: Anamorphic Widescreen 2.39:1 [very widescreen] Digital to Digital Transfer is the sharpest I have seen yet! Lots of features and deleted scenes as well as some early concepts for different ways of introducing the characters make me grateful they made it the way they did. The ""Jack-Jack Attack"" is probably the high point of the features and illustrates what we did not see going on between ""Jack-Jack"" and the baby-sitter. I just wish it was longer. The behind the scenes ""Featurettes"" are worth watching as are the blooper scenes, though they seem a bit contrived. There are two commentary tracks, one with Brad Bird [writer/director] and John Walker [producer]. and another with the animators. I could not watch the entire movie with either track on. Maybe you can. The files about the ""Supers"" are interesting. There is lots more. If you like to go in for it, you can spend the day with the features alone. For me, however, there is the film. This is the best animated film, in my opinion, and is perfect for all members of the family (of all ages) to connect with in a fun-filled, family sort of way. ",0

"This novel is a pleasure on all levels-extremely well written and hilarious. The characters are both ludicrous (as people are) and believable at the same time. Mr. Ames is successful in capturing the unique essence of each of his (wide array of) odd characters.  I was impressed by the overall product, but chose to write the review because this book was so FUNNY.  The main character's neurosis, aggravated by an alcohol problem, is tempered by his optimism and desire to be liked; his nervous interactions with others and his histrionic reactions to the world around him will make you squeal. The author so captures the mindset of this well-intentioned alcoholic that his observations might well be of use to the medical profession. Something honest about all of us is distinctively revealed in these pages and Mr. Ames' style makes every moment worthwhile",1
"What better experience for an avid reader than a mystery set among rare books and book collectors? In this, the first and by far the best of his published novels, case-hardened detective Cliff Janeway turns out to be not only a book lover, but a budding book merchant. Never mind how improbable the combination, Janeway is charismatic as all getout and the story grabbed me almost from the first lines. With a cache of mint condition Milagro Beanfield War first editions tucked away, and a yen for a change in occupation, our detective hero has a special interest in the latest homicide. He runs an occasionally open rare bookstore on the side, and the victim is one of his book scouts. Right up front we get some wonderful detail on the somewhat shady business of book scouting, and it doesn't hurt at all that when the plot `thickens' it involves dealers and others who play roles in the business, because that means there's lots more good stuff to come.In addition to a first class mystery, Booked to Die is chock full of information on books and book collectors. This novel, like the rarest of first editions, is the kind of find that in the end makes you smile and know it's all been worth the trouble.If you're ready to buy, there's a signed first on offer over at ABE for $2,450.

"This two-pack is an amazing pairing of like-minded high school comedies that are also suitable contrasts in that ""Fast Times..."" was generally a contemporary ""classic"" defining of its time (the frosted-blonde locks and Vans sneakers found their way IMMEDIATELY even to my burg of an Atlanta suburb high school in Lilburn, GA and fostered a class of Spickoli wanna-bes), whereas ""Dazed..."" was essentially a nostalgia piece, a throwback film designed to recall another time entirely.Both films do as fine a job of depicting the reality of high school life as being equally dismal and comic, categorizing the cliques that were more specifically targeted in the John Hughes films of the 1980's as being less than specific sub-groups than being variations of the same theme; we're all somewhere between childhood and adulthood, and we're all equally screwed.Both films are also similar in that they highlight the performances of actors who would eventually become well-established within the industry (even going so far as to win an Academy Award in Sean Penn's case) in the early stages of their careers; Sean Penn and Jenifer Jason Leigh in ""Fast Times..."" and Ben Affleck and Matthew McConaughey in ""Dazed..."", to say nothing of the actors in smaller roles (Nicolas Cage and Anthony Edwards in ""Fast Times..."" and Parker Posey Milla Jovovich in ""Dazed..."", just to name a few).As a suburbanite old enough to remember both eras covered in these two films (I could've been anyone's little brother in ""Dazed..."" and could've passed for Mark Rattner in ""Fast Times...""), I can heartily vouch for the authenticity of both movies as well as the competance with which both screenplays were written.  The performances of all the actors as well as terrific soundtrack scoring in both films make this two-pack a no-brainer; both films are absolutely worth their price and should find themselves in the collection of anyone who thinks that the ""American Pie"" series is the perfect representation of young adult life in America.  Both of these movies showed it first and portrayed it better",0

"Confidence, as argued by Rosabeth Kanter, is not a state, it is a trajectory. Whether you look at a sports team, a business, a nation, or an individual, they are all subject to the cyclic nature of decline and improvement. 'Losers' find it harder to attract talent, start new projects, or even keep up the daily operations; 'winners' have the advantage of the halo effect which hides weaknesses, attracts talent, and fuels further growth. The author analyzes these self-fulfilling prophecies (Pygmalion effect) and what it takes to reverse them through the cornerstones of confidence (as identified by R. Kanter) - accountability, collaboration, and initiative. Leading a turnaround (or even admitting to requiring one) can be daunting and a complex task and to help us Rosabeth Kanter identifies framework to reverse the cycle (through examples of Seagate, Continental Airlines, BBC, and more):1. Invest into people and their work environment. Show confidence in the future, set attainable goals and start winning one step at a time. 2. Promote collaboration and free flow of information and decision making. (Winning teams are data rich)3. As first two improve the ethos of the group/individual, risk taking (innovation) potential is released which further helps build successful products and fuel cycles of growth.(This is by no means a complete list, only a small sample)Overall, ""Confidence"" is a great book and an excellent resource for improving your business and personal life. Not surprisingly, winning is hard work and this book does not provide any misconceptions in that regard. But the ability to identify the cycles of growth and decline can in itself be a priceless piece of information which can help stop the declines early and allocate resources and rewards when they are du",1
"Very rarely does a film improve upon the book on which it is based. It takes a visual master, working with an excellent screenwriter, to convey as much detail about a story as an author. However, Akira Kurosawa's High and Low manages to do it. The source novel, Ed McBain's 87th Precinct novel King's Ransom is a well written thriller that, nonetheless, doesn't really stay with the reader afterwards. Kurosawa, however, better known for his samurai epics, took McBain's story and gave it a depth never realized in the book. The famed director stays faithful to the novel, but fleshes out a simple detective story into a drama that makes social commentary as well as entertains.McBain's Douglas King never really earns the reader's sympathy -- even though we can understand his motives. Toshiro Mifune's Kingo Gondo, in contrast, becomes a three-dimensional sympathetic character. Both men have their entire financial well-being at stake in the form of a hostile takeover bid for control of a shoe company. Both men, at first, behave selfishly, refusing to pay the ransom even though they are risking their chauffeur's son's life. However, McBain's Douglas King never shows the humanity that Mifune's Gondo does. Kurosawa adds a scene, not in the book, where Gondo pays the ransom and saves the kidnapped child. Even though his business deal is now dead and he is broke, he still reacts with relief and joy when the kidnappers return the chauffeur's son. It's an emotional payoff that McBain's book is sorely lacking and helps to flesh out the character.Gondo is also a more sympathetic character partially due to the fact that his actions are at least partially dictated by Japan's rigid caste system. Japanese society is broken up into social strata whereby the rich and powerful expect the lower classes to know their place. This division of influence, unlike in the United States, is generally accepted, even by those on the lower end of the scale. This isn't just the way Mifune's Gondo thinks -- EVERYONE thinks that way in Japan. However, Kurosawa, while he understands the mindset of Japanese society, is also critical of it. Kurosawa shows that when Gondo pays the ransom and saves the boy, even at the cost of his financial well-being, the Japanese people, as a whole, hail Gondo as a hero. Our sympathies are clearly supposed to be with the chauffeur and his son, even though it goes against every principle of the Japanese caste system. This commentary gives High and Low a depth that McBain's novel lacked.In the novel, McBain hedges his bets morally. One of the kidnappers is a vile hardened criminal. However, the other two kidnappers, a husband and wife, are more sympathetic, particularly the wife who doesn't know about the plan until it is already in effect. In the end, the kidnappers get away and the chauffeur's son, Bobby, refuses to aid police in their capture. In addition, the police are seen as somewhat disjointed with some detectives with personalities and egos that irritate other policemen.Kurosawa, in contrast, concentrates on one central kidnapper, a vile person who exploits drug addicts to do his dirty work and then kills them when he gets what he wants. McBain's subplot about the husband and wife is distracting, even though his kidnappers, with their self-doubt and streaks of conscience, seem to be a more balanced and realistic portrayal. In addition, the police are seen as a cohesive unit who forgo ego in order to catch the kidnapper. However, this is more a reflection of Japanese society, with its emphasis on team effort rather than individual glory, than a pie-in-the-sky idealized vision of the police. McBain's portrayal of the police is probably close to what an American police squad is like. Still, Kurosawa's vision is more satisfying. The police pursue the criminal and bring him to justice. Ironically, the resolution of the film, made in Japan, is probably much more satisfying to Americans than the resolution of the book, written by an American.King's Ransom has an interesting plot. But author Ed McBain has only provided a good skeleton of a story. Akira Kurosawa, in contrast, has taken the exciting, but conventional story and turned it into a memorable cinematic masterpiece",0

"""Symbiotic Planet"" may sound to the average reader like just another attempt to ""classify"" life on our little Earth. This would be an error. This book, as is typical of Dr. Margulis' writing is precise, complete, and allows the reader to easily follow along this amazing journey through time and life itself. I have read, as well as reviewed a number of Dr. Margulis' books through the years, and stand in awe at how she can ""break down"" what to myself seems an incredibly complicated idea, into plain common examples. Her writing captivates the mind of the reader, to the point that it seems impossible to put down. I am a very slow reader-yet I finished the book (the first time) in a single day. One cannot stop reading it is just that fascinating!  There is little I can say that would be nearly adequate to properly describe this book. The reader will decide for themselves that is really is a great read and a great book to keep as reference. It really is as simple as that",1
"Every autumn and throughout the winter, I play this CD allowing each note of the songs to harmonize with the changing of the autumn leaves, from yellow to orange, to red.  The beauty of the Windham Hill artists interpretations of Faure, Debussy, and Satie just come alive.  Their notes seem so light, clear, and crisp like that first day of cool winter air.  They pick up so much of natures's beauty to the familiar composed pieces.  The overall arrangement of the pieces flow well and smoothly until you had realized that it's time to push the start button again.  This is a beautiful work and is highly recommended",0
"Old Friends is a lush, beautifully arranged CD with an enticing selection of songs of Irish and Scottish origin.  From the first notes of the haunting Banks and Braes of Bonnie Doon until the last note of The Parting Glass, you will be captivated by John's clear, golden tenor and by the great musicians he has surrounding him.  This CD takes you through many emotions.  The modern day horror of Chernobyl is showcased in Farewell to Pripchat.  The dedication of Margaret as she cares for her husband who is lost in the world of Alzheimer's disease in the so touching The Dutchman, will strike a chord for anyone who has had a firsthand knowledge of that terrible disease.  The love of Margaret is a triumph over it and this version brings that love to the forefront.  Dark Lock Nagar is an absolutely marvelous song.  John's voice on this song hits the heights and makes you shiver and smile in amazement.  It is GLORIOUS!  As John himself is wont to say, this CD is a roller coaster ride of emotions.  It has stories brought to life by the voice with the heart that is always there.  Here is John's first version of The Old Man.  It is lovely and it is most interesting to put it against the version that John now sings in both concert and on other CDs.  This was recorded prior to the death of John's beloved father.  It is a touching song with an edge of saddness for words not spoken.  It's a sweeter version than the newer ones that have so much more of John's own personal pain in them.  The loss of his dad is a part of him that will forever be there in every performance.  Mother Machree has a lilting quality that gives thanks to mothers everywhere.  This CD has poignant moments of historic loss as in The Skye Boat Song and Massacre at Glen Coe.  John's Scots-Irish heritage is always in his music.  ENJOY THAT HERITAGE!  This array of songs is a personal favorite that has been played many times over in the years since I first was able to get my hands on it.  So nice that now a John McDermott CD does not involve a hunt through little specialty shops in out of the way places.  Take advantage of their availability and take the journey with John, Brigham, Bill, Ray, Eamonn and all his musicians and you will get a time well  spent visiting places of history and bravery.  Listen to a voice that is unique with perfect diction and a love that is apparent for every song he chooses to sing.  Old Friends is, indeed, an old friend",0

"This is perhaps an interesting glimpse into the life of the wealthy and privileged, who live among the huge plantations on the Sri Lankan plains (formally known as the country ""Ceylon"" prior to 1972). Liz's character struggles to find her place in the home & in the life of the man she thinks she loves. The cinematography is wonderful and the costumes are brilliant. I have yet to see a vehicle that starred Elizabeth Taylor that wasn't intriguing enough to hold my attention. Any fan of Liz will be more than pleased to own this for their very own collection. Happy day at last!. The studio has now decided to release this on DVD! Peculiar thing tho.... this particular movie seems to be left out of any lists of film credits that Liz has done. Example: ""Suddenly last summer"", ""Who's afraid of Virginia Wolf"", ""Cleopatra"", ""The Taming of the Shrew"", ""The last time I saw Paris"", ""A place in the Sun"", ""Giant"". All of these movies on DVD format do not list under the talent files section ""Elephant Walk""  as an addition to her body of work. It's as if there was a conscience decision to have omitted the movie altogether. Perhaps the real reason (so I've read somewhere) is that Liz was not pleased with the movie/performance and chooses not to recognize it.  Whatever the case may be,  this is truly a fine film, worthy enough to be included on any list regardless of who doesn't want you to know",0
"I just purchased this teakettle today and my review is based on one day of use.  DesignFirst off, it looks very nice and feels well built.  As advertised, the finish is mirror clear.  Designed for hanging, the handle feels very sturdy and looks to be well attached. The nose piece seems to be a slightly lighter weight stainless steel with a lightweight metal ball at the end.  Attached with a screw, the ball may have a tendency to come loose over time.   UseWith a quart of water, the kettle boils well with a nice whistling sound.  At a boil, the handle is warm but not uncomforable to the touch.  The ball and nose piece are warm when removed but not hot and I experienced no issues with excessive steam once the unit was removed from the burner.  Pouring is easy and the handle offers a range of positions from which to hold the pot.  The only areas of the handle that are hot are the rods attaching the handle to the pot and they are unlikely to cause a burn if touched.  RecommendationThis is a nice stylish kettle and will probably hold up well over time.  I can only imagine other owners have filled the pot to capacity when the handle has become hot and that may also affect the pouring.  As far as cleaning the pot I can not understand who needs to scrub the inside of the pot unless they are making soup directly in the pot",0
"Whenever I have guests over the house, I always put this CD on.  It provides great background music, as these cats are always mellow.

Throw away all your Ray Coniff, Montovani, and -- dare I say it? -- never listen to Peter Townsend again.  This is the guitarist for you.  You won't regret it",0

Radical Chic is timeless and as relevant today as when Wolfe put his politically incorrect observations down in writing. Wolfe is like a mirror of inescapable truth to those blinded by their sense of personal wisdom and charity. Mau-Mauing the Flack Catchers captures the tidal pond where government and neighborhood activists interact. Wolfe has the eye of a reporter mixed with the sense of story to chronicle events in a way that needs little narration.  Both should be required reading in every school of journalism and  by every public official in the land. ,1
"""Thomas takes us beyond Freud, beyond Eros and Thanatos, and thus challenges the very substance of the Freudian text. Within the analyses and, he suggests, buried within her individual neurosis, is the subtext of history--the Final Solution. And beyond the horror is the transcendent vision of salvation through love in the mythical state of Israel. In this bold, intellectually challenging novel, Thomas goes beyond both history and historical fiction: he explores the shadowy realm of perception and perceiver with breathtaking vision and artistry."" Reviewed by Daniel Weiss, Virginia Quarterly Review 'The White Hotel' is an extraordinary book. It was given the highest recommendation by my best friend, and it is a read I will never forget.  It is taken from the case history of Lisa Erdman, an early patient of Sigmund Freud; the book explores her case of sexual hysteria and finds the way to self destructiveness. The scenes with Lisa and Dr.Freud are fascinating. They take her back into childhood and into her dreams. Lisa's erotic dreams are almost visions. They are premonitions to Lisa of death and destruction. Freud helps Lisa to resume her normal life as an opera singer, and we are brought into the world of opera as Lisa finds it.  She remarries and settles in the Ukraine with her husband and step-son, and then the unraveling begins. Their harrowing adventures will leave you on the edge. As life as Lisa knows it begins to crumble, so do we.""Lisa's story is told three times. Once, as a long letter of erotic ramblings by a psychotic, once in image steeped poetry, and finally, as narrative prose, in the dry tone of a doctor discussing a case, complete with musings and asides. By the end of the third rendition, the reader begins to understand something the eminent psychologist never will. That Anna is not only a product of, but a metaphor for the collective fall of European consciousness into madness that still scars the entire century.""T.Rex'The White Hotel' is much like a mystery, and we are part of the unraveling.  I was filled with melancholy and a dream like stance while reading this book. I have not read a book that is so well written. and at the same time lays groundwork of the extraordinary. A trip for Lisa becomes a trip that we will not soon forget.  Highly Recommended.  prisrob 2-18-07",1
"A quick, enjoyable, yet deep read.  Ms. Dunn can really move a story forward and manages to tackle some deep internal issues through her protagonist.  Anyone who grew up Evangelical and is left feeling somewhat weird after that experience will find a kindred spirit here, and those who did not will gain some insights in a very enjoyable way.  I laughed out loud, cringed inwardly, shook my head, felt triumphantly understood, and even cried at times.

"An important contribution to the environmental debate.  I was suprised by the critical review below that gives 1 star to Plan B and cites &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; by Bjorn Lomborg as a refutation of Brown's work.  Readers of that review may not be aware that &quot;Skeptical&quot; has been discredited, refuted and rejected by the scientific community.  Critical reviews of Lomborg's book can be found in leading science journals, including Nature, Scientific American and Science.  The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty issued a decision that declared Lomborg's research &quot;to fall within the concept of scientific dishonesty,&quot; and to be &quot;clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice.&quot; (Lomborg is Danish). Readers will not be persuaded by references to junk science coming from an anti-environmentalist",1
  This is the first review I have taken the time to write on Amazon.  This toy is as bad as others have said.  So much is wrong with the design - but the worst thing is that the reflective panels do not stay in place- I wanted to think that they MUST lock in place somehow.  Has Rainbow Art tested this product?  I was hoping to read some Amazon reviews of Digidraw to find out if anyone had a remedy for the panels slipping- The remedy is to return the toy.  I will quickly say that the reflected image is a blurry shadow - my boy's can do better freehand.  Please don't waste your money!,0
"The spider's house, has a very appealing cover, with a equally appealing story. This book surpasses all expectations, and beyond. A historical over view is always illuminating in the backdrop of every conversation, told as if the characters were them selves speaking to the reader or even thinking out loud  without any inhibitions. It's first hand knowledge of the culture, that one can only gain from years of encounters. Paul Bowels, speaks of the Moroccan people as they truly are, the good, the bad, the awful, and their quest for a modern futures, that is to bare many flaws. The French influence, and there cruelty is also vividly detailed, and the reader is left wondering why such history is well forgotten by the new generation. Paul Bowles is not only forgiving but also critical in his judgments regarding the Moroccan people's limited perception of the other.In all, this book covers the perspective view of every person who is encountered in this book, by that I really mean everyone.

When I received it there was a permanent green pixel right in the middle of the display, and a 3/8"" light banding strip at the top.  Amazon was VERY helpful with the return process, even covering the return shipping.  It seems that bad pixels in new monitors can be considered 'normal', but right in the center is unacceptable.  I have seen this monitor in operation, and as long as there are no pixel problems, it looks great",0
"OK, I don't know what these other reviewers are listening to, but this is the most stale, unemotional music I've heard out of TD up to that point. I prefer Cyclone over this album anyday. My copy says that it's &quot;live&quot; but no mention is made of the venue. Maybe it's a type-o or it's &quot;live-in'studio&quot;. But it's very plastic-sounding and repetitive. Let me go back in time: The album came out around 1980. At that time there was the beginning of the digital revolution and synths were becoming more complex, with new synthetic instruments being produced and gaining popularity. TD was always in the forefront, using the latest and greatest gear. One problem at the time was that many of these synths lacked what is called &quot;velocity sensitivity&quot;. That's the effect you get when you play a piano hard or soft, you get two very diffenrent sounds, plus all the variations possible in between. These new synths lacked that ability for another year or two. The sequencing equipment, though more complex, also lacked the ability to record velocity info, so everything comes out at the same volume. Now this effect was perfect for the new synth-pop and New Wave music that eventually led to that dark and emotionless period in music history known as &quot;the 80's&quot;. So therefore you get TD playing synths with lots of tonal possibilities but very little expressiveness. The same problem is in evidence on Jean-Michele Jarre's Magnetic Fields album. No soul. Now the music itself is rather lackluster, even poppy in parts, and downright embarrassing in other parts. I could see Edgar Froese taking over after Pete Baumann left, and getting caught up in the possibilities of the new synth technology. It resulted in this case in an album that sounds VERY dated, unlike much other TD music. I suppose this music would have it's fans but someone who appreciates TD's adventurous nature will not help but be surprised that TD could put out such bland stuff. Then again what followed for twenty years was pretty much in the same vein or worse, though I'm still looking for the exceptions. Buy at your own risk",0
"As a general practitioner who uses this book to answer fairly routine questions about care and treatment of children, I recommend it highly. It is easy to read and well organized. It openly acknowledges areas of  ambiguity or controversy in the field and gives what appears to be a  balanced view of the issues. I feel very comfortable relying on this text  for most of my pedodontic questions",1
"Imagine a time when there was basically no federal government.  When whatever trouble people got into, they just slugged their way out of it while the whole country watched.  That's the scenario for ""Bread and Roses.""  The famous phrase comes from the 1912 textile strike in the mill city of Lawrence, Massachusetts but thanks to the noble efforts of strikers and labor leaders there, it now stands for solidarity, for compassion, for justice for the working class.  And the book ""Bread and Roses"" shows why, sweeping you into an amazingly dramatic story.23,000 workers from 50 nations walked out of the huge textile mills one bitter cold January day.  The following day, a young man from the notorious I.W.W. came to lead them.  Within a week, he had the diverse nationalities parading, singing, laughingly taunting the hundreds of militia men brought in to keep the peace.  But then things turned ugly.First, dynamite was found in the tenements.  After it proved to be a plant, mill owners sparked more violence.  A woman was killed and two IWW organizers were arrested for her murder though they were miles from the scene.Enter the colorful ""Big Bill"" Haywood in his Stetson hat. At his suggestion, mothers sent their hungry children to Manhattan where sympathetic strangers paraded ""the Children of Lawrence!!"" up Fifth Avenue and took them into their homes for safe-keeping.  The next time Haywood tried this move, police beat women at the train station and threw children into their police wagons, shocking the entire nation.  And still the strike dragged on.Relevant? A 1912 strike? There are those today who would like to take us back to that ""innocent"" time before the New Deal, before income taxes, before welfare.  (There were also no child labor laws in 1912, though today's free marketers haven't gone so far as to advocate that -- yet.)  Free market zealots see a utopia in hindsight but Bruce Watson proves the ignorance of such a dream.  ""Bread and Roses"" shows the jungle that was America in 1912 and the daily class warfare that was always lurking just below the surface.  Even if you've never read a labor history, even if you don't care at all about strikes  or strikers, you'll enjoy ""Bread and Roses"" for its heart and its humanity",1

Probably freaking out the other drivers around me as well.Like a tragic opera I can see (hear) the story of this woeful wraith alone with moan, and sorrow locked within this cellar, shrieking, screaming and wailing to be set free, The horror! The fear amplified by the darknress; The anger. When this beautiful misery ends at the triumphant break, this is where I picture the callar door finally flung open and our sad little wraith is set free, truely joyous and free to run in the sunlight, until the outro, when the mood changes...and our wraith becomes beast seeking only  his revenge on those who imprisoned him.

"As someone who grew up in Pasadena (40 years after Parsons), I found this book fascinating.  It would better subtitled, ""The Life and Times of John Whiteside Parsons"" because this book is as much about Southern California in the 1930s - 50s as anything else.  Yes, it's about Parsons' life, but the author also covers the start of Caltech, the Wilson observatory, science fiction fandom, rocketry, just plain old what life was like in Los Angeles and Pasadena for a variety of people during those years, and a myriad of other things.  If you are hesitating to read this because you think Parsons' life might not be interesting (it is, don't worry), read it for the entertaining social history if nothing else.  This isn't bogged down by the wacky occultism. ",1

"From a skilled architectual photographer one might be surprised to find the legal brothel as the subject of this elegant collection. First, the movies have created quite a different image of brothels. As opposed to the pleasure palaces of Victorian Chicago or the upstairs at the saloon, the real brothels of today's Nevada are mostly double wide house trailers singly or in groups (since in the beginning they had to be mobile because of changing zoning ordinances). The excellent large format images shown are not girly pictures and in fact there almost no human figures to be seen. Rather they are a demonstration of a part of America seldom seen and even less understood..The economics of brothels is not well studied. Naturally owners are intent on the greatest possible profits from the least investment. Since the women work on a piece work basis (no pun) it is difficult to increase the throughput of the operation. To construct a spledid brothel is almost a conflict in terms. Instead, brothels are constructed as a compromise in tastes. What is the minimum place attractive to clients who by definition are unsophisticated but that will not affect business? The women in turn concoct their living-working rooms intended to demonstrate their own taste or lack of it. For all the housewives with their fanatasies of escaping their bloated husband and being paid for those services thy have contributed in the past, the alternative of those clusters of double wides may be sometimes attractive.Hursley has captured a lonely and wistful collection of images that are classic Americana. I urge you to read the companion book, ""Brothel"" by Alexa Albert to form your own conclusions",1
"I am afraid that I have to come to the defense of ""Constellations.""  It is a very good book with very good stories in it ( my favorites were ""Fracture,"" ""As Others See Us,"" ""See No Evil,"" and ""Devices and Desires"" - though I felt that ""Make-Believe"" was rather heavy-handed).  There is not a bad story in the bunch (and I am glad that the writers didn't crossover any references, characters, etc., with any of the other STAR TREK series.  This is pure TOS).I am eager for other compilations such as this to come out in the future for the readers of the STAR TREK universe.",1
"I rushed out and bought this book after I heard the author interviewed on NPR because it sounded like a great novel to read before my first trip to India. Unfortunately, my flight time came before I'd finished its nearly 1000 pages. By that time, it had hooked me so thoroughly that I HAD to know how it came out; I couldn't just leave it at home. So, gods help me, I dragged it along. This is one honkin' heavy book, believe me. I was afraid that its weight might tip my suitcase over the rather meager limit for in-India flights, so I carried it the whole time in my hand luggage. Now, a week after coming home, my shoulder's still out of joint. But I can definitely say, it added more to my understanding of the country than any of the travel literature I read.It's a big Bollywood mess of a book--and I mean that in the nicest sense. Lots of intriguing characters, mystery, romance, big moustaches, the odd wedding, a virtuous mother, even music. Subplots and histories abound, woven deftly into the present action. Chandra has made his shady policemen, his corrupt politicians, his grasping and clawing would-be actresses, even his murderers, all sympathetic in spite of their actions. It's a long, rambling love letter to Mumbai, and yes, it's a complicated book. But Mumbai is a complicated city in a very complicated country; the scope (and the heft) of the novel feels perfect for the task it undertakes.Don't be intimidated by the foreign vocabulary. Once you decide to take the unfamiliar words in context--hint: most of them are either profanities or song lyrics--and stop skipping to the dictionary in back, you'll find yourself immersed.

"The author knows his stuff. And if I had NOT been familiar with spiritual writings (or self-help books) I might have gotten seduced by the 'logic' of the arguments or the promises for improving my relationships. However.To me, the emphasis of the presentation on the workings of the mind and spirit makes only more obvious its dissociation from the body and emotions. This book will help most people with their relationships the way yoga helps people to be flexible - through dissociation. In both cases a methodical disconnection from  the emotional markers held in the body creates a temporary sense of freedom and relief. But, these very markers hold in place personal history and uniqueness of one's life experience - not to mention energy trapped in suppressed emotions. To say that I found this book pretty useless for me, is unfortunately not enough - I believe this book is dangerous in what it creates through its seductions - a sort of spiritual and emotional brain washing. Sure, it contains powerful techniques for change - so does brain washing. And. Dissociation works quite well at first - that's why people dissociate - because it works. But. Is this a choice I really want to make? No.I don't doubt that Mr. Grayson has found a way to make the techniques in his book work for him. I also don't doubt that they worked for his clients - over time therapists polarize the clients they draw by the very nature of the approaches they refine. But. That doesn't make such an approach a good thing. The perspective which this book represents is not one I would choose for my own relationships - it would be insulting and hurtful to the people I love. I want to be close to the people I love, not float on a cloud of abstractions, basking in self-satisfied detachment. Neither would I want to attract into close relationships the kind of people this book would attract.I'm 47 years old, married for 13 years, with two children. I am an illustrator-artist (27 years), organic grower (11years) and a licensed bodyworker (14 years). I've read spiritual writings and self-help books since I was 15, and until about 5 years ago. This book was recommended to me by a well-meaning, casual friend",1
"This has so much info in it, I am afraid it had a little too much for my 11 year old.  She became a bit nervous at  some things I thought she would not.  I would not let a child read it alone, as suggested, until a parent has read it first and made sure there is nothing too mature for the individual child",1
"I got my first Belkin 7-port hub about a year ago, so this is my second one. It is absolutely one of the best things I have as a peripheral for my computer. It has it all. I wanted another to stack on the one that I have. These are amazing units and work seamlessly. All ports are 2.0, it has the two nice ports on the top for a flash drive or other input that is in an out, meaning you don't keep hooked up all the time. If the hub is near your vision you can see the flash drive loading rather than having to look on the CPU which for me is in a awkward location, it has current protection, can stack, is nice and tidy, and it lets you know which devices are on. It is so nice to have this as it makes life so much easier and its dependability is flawless. I have seen other reviews where it stopped working, but it is well worth it to give the unit a second chance as it makes computer life so much easier--it has for me. I could have my next five crash if I bought that many and would still keep going with it. Plus it has a lifetime guarantee. There is always going to be one that doesn't work, so simply stick it out until you find one that does. You won't regret it",0
"Although I have to admit that some of the older episodes have outdated special effects,I am a hardcore Trekkie so I think this collection is awsome!I particuliarly like ""Unimatrix Zero"" and ""Scorpion"",both of which contain a wealth of information about the Borg Collective.""Descent"" was ok,but it was a little strange to have Brent Spiner playing Lore and Data.""Q Who?"" is interesting since the Federation meets the Borg for the first time.""Regeneration"" was viewable,but I honestly don't care for the new ""Star Trek:Enterprise"" series.""The Best of Both Worlds"" was cool considering Picard's assimilation into the Collective.I found ""I Borg"" to be rather amusing,and the concept of possible Borg individuality was fascinating.I don't remember ""Drone"" too well because, although it was good, I watch my favorites more often.""Dark Frontier"" with the exploration of Seven's past was good,although I felt sory for Seven during her temporary reassimilation into the collective.Finally,last but not least,""Endgame"" is a remarkably good episode with Voyager's long anticipated return home and the severe blow they dealt the Collective when they managed to destroy a Borg Transwarp hub on the way. On a side note,if I have copied too much wording from other reviews I apologize.However,it has been awhile since I read the others and after many reviews not copying others is difficult, so please be assured it is unintentional",0
"I was surprised at how clear this book is. I was expecting less from a &quot;for dummies&quot; book. I had to get a struts-based web application up and running in four days flat and I bought both this book and the more highly regarded &quot;Programming Jakarta Struts&quot; by Chuck Cavaness (an O'Reilly book). I used both books, but relied extensively on the example applications in the &quot;for dummies&quot; book. When crunch time came I found myself consistently turning to the &quot;for dummies&quot; book.  Frankly, I thought it was a darn good book",1
"This book is fun to read even if you are not into baseball, but if you are, then its awesome! Its mainly made up of many different stories and experience from American baseball players who played over in Japan. The stories are about the clash in cultures whether on or off the field and most of them are really funny and you could just picture it happening. I feel that the book is more about the cultural differences between east and west and they are just using baseball as a vehicle to illustrate them. There is a movie starring Tom Selleck called Mr. Baseball that I think is a take off from this book. It is also very fun to watch",1
"This cd in my opinion is their most natural sounding and best. Im not saying I dont like the direction their heading in with constition of treason, but their starting to sound like any other metalcore band. they do still have a unique sound to them, but i really liked the style they used in determination. i also really enjoy the drum work. the song compilation is awesome, and the riffs are totally different. very easy to distinguish each song from one another, except the first two beginning tracks. all in all, their best and most creative",0
"I first heard this song last summer while I was painting our house. Out in the fresh air and the sun (and recently wed), this song immediately caught my attention and only seemed to get more irrestible with every listen. While it's what I guess I would call somewhat of a ""rock"" song (during the chorus),  it's Alex Band's vocals that conveys the longing, passionate love element of the song. He manages to keep it romantic and unique instead of just making it a another decent rock song. I've also heard Chad's version from the album; while Chad's vocals are actually not *that* much different from Alex's (both manage to be very masculine and strong), I feel that the version with Chad is a ""good"" song while Alex's delivery makes it a ""great"" song. While Chad's voice is great for other songs, for this type of song it is overly domineering and angry-sounding. From a woman's perspective, Alex's way would manage to convince me to ""get together"" while Chad's would scare me off! Sometimes, one vocalist is just ""meant"" to sing a song and either make it or break it. Think of ""Smooth"" from 1999. Rob Thomas' delivery helped to make that song the hit it was. In this case, Alex is the perfect man for the job.",0
"I had long straight all one length hair, the kind of hair people wish they had. Then I gave birth to the love of my life and my hair went to S**T!! It went frizzy, for 8 years I tried expensive, cheap anything (so, I thought) that said would help frizzy hair. Then I heard of Phyto, Yepee!! Between PhytoBrush and Defrisant, I have my hair back. IT'S NOT FRIZZY ANYMORE. If you are anything like me, on a budget and really can't afford it. Save up. You only have to use a little to help. And the peace of mind it gives you (your sanity back)no more bad hair days. Is worth the price by far. I'll never go back. PLEASE try it. Love your hair again",0
"Agreed - this is some of the best songs I heard Albert play on record.  Truly an excellent collection.  You'll hear not only Albert's awesome soulful singing but also a LOT of intense blues guitar, which is truly ""King"".  The sound quality leaves more to be desired, but it is acceptable.  Material more than makes up for it.  I played this record to someone who's never heard Albert King's material before and they were shocked.  I'm a fan of Albert King, and this is a valuable disc in my collection",0
"This is one of the best CDs I have heard in years!  The singing is lovely but not overdone, and the selection of songs is impeccable!  I highly recommend this to any Christian music fan.  It will be especially powerful for anyone who has spent years in Mass listening to these moving and powerful songs",0
"This compilation was the 'last chance' read for dan abnett in my book, after what I considered contrived or overt insertion of coincidences to introduce plot items or devices/resolutions in First and Only and Fell Cargo.  I particularly felt first and only was entirely too contrived in the introduction of elements of gaunt's background, each as needed for the plot.  Maybe he was limited in space or had strict outlines there, but in any event....this series had none of those flaws.  First-person narrative read well, and usually quickly, with no sense of contrived coincidences just to move the plot along, and few if any of the cliche plot turns that I disliked in the books i mentioned above.  In short, the eisenhorn books are great.  I wish there were more",1
"This ""definitive"" collection is a MUCH better album than their original hits album back in the 1980s.  There are TWICE as many songs, the sound quality is great, and the liner notes are exceptional.  This collection is for both the fans and casual",0
"Well, first, Randy Newman is unbelievably talented. He is a song writer, a singer, and last but not least at all, a film composer. And what a composer! This multi talent has a family name, which can be a real pain in the ars. But Randy seems not to be bothered by it at all. He wrote some of the most beautiful scores of the 90-s. His music for Pleasantville should have won him an Oscar. But remember The Natural, Toy Story, Awakenings, just to name a few. This really nice compilation and anthology gives Newman the treatment he has long time deserved. I love the title: Guilty: 30 years of Randy Newman. This man does not seem to take himself serious. Yet his art is pretty serious, and he is aware of it very much. Randy Newman is there in the world of music, yet he is not there. You have to listen to this man to get to know him, and once you meet him, you do not want to part from him, he will be a friend of yours forever.Randy Newman is right by the side of the greatest composers, Williams, Goldsmith, Bernstein or his late uncle Alfred Newman.Buy this anthology and get to know this musical giant",0
"Faced with impossible relativism, falsehood, the impossibly of truth, what can our reaction be? To laugh: the ludic as an alternative to the despair of nihilism. The discourse is hilarious, and at key moments when the action is most intense, and the characters are being most lead astray from their purposes, they are overcome by a hilarity and a hysteria which incapacitates them, and often the reader too...Read more from Murr on The Lectern:[...",1
"This book should be removed from press; not because of a ""gun stance"", but because it has been shown to be a completely inaccurate record with fabricated data.If you want to read on the firearms controversy in the US, there are plenty of HONEST books from each side.  Make your decision based on actual information, not the writer's imagination.  Bellesiles won early acclaim for his work mainly from reviewers living in the northeast US where there is greater support for gun control.  I suspect nobody checked on the validity of his work because it came to the conclusions they supported. The accuracy of a HISTORY text should never be judged based on the political leanings of the reviewer.   Bellesiles went into this work with his mind made up, and fabricated data to fit that viewpoint; I'm sure writers on the other side of the debate have done the same thing, but I've not read their books so I can't tell you the titles.In any case, both are wrong.Don't waste your time on this book.  If you want facts on the firearms controversy, read some other books.  If you want fiction, read Tolkien...it's better written",1
"If I were to recommend a single &quot;must have&quot; book about the Great Basin Desert, this would be the one! It is the single best one-volume introduction to the natural history of the Great Basin that I know of, and is well illustrated with his own photography. He was writing on behalf of the Desert Research Institute, and spent six years on this particular project. Stephan Trimble exemplifies the best traditions in writing about Natural History. He combines the scientific reason and clarity of a Voltaire, with the poetic sensitivity of Rousseau. My copy is so bedraggled from being packed all over the Basin, I've got to get a new one soon",1

"Enough can not be said about these wonderful videos!  Not only do we own EVERY Disney Sing Along cartoon video, we own the Holiday ones and the Character ones as well (Campout etc..).  Nothing entertains my 5 yo. and 1 1/2 yo. like these tapes do.  The music is good for them, the word recognition is good for them, they are familiar with many characters now (which makes going to the park WAY MORE FUN! - they dont have to have watched every movie to know most characters). Great for little ones with short attention spans since it changes characters with each song and the music keeps them hopping! I feel no guilt at all letting them watch alone while I cook or unload the dishwasher as I gaze over at my two happy, singing, dancing girls!  Best baby sitter in the UNIVERSE!  I also think it will help them when they are older and start to read - They have been a staple to our VHS collection since my eldest was a toddler! WELL WORTH THE MONEY",0
"This is about as comprehensive a yearbook as I have ever seen for any sport. There is so much information packed in this colorful volume that it would take you a year just to get through it all. But for people in the States who can't get enough of soccer/football, there is no other book better than the Soccer Yearbook by David Goldblatt.Every region of the world is color-coded for easy reference. Maps of cities, like Milan, make it easy to spot the locations of famous stadiums around the world. Maps of countries show all the teams, their jersey colors, their founded date, and so much more. Filled with color photos and loaded with amazing stats, this is a football fan's dream tome.Look no further. This is an awesome reference tool for the soccer fan in YOUR life",1

"I was very excited to get this book, but it has so much description of what amounts to torture of dogs in it, that I just can't read more of it and am actually ashamed to have it.  It was written by someone who doesn't seem to have any regard for the wellbeing of housepets and did horrible experiments on dogs for questionable gains.  I'm not a member of PETA and am generally thick-skinned, but this one gave me nightmares.  What they did to get the information isn't worth the outdated information the book contains",1

"In my opinion this is the way games are supposed to be: the rules are easy to understand, and easily learned in 5 minutes. A typical game takes about 15 minutes. Mastering the game takes much longer --- I can't tell you how long, because I haven't mastered it yet.I've played this game quite a few times now, and am amazed at the complexity involved in the game play. In every move you make, you have to judge the tradeoff in the knowledge you gain and the knowledge you give your opponent(s). You can even try to fool your opponent(s), by making a move that would seem obviously wrong from your point of view (but the confusion may pay off later on).I would say that it is a much more interesting game than Mastermind, or most games, because it depends less on chance and more on skill. It can be a great lesson in logic reasoning and game theory. I would say that CODA can be almost as interesting as complex games like go, bridge or chess, but much easier to learn and quicker to play.I concur with one of the other reviews I read: CODA is a classic in the making.Highly recommended",0
"Kawabata is more difficult to translate into english than say someone like Mishima. He lets us view a pre-war Japan mind set that can sometimes seem a little alien to the westerner. This is his difficulty and his genius. The courtly aristocratic Go master playing against the much younger more modern challenger lets us see in microcosm the change in Japan from the pre-war aristocracy to a more egalitarian society. Kawabata is careful to show good and bad sides of both these individual Go players. Much is lost and a little is gained in this transistion for Japan. That is the impression Kawabata gives in this narrative of a late 1930s Go championship game. This novel is mostly non fiction and is told in a light aesthetic style. In reading this I am reminded a little of the 1972 Fischer vs Spassky Chess match in Iceland. I was a teenage novice chess enthusiast at the time and the reports of the many disagreements kept me glued to the nightly news. The disagreements in this Go match of course were nothing to compare to that famous Chess match. The author was covering this Go match for a newspaper and he was on the scene as an eye-witness, because of this the narrative carries a sense of reality not often found in fiction. Quite simply a mesmerizing read",1
"Louis Gluck writes brilliant poems which meander around the serious issues of existence ,life ,love ,alienation ,separation,memories and dreams.This is a prose exposition of a collection of her essays which in a way talk of the methods of her craft and give her thoughts on tangible topics such as a critique of the works of T.S.Eliot and more abstract ideas such as the need for brevity in poetry.In another sense these prose meditations are in fact an adjunt to her poems and are meaningful in their own right.From apparently nowhere come profound ideas ,i quote&quot;When you read anything worth remembering,you liberate a human voice;you release into the world again a companion spirit&quot;.Louise Gluck is herself a voice well worth listening to ,a contemporary philosopher who can address the important issues fearlessly and with clarity of thought .A gem of a book don't miss it",1
"     Okay, so this movie is dumb.  But, if you can get past that, it's hysterical.  It has so many memorable lines that it really deserves a better reputation.  When you consider tasteless comedies like 'Scary Movie' or 'American Pie', 'Bachelor Party' is right up there with the funniest of the rauchiest.  The plot is weak, as is Tawny Kitaen's performance, but there are so many funny scenes and lines that it doesn't matter.  Tom Hanks is the only good guy in the movie.  All the other characters are obnoxious and/or irritating.  But, somehow, most everyone is funny, one way or another.  ""We are now leaving Nun Central on our journey to HELL AND BEYOND!!!",0

"This book is great!  Lupica tells the story of an old Mets pitcher trying to make a comeback.  His use of real players and baseball history makes this story seem like a non-fictional biography.  For anyone that was a ball player and loves this great game will relate to everything the main charactor (Charlie Stoddard) goes through.  From the pains of throwing a baseball your entire life to the night life of a pro ball player; his interaction with other teammates, the great pitcher/catcher relationship and the infamous Red Sox Vs Yankess rilvary.  This book is a page turner and is extremely difficult to put down once you've started.  Any true baseball fan will love this book",1
"I read this book,a couple years back and was somewhat skeptical,initially. I wondered if just measuring brain metabolism in certain areas can really give you a full picture of whats going on. Still,other parts of the book seemed to contain good advice and insights.After some discussion with family, I decided what the hell,and went ahead and got the pricey standard workup at the Amen Clinic, 2 SPECT scans, etc. Keep in mind that insurance does not cover this, at least not in my experience.The clinic was reasonably professional,although Dr Amen himself came off as quite pompous. He's also quite short,about 5'4.The prescriptions I was given did not make much difference in the 2-3 months I was on them. To get them renewed I would have had to travel a long distance back to the expensive Amen Clinic. My local pdoc did not have much respect for Dr. Amens reccomendations,(which I understand now)so in the end,it was a big waste.I later found out Dr Amen is a fundamentalist Christian,and is a fan of Pat Robertson. It didnt surprise me, as he didnt come off as a very tolerant person.I suggest you do a google search on ""Dr. Amen"" + ""quack"" to at least see both sides of the story. Im sure he has helped some people with SPECT,but in my case it was like throwing money down the drain.",1
"This book is up to date in its information.  It is very informative, and reader friendly.  It explains the cause of some mental illness, addictions, phobias and anxieties.

I am impressedwith its ability to record each song or each XM satellite channel.With each song recording, you manually press the record button withinthe songs first 45 seconds of play, the Nexus50 records the entiresong, then stops the recording process.If you want to record a designated channel for a long period,the Nexus50 gives you 50 hours of recording time and saveseach individual song on its own track, just like a compact disc.The Nexus50 also allows you to schedule the recording of yourfavorite shows/channels in advance with its built in scheduler.Switching from channel to channel could be a little easier if theNexus50 was built with a radio dial like I've seen on othersatellite radios.Overall, I enjoy the user friendly functionality of the Nexus50and would highly recommend it.",0

The young man took top academic honors graduating eighth grade middle school, so it takes a little work to keep up intellectually with him.  But it took no effort to read this book.  It reads effortlessly and beautifully, the poetry ringing through in the ringing prose.  A compelling, thrilling adventure story, clever narrow escapes, a love story to inspire the least romantic, wrongs decisively avenged, fantasy anchored in an ancient reality, history made enjoyable and memorable, a cast of characters Tolstoy must have envied (and perhaps emulated), a story leaving one with a wish for a sequel.  And now I know the proper pronunciation of Odysseus.  Do you",1
"I would certainly agree with the reviewers who have said this is a great start for those who don't own any Sinatra albums.  I have recommended and/or purchased this particular CD for a number of friends and family members who were previously unaware of the genius of the Chairman of the Board.This particular CD is a nice sampler of his work during the Capitol years (1953-1960).  In my opinion, his voice during this period was at its peak.  This should in no way be interpreted to mean that his work for Columbia and/or Reprise was subpar and I would certainly recommend anyone interested in Sinatra to listen to the music from those years as well.  That being said, these recordings, mainly arranged and conducted by the great Nelson Riddle, are beyond reproach. Whether it's a bar room ballad or a swinging song, Nelson and Sinatra are perfectly in sync.  If you do purchase this disc please be forwarned, you'll soon find yourself purchasing many more. ",0

"All I have to say is that i regret the fact that this is my first Jeffery Deaver book because this book is so fun and entertaining that I'm sold on Deaver and am looking to read the rest of his books. I read this book in two sittings because I simply could not put it down because I was so involved and really wanted/needed to know what was next. This story isn't about the reader trying to figure out who the antagonist is (you actually learn is identity pretty early) but is instead about the mind/computer games the good guys play with the bad guys and who will be one step ahead, and are they really ahead, or far behind? There are so many twists and turns in this book that you'll read it just as quickly as I did. I'm officially a Deaver fan now, and I recommend you pick up this book",1

The authors reports and commments on the market posted on the net daily, together with refering constantly to the book, gives me a true feeling of the market.I truly believe that every trader should use the book, not just own or have the book, but use it........

"Being an athletic training student, this is by far the most useful book i have bought. It has the muscle testing in simple terms with pictures.  I recommend if for anybody going to be an athletic trainer",1
This book is a very easy read and quiet entertaining for both myself and my husband.  The author points out the humorus side of a lot of the things couples struggling with infertility are faced with.  It makes it a lot more endurable when you can see the funny in it.  I would recommend this book for anyone struggling with infertility!  Laughter truely is the best medicine,1

"This is the book for all Eagles fans. Re-live the magic of last years run to the Super Bowl. This book has incredible stories about Trotter, Ike Reese, and Donovan McNabb. Learn about a softer, gentler, nicer side of Terrell Owens.The book even includes some insight into the final minutes of the Super Bowl.",1
"By Dr. Ian Irvine, co-editor The Animist Creating Sanctuary is a powerful piece of writing by an almost extinct professional breed - the psychiatrist/psychologist prepared to examine the  bigger picture in regards to the causes of psychic distress in modern  Western societies.  The book undoubtably belongs to a long tradition of  humanistic and Freudian writings on mental illness as produced by modern  Western social structures. The title itself recalls Fromm's book 'The Sane  Society' and I would argue that in many ways Bloom has given us a powerful  update on themes covered in that now classic work. One also thinks of works  by Arthur Janov (especially his work on trauma suppression), Alice Miller,  De Mauss, Mickel Adzema, Wilhelm Reich (and the Bioenergetic tradition),  Stanislav Grof  and many others who have applied  Freudian and Humanistic  ideas to the social arena. In this sense the work is also in a kind of  refracted dialogue with that great Freudian text Civilisation and its  Discontents. The picture of modern society - particularly modern American  society - painted for us by Bloom is not a pretty one. Sanity and psychic  health is seen as a virtual impossibility in the face of a normalised  climate of repression and institutionalised trauma creation. The central  obsessions of our consumeristic, violence and money obsessed modern world  are described in terms of a general malaise polluting and undermining the  psychic integrity of individuals and collectives alike. Bloom accurately  describes to us a world characterised by institutional harshness, denial  (that there even is a crisis!) and outright disinterest in the truly  important issues to do with trauma and violence that now shape our   collective social psyches.  In this climate, psychiatrists, psychologists,  social workers and other health care professionals seem all but unable to  act in the best interests of their clients. In this sense, Bloom criticises  the faceless bureacrats, lawyers and insurance moguls who increasingly  shape and infringe upon the client patient relationship: often forcing  psychiatrists to opt for functionalist alienated treatment regimes over  potentially more humane and effective ones. The insight that society is not  so much interested in curing people who have fallen victim to the  collective (in)humanity we call a society, as in making money out of the  later life effects of trauma suppression is a disturbing under-current to  the book. There is a great deal to this book, far more than I could cover  in a short review like this. The work is groundbreaking in its merged  sociological and psychological methodology. More importantly, however, it  stands as powerful indictment  of the way in which modern societies act to  undermine and subtly traumatise large sections of their populations. A must  read",1

"Hugo's Notre-Dame de Paris is usually translated into English as The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, giving the impression that Quasimodo, the hunchback, is the hero of the novel.  In truth, this is a story without a true hero or a true villain.  The original French title is more apt because the central character is the cathedral itself, overshadowing, shaping and constraining the merely human lives that are played out in and around it.  If the story has a villain it is Fate; blind, merciless and unremitting.  There is however a heroine, La Esmeralda, and she alone of all the characters makes us laugh and cry.Hugo can be prolix.  For what Dickens will say in a sentence, and Dostoevski in a paragraph, Hugo will employ a chapter, when the mood takes him.  I hate the idea of abridgements and I would normally never recommend skipping or skimming any part of a great work, but Hugo is a possible exception.  The thirty-odd pages devoted to A Bird's Eye View of Paris can be safely skipped over, unless you are a bird.  Everything else is essential, or at least worthwhile.  Neither does the author skimp on the use of coincidence, and the plot relies on one 'who-should-it-be-but' coincidence in particular which is so convenient and unlikely that most readers will groan when they realize what it is.  The charitable interpretation is that the book is after all about Fate and its inevitability.Despite those quibbles, the novel is a resounding 5-star must-read.  It is astonishingly imaginative and includes scenes, especially those in the prison, and at the very end, that are as powerful, disturbing and memorable as anything in literature.  I will say no more about them, because I hate spoilers even more than I do abridgements.  Needless to say, if you think you know the story from movie versions, you don't.",1
"This little book, mainly a picture book with some text, is a gem! My 4 year old carries it around with her to nursery school and Grandma's house. Her 3 year old twin cousins take it to bed and put it under their pillow.Neither the parents or the grandparents tire of rereading it with them over and over. The children are also building their own fairy houses in the yard with the help of older siblings. Everybody's involved. 5 stars",1
"Even though I'm not a teacher, I give it an A+! This is a well written book based on first-hand experience and industry knowledge. It truly is a ""must read"" for anyone wanting to go into franchising.

New franchisees will be at the ""head of the class"" with information garnered from this book. ",1
"When this book first came out, I remember reading it straight through three times. And I sent it to nearly every writer or spiritual seeker I knew. Today, I was looking on my bookshelf hoping for inspiration on a book to send a new friend who is in the midst of a spiritual struggle (though I see it as an awakening). I picked up Ms. Goldberg's book and started thumbing through it. Before I knew it, the time had flown by and I'd completely forgotten about my work... yikes-my deadline! I just ordered a copy for my friend, and am going to reread the book myself. This is what makes it so great: it is honest and authentic. It is like sitting in a room with someone and having them decribe a fascinating and compelling journey. It is the complications of zen practice made simple to understand. Reading it is exactly the experience the title suggests... it is a journey. For anyone who understands the struggle to ""wake up."" This is a beautiful book to keep by your side. ",1
"This book was a great read. It was better than any historical fiction because it is so unbelievably real. Yet, the book reads with the tension of a plot which could not have been crafted better by a Dostievsky or Hugo. If  the subject interests you, I say- read this book",1
"Reckon I'll have to put out good money for this book.  University of Maryland doesn't carry it, nor does the consortium of seven private university libraries, and nor does the Montgomery County (Md) Public Library.This despite an interesting and relevant topic and reasonably robust sales.  Hmmmm(I add a year later) I have now read the book.  It is refreshingly direct, in the voices of Boalt Hall students themselves.  A few anonymous, and a few who disagree with the book's thesis.  Still five stars",1

"My aunt in Australia sent this book for my daughter's 1st Christmas and it has become one of my favorites to read. Since my daughter is only 5 months old, I try to find books with nice simple sentences (not too wordy) and captivating pictures. This book is beautifully illustrated with unusual animals and tells a sweet story. My daughter enjoys it, and from my perspective, it's much more interesting than a lot of baby books--important since I read it over and over again.This book is obviously meant for a bit older child, but I wanted to point out that it is also a good one for babies. She will be able to enjoy it for a long time",1
"Background:  I have a strong background in mathematics and image processing. I was looking for a book that could re-introduce me to the field of morphometrics.  I had done some basic land-mark morphometrics before and wanted to return to the field.Contrary to its title, this book is not about morphometrics for the life sciences.  It is about the Fourier Descriptors methods and about de-bunking any other method.  The book is divided by the author in two parts.  The first part is dedicated to the history of measurement with strong emphasis on the politics involved, particularly the role of the (Catholic?) Church. I found this first part mildly interesting for historical curiosity, but completely irrelevant to the current morphometrics knowledge.  The second part of the book (Morphometric Techniqhes) is supposed to cover different methods for morphomety.  It does not. The second part includes chapters on Multivariate Morphometrics (Chapter 7) and Coordinate Morphometrics (Chapter 8).  These two chapters (both less than 20 pages long) are devoted to highlighting the drawbacks of multivariate and coordinate morphometrics without giving enough mathematical background for the beginner to learn about them or to form an educated assessment of the methods.  Boundary morphometrics (Chapter 9) is dedicated mostly to Fourier descriptors, the author's specialty.  The chapter is allotted more than 35 pages, includes a mathematical background lacking in in other chapters, and -in contrast to other chapters, it does not mention any drawbacks of the Fourier descriptors. The book overemphasises the ""information preserving"" property of Fourier descriptors at the expense of morphometric techniques designed to  assess differences.  The only useful  information I found in this book was the list of references regarding the methods this book tries to debunk",1
"As another reviewer has already pointed it, this collection would make an EXCELLENT intro to the wonders of classical music, as well as a must-have for Mozart fans. Even if you already have these pieces, having it on one collection makes the drive to work a pleasure rather than a chore. Highly recommend",1
"Exhaustively researched and beautifully written, this story of three young men killed in the slaughter of the First World War is heartwrenching, perhaps because so much of it is told in their own words. The boys - English, German and American -  were keen observers and articulate reporters, detailing the horrors of trench warfare in their letters and diaries. Balancing personal accounts in the book are cold numbers, among them the toll of the first day of the Battle of the Somme: 57,000 British troops",1
"The only complaint is that this book isn't longer.  This is how it all begins for Bertie and Jeeves, and several of the incidents related become references in the later stories.  Having read this collection after reading some later works, it was interesting to see how it all started.  Brilliant, and as a previous reviewer noted, the only question is what edition of this book to buy.  For the money, this one was perfect for me",1
"This 'personal' teapot is such a joy to look at as well as use! The handle is very user friendly and very generous in its proportion but not too much to look out of scale to the pot's body. The lid's knob is the best I've ever encountered - no more slipping out of your fingers. It is a flat design with slight indents to really get a grip, and the trademark triangular shape makes an art statement to the roundness of the body.As for the Aubergine color - beautiful! This shade of purple is  not garish or gaudy, but very classy and rich looking. Though the picture shows a shiny finish, it is matte but definitely has a wonderful luster and is not dull by any means. The tea pours out in a nice arc from the high position of the spout, another small joy if you like waterfall features.What's NOT to love about this cute teapot. You'll enjoy looking at the pot as much as you'll enjoy your tea experiments. By the way, this teapot's bigger version is just as wonderful and has a very ingenious ceramic tea infuser that attaches into the lid for easy use - now is that cool or what?!",0
"As if they didn't have anything else to do... I love watching this movie. It brings back memories of a time when I used to swim in the lake. I once saw a van down by the river, but never looking inside. I assumed they had ice cream. I was hoping all along that Bennett would let off some steam... And guess what? He did. Nothing else to say but, watch the damn movie, then go on with your life. There nothing here to see folks, keep moving",0
"Dr. Joshi has done a great job with this book.  The principles of Ayurveda are clearly presented in a way you can identify with.  Many other books are over cumbersome and difficult to comprehend or apply to your life.  Joshi  shares home remedies as well as a succinct description fo Pancha Karma.  If  we all did this deep cleansing/nourishing rejuvenation program on a regular  basis we would not only improve our quality of life but our cash flow as  well, without the abundance of prescriptions masking the real source of  dis---ease.  Thanks Dr. Joshi for sharing the ancient knowledge of  Ayurveda",1
"This book tells it like it is.  For parents not looking for a copout, but for support.  As a parent of 2 ADD children (and stepparent of 2 ADHD children) this book makes a lot of sense.  He brings up some good points  about expecting too much out of our children and looking for ways to make  them smarter, better, etc., without putting more time and effort into it.   Parenting is a fulltime job, more difficult than any other job.  I remember  feeling the relief when Dr's told me it was &quot;not their fault or my  fault, it is all a medical problem.&quot;  Well, through the years, I've  learned there are things different I can do, and some things I cannot  change.  We have been able to keep 2 of our kids off Ritalin (it caused bad  rebound affects on two, one was zombie-like and one turned into a  holy-terror after the medicine wore off everyday).  One of our kids may be  on it his whole life though, he just cannot function. Unfortunately, the  book doesn't come up with a cure, but it also tells you the truth about  Ritalin, RITALIN IS NOT A CURE!   It does have its place with some  children, but in my opinion, it is a bandaid on a bleeding woun",1
"Wislawa Szymborska was barely known to the rest of the world until 1996 when it was announced that she was bestowed the Nobel Prize for Literature by the Swedish Academy. Anyway, Wislawa's poetry is quite charming. It's not difficult to read. In fact, it's easy to read and she makes poetry look too easy to write. Poetry is the hardest of all genres in literature. I am a writer who does not care too much for poetry because it's not my cup of tea but she wins me over with her style. She makes it easy to read but I bet it's not easy. Her poetry is about quality and not quantity. Sure there are other poets who deserved the Nobel Prize for literature but Wislawa was a surprise and a delightful one. It hasn't changed her a bit. She still lives in the same 3 room flat in Cracow where she has lived most of her life. We don't even have an autobiography or biography about her. Even now, she has maintained her privacy and rarely ventures into the spotlight. As an aspiring writer myself, I hope I can maintain the same humbleness as Wislawa. She is my heroine of literature. I was lucky to get this book when it came out after Wislawa's honor. I am surprised that it is no longer readily available. Even with translation, the meaning of her poetry is not lost on us especially with people on a bridge.",1
"Sure, some spots are slow and very detailed, however the rest of the book makes up for that.  I am amazed by the future technology that he discusses, technology that is just now being discussed in the press, and much that is a reality.  Such as laser engine drives, or optical storage, and nano technology.  So believable, in fact I am not surprised when I hear another news report of a new technology that Buzz wrote about in 1977",1

I work as a teacher at a small Bay Area school and I was looking for an eye-catching tool for my students to learn about the world of graphic design.

"I watched all the Miss Marple's as my Mother &amp; I are big fans of Agatha Christie's many books. I watched the series when it ran years ago, and was looking forward with great anticiption to the DVD's. I must say this is the worst job of transferring a beautifully produced television series to DVD. There were so many artifacts from cramming everything onto single disks that they are in many cases, completely unviewable. I would recommend renting this set from Netflix or somewhere before purchasing them. This is such a major disappointment. I loved the series and waited with great anticipation for their release, only to discover they're unwatchable",0
"This book is comprehensive and deeply moving.  I could not put it down.  I was disgusted and angry by the end of it.  I am ashamed to be Irish and ashamed to be Catholic.  How this could have gone on for so long with no help for these children is beyond words.  If there is a hell, then open arms to all those sick and sadistic Brothers and Nuns, all of whom were operating in the name of God....!  How dare they call themselves charitable and merciful.  They are some of the most vile human beings in existence.  Between that and the sex scandal in America, the Catholic Church owes many people an apology and some sort of restitution.  For shame the Church still chooses to cover up it's misuse of power.  If the Nuns and Priests and Brothers were not so sexually frustrated, maybe they wouldn't be so evil.  Sorry to vent so strongly.  After reading this book, you will feel the same way.  Also read Do Penance or Perish, but not as good as this book.  Thank you",1
"Rosemary's music of the early fifties reflected the times in which they were recorded, featuring some truly brilliant songs culled from a variety of sources interspersed with the occasional silly song..The set includes five of Rosemary's seven UK hits, the omissions being Man and Where will the baby's dimple be, but neither of them matter in a collection like this. The five UK hits included here are This ole house, Mambo Italiano (both number hits), Half as much, Hey there (both top five hits) and Mangos (a minor hit). This ole house, the song most readily identified with Rosemary by UK fans, returned to the very top of the UK charts when revived by rock'n'roll revivalist Shakin' Stevens in 1981.In America, Rosemary had many more hits but although this is an American compilation, some big hits are omitted to make way for less obvious but welcome recordings. The really big hits are all here including the number one hits Come on a my house, This ole house, Hey there and Half as much, together with the number two hit Botch-a-me, a novelty song that really doesn't stand the test of time well but the public must have loved it at the time to take it that high.The biggest omission is a Christmas song that made the top ten, but I'm happy with that. I love Christmas music but I prefer it to be kept separate from other recordings, especially where the singer has recorded enough Christmas songs to fill at least half a CD. This particular recording is on Rosemary's CD, Songs from White Christmas and other yuletide favorites. The next biggest hit missing is Beautiful brown eyes, which almost made the top ten on Billboard, peaking at eleven. It might have made the top ten in another American chart. While this omission is more of a disappointment, it can be found on the more recent compilation Country Rose. That set includes twenty-one tracks from the early fifties, drawing on Rosemary's country-influenced recordings. This ole house and Half as much (both of which were originally country songs) are also to be found on that set, but they are the only duplicates. So you can rectify those two omissions by purchasing Songs from White Christmas and Country Rose.Rosemary eventually became a highly respected jazz singer and clues to her later success can be found here via the inclusion of her covers of In the cool cool cool of the evening, Sophisticated lady and Blues in the night. But mainly, this is about Rosemary's early pop hits.While this is not a definitive hits collection, the essential hits British and American hits are all here so it's a good starting point. If you wish to explore Rosemary's music from this period further, there are plenty of other CD's available, a couple of which I've mentioned",0
"I'm prejudiced -- my father wrote this book.  He designed a cast aluminum dutch oven for a piece of cookware that the Boy Scouts could pack in their backpacks.  Everyone wanted to know, &quot;what can you cook in it&quot;?   His answer was always, &quot;anything you can cook in the oven in your  kitchen you can cook in the dutch oven&quot;.  These recipes are fast and  easy and can be used whether you are eating in our camping out.  I hope you  will buy and try these recipes as a testament to a man who dedicated 60 of  his 75 years to Boy Scouting!  He passed away in 1990 but left behind a  bunch of full stomachs.  Thanks",1
"I am not a mountain climber but this book kept me spellbound.  The author did a very good job maintaing objectivity, although it was clear that greed and competition between the two climbing groups was the main reason this disaster happened:  neither man wanted to back down from the mountain and give up his quest to be first at the summit, they had become oblivious to the incoming storm.  This cost several climbers their lives.The author was also quite good at describing not just the event, but also the terrain (trash all over the mountain crevaces), the sherpas, and even a personality profile of every climber on the quest.  In the end we all cheer for all of them to make it, even when we know that some won't.The hardest part to read was the last chapter, when Krakauer went to interview the climbers after the event. Krakauer's other books are just as good, namely ""Into the Wild.""  He certainly does a very good job researching his topics.I read this book in one night because I couldn't put it down",1
"Jill McCorkle seems to be trying too hard to be unique and quirky just for the sake of being ""original."" I was attracted to this book because I like fiction written from the point of view of many characters, but ""Carolina Moon"" was an amalgam of too many different styles that just wouldn't blend. We have letters, we have third person narration, and we have first person narration in the form of an annoying young woman talking to a tape recorder diary. Too much.This last narration bothered me because the woman didn't sound like she was talking to a tape recorder - the voice sounds more like a written voice. For example, she barely distinguishes who's speaking, which is fine on the page where you can see indents and paragraphs and quotation marks, but as a spoken voice it didn't work. She didn't sound like a real person. The point of having someone tell his or her story through a tape recorder diary is to capture his/her voice more naturally. McCorkle just tells the story this way because it's ""neat."" The character doesn't sound any different from any of the other characters - and her story is pointless and contributes nothing to the plot or sublot or second subplot.Quee was just plain annoying. She's an old, quirky prostitute medicine woman who collects pictures of people she doesn't know and makes stories up about them. She was quirky and had a quirky perspective on morals, so we're supposed to like her. I hated her. I'm tired of fiction about crazy, quirky people trying to force their agendas down our throats. The best novel I've read about a quirky person was ""A Separate Peace"" because the narrator in that novel gets just as annoyed at the quirky character as the reader. (And he pushes him out of a tree.) Read that book instead.I think McCorkle may just have been suffering from some quirkiness herself when she wrote this book. The characters are flat and uninteresting, and the stories are bland. There's no reason for the unnamed woman to drop letters to her dead lover in the mailbox except to advance the story. And the only purpose the mailman has is to read the letters to us. The characters are more like the author's pawns than real people. The book didn't really seem to be about anything, and the ending was unbelievable (in a bad way, not a good way). I was surprised because McCorkle is usually a very good character writer. Her short story ""Intervention"" is a marvelous story about a woman torn between her alcoholic husband and her children, who wish to have an intervention. Great character in that story. I'd recommend reading McCorkle's short stories instead of ""Carolina Moon.""",1

"First of all FLOETIC was a brilliant album and after I heard SUPERSTAR on the radio I thought FLO'OLOGY was going to be a classic too. I was wrong. This album lacks originality, its inferior to be precise. The first time I popped this CD into the system, I found myself being friends with the skip forward button. The length of the records is despicable This CD is not worth having....the only track that stands out for me is SUPERSTAR and I think COMMON is amazing",0
"I work with children in environmental education.  One thing that never ceases to amaze me is that many children have no concept of the soil except that it is dirty!  This book helps the reader examine this presious resource and contemplate the longevity of soil and the importance of it in a fun manner.  Hooper takes the child on a creative adventure of reliving some of the possible experiences of the piece of rock that they take for granted.  Although a scientific topic, &quot;A Rock in my Pocket&quot; is also a delightful romp through the history of the earth.  I highly recommend this book for any child who thinks soil is dirty, and even for those who think it is cool.  In addition, Hooper's book &quot;A Drop in my Drink&quot; deals with water in the same manner.  You should not get one of these books and not the other",1
"Recently purchased the Cinemate system to improve sound quality for my new SONY HD TV in our family room which has very good picture but very poor sound. Cinemate is extremely easy to set up and will provide much better sound than most TV speakers. Improved clarity in the speaking parts and much richer musical aspects and effects. Enough bass for family room viewing. It is NOT going to be the equivalent of a media room type system and I don't think it is intended to be. When I want to blast the plaster I go upstairs to that room. It is the perfect system for a multi use room where one member of the family does not want wires, cords and equipment showing all over the place but someone else wants better than average sound. Keeping in mind this sets up about like and as easy as a PC based speaker system and produces nice sound with NO receiver I was impressed. If you buy it for what it is designed to do...there  is nothing else like it on the market. ",0
"I have become quite an expert on ""The Phantom of the Opera"" since being blown away by the awesome beauty of the film version of Lloyd Webber's play. I take the fifth on how many times I've seen the movie which I HIGHLY recommend. This book, and Susan Kay's book PHANTOM,are my favorites!  Andrew Lloyd Webber was consulted about this story continuation of his play and approved of it.  It's a fast read and has some surprises and interesting plot twists that make it fun to read and ponder. I highly recommend it and keep giving copies of it to family and friends",1
"Against the Gods is a fantastic book for people who love to read the history of risk, dating back as far as to the greeks. Bernstein's passion to the topic makes it a clear 5 star book. And he's passions shows on almost every page. Example: if you are just interested in the Markowitz formula, don't buy this book. But if you wanna read that Markowitz's methodology is a synthesis of the ideas of Pascal, de Moivre, Bayes, Laplace, Guass, Galton, Daniel Bernoulli (especially since he's had the same nationality than me) and von Neumann & Morgenstern. Furthermore, that Markowitz's methodolgy draws on probability theory, on sampling, on the bell curve and dispersion around the mean, on regression to the mean, and on utility theory. If this history is what interests you, this book is for you (if not only for the great title & book cover) ",1

"The story goes that Paul decided to end the band after discovering that John had turned over the Let It Be tapes to Phil Spector behind his back, and muzaked his beloved Long and Winding Road.  But truely the real end came with Paul's refusal to release the last song on this anthology.Both John and Paul had a knack for tapping into the rapidly evolving zeitgeist of the 60's.  All You Need is Love may seem a little precious at this far removed time, but it was the perfect world rally rant at the peak of the summer of love.  Similarly, the world's attention in early '68 was on the Beatles celebrated trip to India to study with the Mahariji.  What secret had they learned that they could impart on us?  Of all the songs written during that sabbatical, the one that would have satisfied the curiousity of of the current youth culture was John's vision of spiritual wonder and inner peace, Across the Universe.  A beautifully tranquil mantra to allow the fans a couple of weeks to contemplate before moving on.But the ever competetive Paul would not hear of it.  He was working on his very catchy, paternal influenced Lady Madonna. Brian was no longer around to intervene with his wonderful sense of timing.  John's moment to capitalize on world attention was shattered.  A week later, during the very next session, Hey Bulldog, he brought into the studio for the very first time his new partner, Yoko.  There were plenty of songs written in India to fill up most of the white album, and John's sudden disdain for the group venture was not completely evident until that batch was used up.  So here it is, before it mangled by World Wildlife, Phil Spector and finally the naked Paul, John's last shot at global connection in all its shimmering glory.  (68 was a year where a lot of potentially positive things ended up pretty downtrodden.)""Life is very short, and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend.",0
"I have used this book in my classroom many times, from a read-aloud to the class to using it in small groups.  There is some difficult vocabulary, but with help from a teacher or a parent, it is very much worthwhile.  Children can relate to the mischievous, daredevil ways of the characters.  It is both funny and heart-wrenching.  The ending is always a struggle for me to read aloud to them.  It always brings a tear to my eye.

"The value of a book of reprints mined from HBR's rich archive depends on the quality of selection by the miner. This is the best such anthology I have seen, with an excellent introduction which deserves very careful reading. To quote an early paragraph: ""To do things differently, we must learn to see things differently. Seeing differently means learning to question the conceptual lenses through which we view and frame the world, our businesses, our core competencies, our competitive advantage, and our business models... If there is anything actually coming into focus today, it is the realization that we need to question much of what we think we know about how to conduct commerce, including marketing, distribution, service and the notion of competition itself. Hardest of all, we need to be able to think about changing the architecture of our revenue streams, that is, the way we make money.""Also in the introduction, the author/editor introduces a powerful framework for thinking about innovation opportunities, which he calls QTL4, or Quality through Linking to the world; Listening through those linkages; Learning and reflecting through those listenings; and then Leading. He has applied this framework to selection of the articles for the book. The opening article is W. Brian Arthur's Increasing Returns and the New World of Business. It challenges one of the most fundamental tenets of classical economics, 'the assumption of diminishing returns: products or companies that get ahead in a market eventually run into limitations, so that a predictable equilibrium of prices and market shares is reached'. He argues that while this still applies in large measure to the bulk-processing economy, increasing returns, 'the tendency for that which is ahead to get further ahead, for that which loses advantage to lose further advantage' tends to reign in the newer part of the economy, the knowledge-based industries. This has enormous implications for business practice and for national policy. The two worlds of bulk processing and knowledge have different economics, operating side by side. The article works through the implications of operating in the different economies and for those organisations that have to operate simultaneously in both. It is hugely important that not only business people but also politicians and national policy makers understand its implications",1
"The Essential Connie Smith&quot; is accurately titled.  Connie had 39 Billboard hits from 1964-1978.  After that, country music went off the deep end. This CD captures 19 of her best, or at least most commercially successful, releases. With the exception of one Gospel track, all achieved Top 20 status on the charts. They include her version of standards as Gordon Lightfoot's &quot;Ribbon of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Cry, Cry, Cry&quot;.  High points are &quot;The Hurtin's All Over&quot;, &quot;Run Away Little Tears&quot; and especially a pleading &quot;Just For What I Am&quot;. Every male in a relationship with a female should listen to that one!  When this woman pleads, I listen! In her distinctively strong, enthusiastic yet thoroughly feminine voice, I imagined that Connie was singing to me-one on one. I would urge country fans unfamiliar with Connie to try this CD. I have tracks by Tammy, Dottie West, Brenda Lee and Skeeter Davis. While I love those ladies, Connie tops them all. Bottom line: There is just something about this woman and her music",0
"Vancouver: Secrets of  the City is a thoroughly researched and enjoyable read that may stand as a proto-type of sorts in guide books for curious locals and tourists alike. It includes an impressive array of facts, tips,  and social history as well as sections on Vancouver's art and literary  worlds, its gathering places, festivals, accommodations, dinning,  nightlife, shopping, transportation and of course its notoriety. Best of  all, the mix is achieved with a rare and stylish flare for visual and  textual interplay",1
"This is my favorite Nawang cd.  Tibetan flute and Australian didgeridoo.  Nawang was a Tibetan monk who eventually fled to Australia to evade the Chinese annexation.  Though renouncing monkhood he is still very much  involved in his spirituality and this shows in his music.  I have never  heard a single instrument played to such effect.  Peace is the main theme  of all his work but this is not passivity, this is not the sleep of  unconsciousness.  This is a dynamic peace, one which engages all the  varieties of life yet never gets bogged down by them.  There is power here,   power of the wisdom of Earth and the compassion of Buddha.  The music  brings the spirit of the listener to the portals of Shambhala, to the heart  of Tibet, and to the center of the adamantine throne on which sits the  Buddha.  Of course we are all really Buddha deep inside, so when we come to  the center of the throne we come to the center of ourselves.  Listen to  this disk and you will hear what I mean.  One reviewer mentioned that it is  only good for sleep.  I do like to listen to peaceful music when I go to  sleep, but I can never do that with Nawang.  The music floats, to borrow a  phrase from Hildegard von Bingen, like a feather on the breath of oneness.   What could be more exciting than that?  But to each his own.  We hear as we  are able, and should one hear what another does not is that to mean one is  wrong and the other right?  No.  Each is in his own place, and each hears  what is right for him.  For me, you cannot get much more right than Nawang  Khechog",0

"Speaking not as a math specialist but one disposed to read a number of the popular explications of Godel's famous proof I can say that it was Godel's original text that did it for me. The reason is that it is the proof and not a lot of verbiage about the proof. And it is short and sweet. One problem is that the more common Turing Machine approach is actually 'easier', where Godel's approach is that of recursive functions which are more obscure, or at least less often discussed. If you can sort of glare at the recursive function issue and proceed with the basics of the proof it will stand out suddenly better than many of the popularizations. At least give it a try",1
"This is bringing back loads of memories for me.  I remember when the movie came out and I remember the first time I heard the soundtrack some 8 years ago and being blown away by it.  Ah, college dayz!  The movie had a sexy vibe to it and there was definitely good chemistry with Nia Long and Larenz Tate.  And hey, these were the times when Bill Bellamy was popular!  The CD starts out with a Tate's poem from the movie, lyrically 'impressing' Nia Long's character.  But then it's followed up with one of my favorite songs that to me captures how you feel when despite how hard you try, you fall in love - ""Hopeless"".  The music, the words, the arrangement is great in it's simplicity.   That cut's followed up with Lauryn Hill's ""Sweetest Thing"", which is nostalgic to me because it was before her wildly popular solo debut album would come out in 1998.  Remember Xscape?  Well they feature here with ""In the Rain"", a decent enough track but not the strongest of highlights for the album.  Other than ""Hopeless"", that title is reserved for ""Inside My Love"" and ""You Move Me"".  ""Inside My Love"" is redone off of the old Minnie Ripperton version from the mid seventies, and IMO Trina Broussard did a very good job with it.  But still Minnie's version sends chills up and down my spine.  Meanwhile Cassandra Wilson's ""You Move Me"" features her rich, deep voice with a soulful smooth and slow snap.  The CD winds out with a poem recited by Nia Long from the movie, but that is preceeded by one of Coltrane's best ""In a Sentimental Mood"", which fits the full atmosphere of the film.I definitely recommend this CD.  8 years later it's stood the test of time.  It shows how beautiful music can come together if the general sense of a soundtrack and compilation fit.  The vibe of the album is a bit darker, but also very sensual and romantic and it's music that you can feel.  Being that a theme of the movie was expression and deepness in words, no doubt that was transferred into this very deep cd.  I wouldn't put this in if you're looking to snap out of a bad mood or being down.  But... it's perfect for those times when you are on the cusp of either euphoria or heart-ache. ",0

"For those with an interest in learning what the law is all about, this is a really great place to start.  As others have mentioned, it will be an excellent choice for those who are contemplating law school or paralegal studies.  The author does a great job of condensing important information on a variety of different areas within the law, and making them interesting by putting the material into context with everyday life.

"Very good coverage of tube welding , motorcycle/bicycle/aeroplane type tubing including some on vacuum  chamber  welding  titanium.  Not much coverage of stick welding , It does say stick welding has been obsolete for aircraft  welding  since MIG  and TIG processes were invented in 1955  and 1945  respectively.   I consider  it  the  most  valuable  welding  book I  have  ever seen, and I've  read    lots.  If you are a  beginner  and  you just  want  too  piddle  around and  make  a  trailer  frame  or  the  equivilant  don't  buy  It.    If  you  actually  want  to  make front suspension  A  arms   for  a  car  from  4130   tubing  for  200  mph   use   buy  it. If  you  actually  are  wanting  to   build  an  airplane  frame  or  a serious motorcycle   frame   buy  it.    It  mostly   covers  MIG   and  TIG  somewhat  equally possibly  leaning  towards  TIG   ,  and  it  repeatadly   points  TIG's  superior  welds .  One  has   to  be  a  really  really   good  MIG   welder   to  even  think   of  equalling  what   can  be   fairly  easily   done   with  TIG.   If  you  want  information  on  stick  welding   don't   buy  it.  There  is lots  of  stick  welding   being  currently   on   structural  projects  bridges  and  skyscraper  building frames.  More   tons  of   bead  d eposited  every   year   with  stick than  any  other   process,  but. . . this  is   because   MIG   doesn't  work  well   where   air   currents   blow  the   gas   jacket   away.  Stick   is  largely  irelivant   for   motorsports  and  aircraft  welding.",1
"Not wanting to upset the balance of the universe, I was a good Nikon user and used only the brands/types of CF memory cards the manufacturer recommended, thinking that stepping an inch off this list meant stepping off the edge of the world. But seeing the price of the cards on this list, and running the risk of getting one of those infamous counterfeits on eBay, put me in a quandry: I needed more memory (who doesn't?) but I didn't have the money (who does?). I decided to risk the unthinkable and looked beyond 'the list'.I did an open-ended 'net search on price vs. features in a CF card, sat back, and let the web do my walking. The best combination was the Transcend line, which I had never heard of. I narrowed my next search to the brand, and learned that this company had been making memory modules for a wide variety of applications for years, and had engineered a product capable of working under extended temperatures and other environmental conditions. Their reputation among industry professionals was golden.So I figured what's the worst that can happen? Would putting one of their CF cards in my camera leave me with a pile of D70 ashes? I closed my eyes, gritted my teeth, rolled the dice and hit a 7: no compatibility issues, excellent performance, and lots of pretty pictures. (And my camera is still in one piece.)I took over a thousand pictures in three days (Arnold Classic) on that chip. Every one of them recorded and transferred flawlessly.Methinks Nikon needs to update their list",0

"Echoing so many other rave reviews, I have to say this is one of the most exciting cookbooks I've hefted (and it is hefty!) in a long time. It seems like nearly everything that I've eaten in Italy or seen on an Italian menu or read in another Italian cookbook has a straightforward, canonical recipe in this tome. It was like discovery, uncovering secrets again and again. I was breathless turning pages in my favorites sections, and kept returning to the book for days, unable to pull myself away.One feature that continued to grab me was the stunning, paradoxical simplicity of these recipes. On the one hand, the dishes themselves have the admirable directness of the most memorable meals in Italy -- made from a handful of ingredients prepared without fuss. One or two flavors against a shallow backdrop. For instance, reading a recipe in The Silver Spoon, I think: ""Well, of course! Braised savoy cabbage with buckwheat pasta! And of course, it needs so little to go with it -- a little garlic, onion, some chopped sage, salt and pepper. Buono appetit!"" Again and again, page after page of recipes with like five or eight ingredients, showcasing the simple, delicate plate so often presented in Italy, whatever the focus. On the other hand, the recipe text itself is also simple. As other reviewers have noted, this is not a beginner's cookbook. For instance, it may say ""Your going to take this fish, and bake it with these herbs and capers, and pour over it this sauce."" But it will *not* say ""Here's how you prepare a fish filet. Here's how you bake it, and how to tell when it is done. This is the emulsification that you want when you whisk together the sauce ingredients. Etc."" You're expected to already have that experience. Another example: I've made a good bit of fresh pasta, egg-based or oil, with a machine roller or rolled with a pin by hand. With this background, the directions for all of the wonderful fresh pasta variations in this book made sense to me and were clear. But they were simple, short, and matter of fact -- way less than the pages that other cookbooks devote to preparing the dough, and the silky feel of the rolled dough when it's ready, and resting under towels before cutting, etc.So I wonder what it'll be like when I try a simple, matter of fact recipe for something I haven't already made a lot, like a gnocchi, from this cookbook. In truth, I'm not too worried, because I already have other cookbooks that say how hard it is to make good gnocchi and explain techniques at length. This cookbook, in contrast, merely says ""You know, there are 20 scrumptious traditional variations of gnocchi, including polenta, pumpkin, rice, cheese, and more -- and here's their straightforward recipes."" I love that!Maybe the editors assumed that someone growing up in a home with an Italian kitchen has already seen fresh pasta or gnocchi made, and just needs the recipes for all the variations. Like an American cookbook can say ""boil an egg"" without further directions. So this cookbook, though encyclopedic in it's recipes, is not -- as other reviewers have said -- encyclopedically instructional in how to cook them, like Joy of Cooking, Beard's American Cookery, or Bittman's How to Cook Everything all are.And that's just fine.The Silver Spoon, in this way that it is thrillingly evocative while not being deeply instructional, reminds me most of Alice Waters' cookbooks -- where she will sometimes just list ingredients without amounts, and describe how to cook them together without times; e.g. olive oil and quartered fennel bulb and chili and fennel seed, braised long and slow. The Silver Spoon does list amounts and times. Maybe it's a reflection of Italian cuisine itself that everything seems so simply stated. It comes across as confident, for the confident chef, who will enjoy this book the most",1

"Wow....  Of all the books and theories I've read about politics and society, none compare to ""Which Way Western Man?"".  It's difficult finding truth in our information age with so many books and ""analysts"" all running in different directions.  I suppose the best anyone can do is use their judgement and experience and decide what ""truth"" is for themselves.  As for myself, I was completely blown away by William Simpson's views.  I couldn't help but agree with him.  His views on Jesus, women, race, and ""the machine"" couldn't be said better.  The very next day after reading about ""the machine"", I went to work and everything he said just jumped right out at me.  In fact the more I go about my daily life, the more I laugh to myself and think about how right he was.But I warn you, ignorance is bliss and this book isn't for everyone.  If you're a reality denier, don't even bother.  It shakes the very foundations of everything you believe and everything we are taught is ""right"" like equality for example. Both as individuals and races, it is a biological fact of life that we are all UNEQUAL.  We are not equal in intelligence, in character, or potential.  You could get the data that supports this by reading something like ""The Bell Curve"" but you don't have to go any further then your workplace to see it. Sometimes the truth hurts.  If you are someone who really does care about the state of the world, this book will make you very angry, or very depressed, or a little of both because it shows us how really sick we have become. And I have never questioned myself as much as I did when I finished.  Someone who is more or less weak will not be happy thinking about how far they have it in them to go.Thank you for creating such an amazing book Mr. Simpson. ",1

"This has got to be one of the best sitcoms I have ever had the pleasure to watch.  I was a Kids in the Hall fan, and truly wondered how Dave Foley would fare in this one when it began, and I must admit he took it and ran.  The writers are ingenious and the actors chemistry together is amazing.  Whoever is responsible for casting this show needs a star on the Hollywood walk of fame",0
"The Heart of the Last Self-Help Book is this -- Pearsall cites scientific evidence to challenge what he calls the McMorals of self-potentialism: the unsubstantiated prescriptions, programs, guarantees, and gurus that define our pursuit of The Good Life. Therefore this book becomes the newest contribution to the Realistic Psychology Movement, in contrast to the superficial be happy-ism of the Positive Psychology Movement. Possibly the best Realistic Psychology book (for real people) since The Positive Power of Negative Thinking. Beyond psychology, the more philosophically inclined might add The Myth of Sisyphus. Recommended for demonstrating that psychologists can be realistic.",1
"The somber cover, the title, and the reference to prison abuses at the opening of this book are a little misleading. This memoir is not especially dark or grim, and the journey it recounts is an internal one, more from the land of ""yes"" than ""no."" It captures that particular youthful optimism that buoys up children and adolescents in the worst of times. And the Islamic revolution in Iran becomes the worst of times for the community of 100,000 Jews living in Tehran in the late 1970s, as the monarchy is toppled and the Ayatollah Khomeini returns from exile to assume power.Hakakian's book is a vividly and wonderfully remembered account of her coming of age in these tumultuous years. The equally gifted younger sister of three precocious brothers, an admitted ""class clown,"" she happily plays her own growing self-confidence and self-awareness against the reader's knowledge of coming events. Through her, we experience the almost universal public euphoria that followed the fall of the Shah, and while she chooses to discount its significance, we see mounting evidence of the approaching political and social forces that will finally drive her family to join the Jewish exodus from Iran. This is a fine, well-written book, often entertaining and sometimes starkly moving. The parallels Hakakian draws to Orwell's ""1984"" illustrate the gradual erosion of self that occurs when the state attempts to control individuals' thoughts and desires. In this and other ways, it's an excellent companion to Nafisi's ""Reading Lolita in Tehran.",1

"Erwitt's fine body of work is cleanly reproduced here and loosley arranged by subject matter. The work is allowed space to breathe and speak for itself, as there are very few textual interruptions. Erwitt's signature visual humour, evidence of the decisive moment, and the universality of humankind are all well represented. The full-size reproductions are rich with detail, sumptuous tones and precise grain. This is an excellent addition to any library of photography or coffee table, as well as an excellent introduction to the finest work of one of the world's great photographers",1

"I purchased this somewhat expecting a campy but spooky background music CD.  I was really hoping that I would not be bombarded with new age synth music and cheesy effects.  I wasn't.There is nothing cheap or cheesy here. This recording is an integrated sound experience which can set a dark atmosphere very appropriate for haunted houses or halloween get togethers.However, it also stands well on its own as a listening experience. It seems well constructed from beginning to end and actually does tell a story in sound. If you are looking for a good halloween CD which holds its own weight and provides a beautiful experience, this is a good choice",0

Havana USA is a very thorough account of post-revolutionary Cuban migration to America. One of the interesting aspects of Cuban emigration since Castro has been the perspectives given to us by the media and the government - many of them misleading. Garcia dispels these myths with facts  backed up my extensive research and personal interviews. A very interesting  read,1

"This is Mill's statement of the ' one very simple principle' he wished to establish in ' On Liberty'  "" The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion or control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. The principle is that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively , in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do, or forebear because it will be better for him to do,because it will make him happier, because , in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise or even right... The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society,is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself , his idnependence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign. This is in a nutshell the creed of Mill's faith in ' On Liberty ' Gertrude Himmelfarb in her brilliant introduction explains how that faith developed in part out of the personal situation in which Mill found himself after years of close friendship with the - then married Harriet Taylor after her husband died, became his wife. One great controversy relates to the vast credit Mill gave her with being a full partner in every way in creating this work. The social isolation both suffered as a result of their relationship is an important element in Mill's fierce defence of the individual's right to be free of social coercion, and opinion. Another central element in the development of Mill's thought is his reaction to the Utilitarianism his father John Mill and Jeremy Bentham instilled in Mill from childhood. 'The greatest happiness for the greatest number principal' is rejected by Mill as first basis for social action. Mill in effect says that it is not society's business to be a Grand Inquisitor and bring it bread and circuses to make it happy. Happiness is not the first principle any longer in Mill's thought rather individual liberty is. The sole curb on such individual liberty is when it leads to the harming of others. This faith of Mill can be recognized today as part and parcel of the fundamental ideology of democratic societies. This work is thus one of the fundamental political classics which form the Western political tradition. And it is one of those works which should be part of the curriculum of any true liberal arts education. The question of the excesses of this principle and whether Mill in his thought has provided sufficient check to it by consideration of other human values isa very real and debatable one even today.

"Having purchased Louis Griffel's &quot;Painting the Impressionist Landscape,&quot; which illustrates Hawthorne's way of &quot;seeing things&quot;, I was delighted to find this little gem which compiled Hawthorne's comments on painting. This small volume is packed full of wisdom. One can imagine sitting with Hawthorne as he describes the various paintings, their good and bad points. There are no illustrations in &quot;Hawthorne on Painting&quot; but Griffel's book provides ample opportunity to see what he was saying. The two together provide a wonderful look into Cape Cod Impressionism. Hawthorne models with paint instead of drawing with it on the canvas. Form is achieved through proper color value placed side by side. The book is truly inspiring for any painter",1

"The music in this album is absolutely gorgeous.  Usually, I'm not happy with attempts to mix nature and music, but this album breaks my stereotypes!  Natural sounds are blended with human instruments to create an auditory setting that quickly and gently pulls you into a meditative state.  My taiji/qigong instructor uses this music in her classes and I fell in love with it the minute I heard it -- and I wasn't alone.  If you're looking for music to perform taiji, qigong, yoga, or just for meditation, this album is a must",0

"Whether you happen to know the how's and why's of Christana Rossetti's life and time, her poetry, and especially Goblin Market, is truely amazing. Of course knowing her circumstanses only makes the joy and fascination even bigger for a comtemporary reader.

She is the original  Girl Power if ever there was such a thing and Goblin Market a legacy of its  time",1

However, I did not know the tricks, shortcuts and I could not take adventage of the features of Eclipse fully until I started reading &quot;Eclipse in Action&quot;.

Probably the authors did not want to increase the volume of the book. All in all, it is a great book!..",1
"As a history buff, this one really got me...AND I HATE BOXING! It's so much more than a book about two boxers; Mr Margolick has written of a time, circumstance, the people and the events which were, at least, peripherally involved in the run-up to the outbreak of WW II. He has, quite literally, placed us in the 30's and we become party to the tension, grief, politics, intrigues,  and triumph which surround the two men.A GREAT READ if you like history, the 30's, politics, people, and, of course, boxing. This really is a portrait of a time, and an enjoyable, fast read",1
"A series originally pitched by using recycled Sealab 2020 footage that ex-Cartoon Network employees had absconded with in the mid 90s, 2021 is painfully FUNNY and gleefully subversive on many levels.It has several elements that when mixed with care, almost always equal quality television.  Chief among those would be the superb writing which really evokes a sense that the characters don't just know their boundaries... they deliberately explode them on a regular basis, for fun and for profit.  The results rarely fall short of the high water mark set by the first episode ""I Robot.""Having these episodes on DVD, especially with the Play All option is a great way to revisit the madness of this debut season.  Having it completely uncensored would have been nice, but as is illustrated by the alternate, less bleeped out ending of Radio Free Sealab, sometimes the bleeping makes it funnier.The other extra features are brief but fun to watch, even the Pitch Pilot which is not NEARLY as funny as the actual show, but the creators acknowledge this copiously which is in fitting with the overall feeling of the universe created by the writers and the cast.  In fact the voice cast pretty much MAKES this entire show.  Especially Harry Goz as ""Hank"" Murphy.  The timbre, the cadence, the delivery... all perfect and consistently laugh-out-loud funny.  He upstages Erik Estrada and the rest of the stellar crew regularly, but every character (seriously) is a winner and brings something to the overall ridiculous mix of surreal retro-twisted animated entertainment.The case is nicely designed and sturdy, especially for the value of this set.  Clear slip case with a tri-fold, illustrated box.  Cool presentation.Sealab 2021 is certainly not for everyone, but if you find this even remotely funny:------------------------------------------Captain Murphy: Until we find the thief, I am declaring Martian law! Sparks: Um, I think its martial law. Captain Murphy: Silence! Under Martian law... uh... what are my powers, exactly? Sparks: Under martial law, you could suspend habeas corpus, empower a posse comitatus... Captain Murphy: That's crap. Mars is wild, untamed. I'm forming a cadre of Martian knights charged with enforcing Martian law. ------------------------------------------Then you'll probably like this show",0
One of the finest albums of all time.  I patiently await the release of their next album next year,0
"I've always been a fan of Incognito and its lead singer, Baltimore's own Maysa Leak.  Her solo debut was a fine CD, but her 2000 effort, ""All My Life"" raises the bar even higher.  It's such a shame that she isn't getting more attention, because she's certainly one of the finest soul singers around.  Here, the disc seamlessly blends jazz, r&b, and soulful house, all of which are set to Maysa's sultry voice which exudes an effortless grace.  Those who are familiar with Incognito's work will find plenty to savor here.  From the positive vibe of the opener, ""Got to Be Strong,"" I was hooked.  The album is surprisingly consistent, with no filler tracks or lackluster tunes.  In addition to ""Got to Be Strong,"" my favorites are the jazzed-up ""Mirrors,"" the anti-drinking message of ""The Bottle,"" ""Earth Child,"" and the flat out beautiful title track.  The production has a stern ear for detail, capturing the right balance of sax, percussion, guitars, and bass. There are other soul records that may sell more, but you'll find few that are as exceptionally classy as ""All My Life.""  Grade: A-",0
"It's difficult to talk about Chris Thile and not think back to the Chicago Tribune concert review that called him ""A force of nature with a flatpick; To say Thile is as staggering a talent as has ever come out of bluegrass would be too limiting--few have emerged from any genre that compare with Thile's brilliance."" I couldn't agree more.  There are scant geniuses walking the earth today who can even approach Chris Thile's combination of ""gift"" and work ethic.  He could have stopped when he was 12 and still be thought of as the world's pre-eminent mandolinist for the remainder of his life.  Lucky for us, he didn't stop.For this project Chris gathered other musicians who are undisputed masters of their instruments: Bela Fleck on banjo.  Jerry Douglas on Dobro.  Bryan Sutton on guitar.  Stuart Duncan on fiddle.  Edgar Meyer on bass.  At the moment I can't imagine a collection of string musicians with more virtuosity.  They get turned loose on 12 of Chris' original compositions.  The results are spectacular.  All instrumentals - this collection covers a wide range of material.  Some hot and spicy bluegrass breakdowns.  Some slower pieces.  All good.  Get it",0
"I was so excited to get the time tracker and am now so frustrated with it. The first one that I got did not work at all...they sent a second one and this one worked for less than 5 minutes (we tried 3 different sets of new batteries).

"I am one of the lucky ones in that I was introduced to furniture quality by my Home Economic teacher 35 years ago.  Unfortunately, I have watched friends and relatives repeatedly replace furniture because they only bought on looks and could not tell the difference between a $700 leather sofa and a $3500 one.  This book is great!  It tells new consumers what to look for and what they are paying for.  The illustrations are great and the terminology is easy to understand.  Mr. Lewin does not suggest that you buy only top of the line furniture; he urges you to consider the purpose and the abuse/use a piece of furniture will take. Furniture shopping to me is like looking in a museum.  Although I knew a lot, I still found things to highlight in his book.  I plan on buying this book for Christmas, wedding and graduation gifts",1
"This was the first book that introduced me to the works of Pauline Gedge back when I was a freshman in college in 1980. I have read absolutely everything that Pauline Gedge has written since, and it is all nothing less than incredible.  I have also read anything and everything that I could get my hands on that was fiction set in ancient Egypt. Everything else pales by comparison.  Gedge, far and away has done impeccable research and has painted the most realistic picture of Ancient Egypt in print.  No one writing fiction set in this period before or since can match the lush, gilded with gold and intense colour that one finds in her books.  &quot;Child of the Morning&quot;, which is about Hatshepsut, is a great read, and a wonderful first novel that established her as a writer. I highly recommend!",1
"This book is very exceptional. Coetzee's literary criticisms are of the highest level. He discusses a very broad range of writers and books, including;  Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe; Samuel Richardson's odd novel Clarissa; Cees Nooteboom's retelling of fairy tales; a critique of William Gass's critique of the poems of Rilke; the difficulty in translating Kafka; the novel The Man Without Qualities by Robert Musil, as well as Musil's Diaries published after his death; the most productive years of Dostoevsky; the essays (as well as career and poems) of Joseph Brodsky; a fantastic summary of the career and work of J.L. Borges; another penetrating essay on the serial works of A. S. Byatt; the novels of Caryl Phillips; the career of Salman Rushdie; a review of Nobel Prize winner Naguib Mahfouz's The Harafish; a fascinating essay on Daphne Rooke; an essay on Nadine Gordimer's advice to South African writers to look to the Russian intellectuals prior to the fall of Nicholas and Alexandria for resonance with current South Africa's dilema; and a wonderful essay on Doris Lessings life and work.  Coetzee is brilliant, I have loved his novels, but his literary critism is some of the most thought provoking essays I have read in years. This book is highly recommended.",1
I like this book for several reasons. It is well organized with all the important information. It also has maps so you can carry it in your car and call ahead.

"Carrie Vaughn's Kitty Norville novels are like crack. I would consider them my guilty of guiltiest reading pleasures because on the surface, the Kitty novels are werewolf stories and who wants to be caught reading a werewolf novel in public? Carrie Vaughn's Kitty Norville novels are not my guilty of guiltiest reading pleasures because they are simply too damn good. I would happily be caught reading Carrie Vaughn in public.Kitty Norville is a werewolf. A lycanthrope. She is also the host of her own midnight radio show where she takes calls about the supernatural. Kitty and the Midnight Hour was our introduction to Kitty and her world. Kitty Goes to Washington revealed the existence of werewolves and the supernatural to America when Kitty was called to testify in front of Congress. She's had threats to her life from her own kind, from vampires, and just from those who fear what she is and what she signifies to these people.Frankly, Kitty is tired. She needs to get away. So, in Kitty Takes a Holiday, Kitty does exactly that. She heads to a remote cabin in the Colorado back country and expects to write her memoirs. Her life so far. No radio show, no outside world. Just quiet and reflection. Trouble follows Kitty, however, and trouble begins with dead animals being left on her porch as some sort of sacrifice. A sick joke? Then, Cormac, the mysterious werewolf hunter and possibly friend of Kitty, shows up carrying her wounded lawyer, Ben. Trouble? To say the least.Carrie Vaughn takes a big risk with Kitty Takes a Holiday because she removes one essential aspect of Kitty's character: the radio show. One incident of this and it isn't a big deal. More than this and Vaughn risks alienating some of her readers who want Kitty to remain the same. In Carrie Vaughn's sure hands, however, there is no danger. Her Kitty Norville is such an interesting character and Vaughn gets across Kitty's doubts about herself and why she could feel such burnout.What Carrie Vaughn succeeds so well with in this novel is introducing new, interesting, and credible threats, advancing what we know (or think we know) about Kitty, Ben, and Cormac, and move Kitty along in life so that Kitty will be in a place where Vaughn can do something very different in the next Kitty novel and still have it feel authentic. Carrie Vaughn succeeds.Kitty Takes a Holiday is a fast paced, exciting novel where the protagonist happens to be a werewolf and the story happens to deal with werewolves, but even with this focus on the supernatural it feels like Carrie Vaughn is doing something fresh with this sub-genre and constantly doing something fresh with her characters. The Kitty novels are consistently compelling and as Vaughn introduces new situations where Kitty must grow as a character the Kitty novels continue to improve. Kitty Takes a Holiday is quite possibly the strongest of the three Kitty novels and shows Carrie Vaughn's growth as a novelist.The most important thing about Carrie Vaughn's Kitty Norville novels is simply that they are fun to read. Kitty Takes a Holiday is a shining example of this and having read the first two books is helpful but by no means essential. The Kitty novels can likely be categorized in several different ways. I call them a pleasure.-Joe Sherr",1
it was a great tribute to the late great dimebag..'nuff said,0
"This is a great book. It is a lot less technical than the Science of Mind textbook. It is comprised of several essays that are all written in a very ""down-to-earth"" style and each essay can probably be read in about 10-15 minutes. Now, just because you read the essay, don't think for a minute that now you know what Ernest Holmes is talking about because it will take you the rest of this life to apply his incredible ideas and magnificent insights. I'm sorry to disillusion you about the spiritual path. The Spiritual path is not a path of words; it is a path of dedicated application and every day presents its opportunities as well as challenges and that is a very good thing.I believe that the Living Spirit of God is everywhere present; that everything I see in the world of form is a creation of the Divine. Now I can say this with relative ease and for the most part I really do feel with all my heart that this is True and in my times of prayer and meditation I really KNOW that this is True and then I blow out the candles, roll up the meditation mat and go out into the world of effect and BAM! Before you know it I am bombarded with the world...Oh, crap...you mean I have to live this spirituality stuff out?All the sudden I am presented with the challenge/the opportunity to live out my ideals or give in to what is right in front of me. Do I judge righteously...in other words use my mind in the ""right"" way and see behind the appearances or do I allow myself to get sucked up in the world of effect. Bare in mind(and heart) that nothing upset God...Heaven is still very present within me but am I willing to rise up in consciousness or am I going to descend into the depths of hell? Hell is any situation where we feel separated from Spirit.Living out your Spiritual Truth is the name of the game. Books, tapes, lectures, classwork, that's all supplemental, but the test is everyday living. Like that old zen saying, ""Before enlightenment chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water."" I'm not saying that I am completely enlightened by any stretch, but I am saying that now that I have been exposed to Spiritual Truths now I have the glorious opportunity to practice them. I can no longer stick my head in the sand and ""pretend"" that I don't know because now on a certain level of things, I do.This book will help you apply your Spirituality in wonderful and beautiful ways. My advice to you would be to take a particular essay and just work with that one essay for a few days or even a week. Underline things that you reasonate with, journal about those ideas, ask yourself how can you apply this in your every day life and then watch your world transform into something new and beautiful. Remember, the Light of God is always present but by purifying our minds, our hearts, and our souls we are coming into a deeper understanding that it is and it has always been and it will always be right where we are.I bless you on your journey and know that all is well",1

"I bought this because it was a good compromise; my husband wanted a rain-shower head, and I wanted the hand-held option.After fining tuning the intallation with teflon tape to stop the massive leak that occurred with installation, this shower head worked like a charm.  However, we have now owned the shower head for 9 months and it is falling apart.  It is cracked on the side and we receive almost no water pressure from the head.  It is made of plastic and is pulling apart.  We have had to tape the handle together to receive any water out of the head.There is a reason this is such a great price - my advice would be to invest a little more and you will not be shopping for a new shower head in 9 months",0
"In our world of dry, specialist scholars, Evelyn Underhill's ""Mysticism..."" shines like a spotlight in a room full of bic lighters. Living at the turn of the century, Underhill writes in a kind of  ""19th century, highly educated yet romantic"" style that has  virtually disappeared in the 20th century. Her knowledge of History and  Christian Theology is encyclopedic and definitely up to the scope her title  suggests. In terms of scholarly achievment, she is a giant.And yet her  skill as an academic is not even close to my favorite thing about this  book. What is? Her prose! Her writing is simply the most beautifully  brilliant I've ever read on the subject. She writes in a way that is not  only poetic, but is also clear and illuminating. Here's an example from  page 252: ""It must never be forgotten that all apparently one-sided  descriptions of Illumination-more, all experiences of it-are governed by  temperment. 'That Light whose smile kindles the Universe' is ever the same;  but the self through whom it passes, and by whom we must receive its  reports, has already submitted to the moulding influences of environment  and heredity, Church and State. The very language of which that self avails  itself in its struggle for expression, links it with half a hundred  philosophies and creeds.""A treasure for anyone looking for  inspiring text, but who's tired of the overly sentimental and often  non-discerning ""new age"" drivel of our time, and a must for any  serious student of the subject",1
"Yes, this is one weird movie. Mass murder has broken out in New York City like a particularly bad flu epidemic. The film opens with a guy perched on a water tower, gunning down pedestrians for no apparent reason. Tony Lo Bianco is a cop named Nicholas who climbs the tower to talk to the man. When asked why he did it, the gunman says, &quot;God told me to.&quot; He then takes a swan-dive onto the street below. Nicholas is a very religious man and is fascinated with the idea of God telling anyone to commit mass murder. The murders keep happening. A man goes to the market and stabs a bunch of customers. Andy Kaufman is a cop who goes berserk at the St. Patrick's Day parade and shoots cops and bystanders alike. Another guy kills his entire family and calmly waits for the police. Of course there's one common denominator in all of these incidents. God told them to do it. Nicholas digs deeper into the mystery to the point of losing his job. He seeks out a young man with long blonde hair who was seen with all the killers just before their crimes. He finds the blonde man's mother, who promptly tries to kill him. Later, Nicholas is told by an older, retired officer about a strange occurance back in 1951. A woman he picked up (running naked down the road) told him she'd been abducted by aliens and raped. Nicholas finds her, still living, in a nursing home. What dark secrets does she hold? What connection is there between Nicholas and the blonde haired man? GOD TOLD ME TO is a VERY different movie! Is God really orchestrating these killings? Or is some alien hybrid only impersonating the deity? Check this one out..",0
"I bought this book in part because I believed it would be the game programming equivalent of the famous Gang of Four ""Design Patterns"" book. This is nowhere near the case; nowhere in this book is there any mention of how games might actually be structured or organized at the code or object level. Patterns in Game Design is nothing more than a dictionary of features appearing in games.Examples are ""patterns"" such as 'Identification' which is basically defined as players identifying with aspects of the game.Games can have ""Alliances"" or the potential for ""Betrayal"" and the authors do not say much more than any common sense person could deduce about such features in a game.Anyone with even a modicum of experience in the gaming world has no real use for this list of game-possible-features. These possibilities are understood implicitly by anyone who has ever played even a small number of modern computer games.At best this book might galvanize the imaginations of someone who has no idea what their game should do",1
"Having just finished Lawerence James' &quot;Rise and Fall of the British Empire&quot;, I felt like sticking with the Brits for a while, and picked up this great little book.  Farwell's style is excellent and his humorous  little anecdotes about life in the Victorian/Edwardian British Army make  for fascinating reading.  Not really a history book it covers the  &quot;sociology&quot; of the British Army of the late 1800s-early 1900s.   It was a stratified society, with gentleman officers and &quot;other  ranks&quot; drawn from people who weren't so well bred.  Not for the  politically correct, though",1

"Plainly put, this book was a ride. Standing back from a distance and looking at what the author has done really can put you in awe - the sheer scope of this work is breathtaking. He digs into many different scientific, mathematical, and artistic disciplines, and somehow manages to work them all together into a sometimes confusing, but ultimately satisfying whole.The short dialogues that fit in between each chapter are clever and always thought-provoking, but the bulk of this book's worth comes in the chapters. From the beginning to the end, I constantly found myself having to stop and rethink my perspective on many subjects. As the end of the book nears, he wraps it up by theorizing profoundly on the then-blooming subject of artificial intelligence. While parts of this are dated by this point, much of it isn't, and that is a testament to Hofstadter's powerful intellect and foresight.As you may have guessed from my review's title, this is not a summer beach read. Admittedly I am not the world's fastest reader, but this one took me a few months to complete (I would often put it down for a stretch and pick it up again some time later). So take your time with this one - enjoy it, reread passages you didn't understand the first time, and maybe pick up a different, easier book when you feel bogged down. But for anyone with any interest in mathematics, computer science, or the philosophy of the human mind, this is a must-have and well worth all the time you can give it",1
"I am a George Smiley fan, and really enjoyed the second novel in his fight with his Russian counterpart, ""Karla.""  I love to be ""kept in the dark"" and fed a little at a time by le Carre, as Smiley does with Peter Guilliam.  You have a sense that Smiley has formulated his opinion of what is happening, long before the proof is actually revealed",1
This was my first knotting book and I found it very easy to understand. It also explains how to begin and end in very clean ways that other books don't usually show you. Also shows you how to add filler or knotter cords when they start to get short. I particularly enjoyed the phishbone pattern. Very pretty and easy to do projects that look alot more complicated. There's lots of techniques here that you can use and expand on. The writting is not dry like a usual instruction book either. It's personable and fun!,1
"I read this book in one sitting; it was so riveting that I could not put it down.  The book covers a variety of events during World War II but the main focus is on Dachau and its liberation by the 45th Thunderbird Division of the Seventh Army. New information about the liberation of Dachau debunks some of the previously published accounts and describes the heroism of the Thunderbird Division.  At a time when Holocaust denial is rampant, this book tells the true story of the atrocities committed at Dachau. The author based his book on eye-witness accounts by American soldiers. There are also old black and white photos, never before published. This book should be required reading in every school in America.",1

"Another great purchase on amazon, which I received today in the mail. Waited quite a while before deciding to get it. I went on the Official Eurythmics Website and saw the video. After that, I knew I had to buy the single & help support Annie & Dave. ""IGAL"" has to be among my top 3 fave Eurythmics songs to date. To be honest, this is a top 5 list of my fave Eurytmics songs (from least fave to fave):- Miracle of Love- Come Together- Beethoven (I love to listen to)- I've got a life- 17 Again""IGAL"" is a very powerful song, showcasing Annie's powerful & stunning vocals. God, the woman can sure belt out a song! Find me a women in music at Annie's age with this much class & lung capacity. Pretty difficult, huh? Annie & Dave look & sound mighty fine and they've followed with the modern sound right up until the present. Seeing them dressed in the same suits as back in the 80's on ""Touch"" is fab. They are the most remarkable pop duo of alltime and I love it! No wonder they've been accepted into the UK Hall of Fame.Tracklisting:01- I've got a life - 4:0602- I've got a life (Sander Kleinenberg's You're it MIX) - 7:3503- Sweet Dreams (Are made of this) - Remastered - 3:3704- I've got a life (Video) - 4:06Info:- Made in England- 2005 SONY BMG MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT UK LTD- www.eurythmics.com- Disc is white with red & gray title- Track titles & total minutes per song written on disc- Slimline jewel-case- Front image is black & white, compared to ""Part 1"" being in colorMoving on, it's time to talk about the songs. ""IGAL"" is bouncy, rich in sound and so modern, compared to ""Sweet Dreams"" or any of the earlier hits. It's incredible how one song can showcase such an evolution in a duo's career. This song can make it on it's own in the clubs & bars, without being remixed. I think Annie's voice alone sells the song. The Sander Kleinenberg's Mix is pretty darned good too...although the Guetta & Garraud is better. Both should be and most probably are found in the clubs all across the country by now. I don't care much for ""Sweet Dreams"" as a song. Never did anything for me then and it doesn't now...although it's remastered. Have heard it so many times, I just don't see the difference in the original & remastered sound.The video for ""IGAL"" is beautiful and sold me right away. Thanks Annie & Dave, for putting on such a great video. I can watch this video in the comfort of my own home without feeling like I'm robbing the artist of their money. Go & get a copy of this for yourself. You won't regret it",0

"I am not really a huge Journey fan. They are an extremely gifted group of artists and clearly have a distinctive style, but they are Dom Perignon to my Rumpleminze music palate.This may sound like a strange review, but, in a nutshell, I believe that this is the album Journey created when they were at their creative apex. I only like 2 Journey songs and truthfully can maybe get through 2 other Journey songs without hitting the eject button. I gladly say that mega-hit track 6 ""Wheel In The Sky"" really is one of my all-time favorite anthems. IMO the overlooked classic is {track 2 ""Feeling That Way""/track 3 ""Anytime"".} I am aware that, technically, the bracketed item is 2 separate tracks but listening to track 2 without fading directly into track 3 is the musical equivalent of ""the bachelor party without the obligatory strip-club dance angel.""Journey is one of those bands that you either really like or really dislike. Journey songs tend to give me a headache (or maybe it was the Rumpleminze) but ""Wheel In The Sky"" and ""Feeling That Way/Anytime"" are 2 songs that really make me feel good, anytime.      ",0

"I'm just going to add to what others have already said.  First, some people are complaining that Petrucci only played two songs in his solo set, whereas the others played three.  Well maybe if these guys could count past three, they'd realize that Petrucci's set was around 18 minutes long, Vai's was around 20, and Satch's was around 21.  Besides, if you want to see more of John, you could always buy a Dream Theater DVD.   As far as Joe's choice of songs on the disc, it should be obvious... he included ""Up in Flames"" and ""Searching"" because they were two of the best songs on the album, ""Is There Love in Space"" (which was his most recent album at the time).  He also included ""War"", an older song that was not as big of a hit as some others.  I'm sure he played quite a few other songs, as there's no way he'd travel all the way to Japan to play for 20 minutes.  My guess is that those songs had to be cut out of the DVD in order to stuff the whole concert onto a single DVD.  Besides, they were probably already featured on the ""Live in SF"" DVD or the other two G3 DVDs.  Conclusion: if you appreciate the electric guitar, buy this DVD.  Don't tell me you can't afford it.  It costs less than a single movie ticket",0

"Window Seat: The Art of Digital Photography & Creative Thinking is a photo documentary of a business trip taken by Julieanne Kost from the window seat of the airplane as she shares her personal innermost thoughts,, fears, triumphs, weaknesses and her passion for photography.This book isn't a how-to on digital photography or Photoshop, as the title may lead you to think, but it will stand out among photography books for the shear brilliance of photography within its pages.The first section,The Art of Creative Thinking, describes just that. With Kost's 18 point perspective, she explains how she works and helps open one's mind to the tools, goals, progression, and success one can obtain with the medium of photography through exploration, discipline and control.The center section, Window Seat, is her portfolio of airplane window seat photography. It is filled with nearly 80 pages of creativity. She captures each subject perfectly and though does not explain the digital or Photoshop process she uses, she shares a sequence of images and why they were chosen for the book.I see color palettes and gradients. I tried once to convey perceptions of time, starting with dawn--cold, crisp, gently, awakening--moving into daytime--bright mountains, green farmland, blue water glistening, light performing a circus act through 15,000 feet of cloud layers--and finishing with sunset--a perfect gradient of white, yellow, orange, red, purple, blue, deep blue, even deeper blue, and the darkest black you can imagine. This is almost like covering an entire day, but it doesn't work if you leave one place, fly for 14 hours, and arrive the same day somewhere else just two hours later. (Maybe I've just discovered another wrinkle: our assumptions about time expressed through the concepts of morning, day, and night.) (pg. 81) The Appendix is where Kost shares how she uses some of the digital photography tools and which she likes best. This section gives a broad view of imaging techniques.If you're looking for a how-to book on digital photography or Photoshop, Window Seat is not for you. But if you're looking for a fascinating concept of images, insight into streamlining your digital sight, and letting your imagination run, then, Kost's book will do exactly what she wanted.The photograph, on page 90 and 91 that adorns this small passage below is a brilliant picture of earth and sky mixed.. . . I wanted to walk out on the wing of the plane to look all around. (pg.91) At a quick glance, to this reader, it looks like an image of a human heart and arteries. That pretty much explains my feelings of Window Seat: Kost has taken to heart her love of photography and used every artery available to produce a book that will not only open an artist's eyes to the beauty of photography, but will also give that artist a taste of what it's like to capture what no one else sees.",1
"This play is a very profound character study of a quite extra-ordinary woman.  Hedda Gabler is an anti-heroine.  She is a woman with strong ideals who has failed to find her way in the world.  What an actress is required to play this complex part!  I'm not sure who could handle the part right now, but I couldn't help but imagine Bette Davis in it.  She would have been able to handle the complexity of this woman whose ideals for a perfect life were so unattainable, and who could not bear to live if those ideals couldn't be met.  Hedda found that she couldn't manipulate everyone around her in order to achieve her goals either, so she put a bullet through her head because it all seemed so futile to her.  This play is a definite characterization play, and so is different than a lot of  Ibsen's other plays which were social-problem plays",1

"I lift about 3 times a week.  This is my second pair of Harbinger gloves.  The last pair I had lasted me about 5 years and so I was sold on Harbinger quality.  Harbinger also fits me better than some gloves.  Basically, I don't have fat hands, but I do have fairly long fingers.  In addition to fit and quality, I was looking for additional finger protection and wrist wrap protection, which these glove have.The gloves are a washable leather.  I have not washed this pair yet, but my previous pair were washed several times with no ill effects to the gloves or to other items in the laundry.  Everything about these gloves is great.  I especially like the extended finger coverage, which goes past the lowest knuckle on me up to the midpoint before the next knuckle.  I used to tape there but no longer have to.The only minor downside is the Big Grip feature, which are imbedded rubber pads in the palm and fingers.  The rubber takes a few sessions to break in, and so in the meantime, it's not very flexible.  It is most noticeable on curls, where the additional bulk of the rubber prevented me from closing my fist as much around the bar.  One of the rubber pads was also digging into my finger for a few sessions, but I adjusted my grip and that has since subsided.  If this is a big issue, then I would recommend going for the gel padded Harbinger gloves rather than the rubber padded ones.I would definitely buy these again, and definitely have some loyalty to Harbinger gloves",0

"P.D. James is an amazing author.  I really enjoyed A Certain Justice.  The book was lengthy, yet very readable.  The cast of characters and their dirty little secrets are brought to life in evocative fashion.  James clearly has an immense understanding of the criminal justice system, which certainly was gained from her time as a magistrate and while working for the British Civil Service.  I notice that several reviews speak of a ""weak"" ending.  I disagree.  The ending is not only plausible, but possible.  It is always a treat, when reading one of Ms. James's novels, waiting for the first appearance of Adam Dalgliesh.  Amazingly, the story proceeds and is very intriguing before he and his murder team generally enter the fray.  Yet, one he arrives, the book then becomes very difficult to put down.  It should be noted that Ms. James introduces us to one of her most indsidious and evil characters to date.  A strong 5 star read",1
"  If you looking for one album that contains everything that you could possibly imagine in a thrash album, here it is!!! One of the best three masterpieces, along with ""State of Euphoria"" and ""Persistence of Time"", but this album got something to desire, is their own distinctive sound. Anthrax obviously was one the ""big four"" and is not to expect lesser than the other albums on that time. Here you got excellent drums, incredible guitar riffs and breathtaking solos courtesy of Dan Spitz. This album, ""Master of Puppets"", ""Rust in Peace"" and ""Reign in Blood"" makes the thrash scene back in the day!!",0

"I have faithfully used this video over the course of a CYO basketball season consisting of 12 year old boys and saw visible results.  This has been my third year coaching and I have taken bits &amp; pieces from books and videos through the course of each season to help me in organizing the offense, defense and practices.  This has become my favorite resource for practices and some individual skills. Out of the 48 drills, I rotated using about five or six at each of our practices.  The results were positive.  Toward the middle of the season, I knew which of the drills worked best for my team and which ones they enjoyed most.  There are also numerous tips that coaches wil find useful.  Our team's favorite drills were the creative shooting drills.  There were probably 20-22 of them.  All in all I would say this is very worthwhile to the following: parents, youth coaches with kids ages 8-16,and middle school coaches.  What this video may lack is absolute perfect basketball technique, but it makes up two fold in overall creativity and usefulness.  Great value",0

"""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is one of the best films ever made and Fox has recently released a fitting two disc DVD edition of the film. Fitting because the DVD is one of the best I have ever seen.Directed by George Roy Hill and written by William Goldman, the God of screenwriters, ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" stars Paul Newman, Robert Redford and Katharine Ross. How could a film with this pedigree be anything but good?What you may not realize, or know, is that this film made Robert Redford the star he is today. Paul Newman, already an established star having appeared in ""Hud"", ""Cool Hand Luke"" and ""The Hustler"", among others, was a bankable star and the film was made because he agreed to make it. Initially, he wanted to play the Sundance Kid, but eventually settled on the role of Cassidy. Robert Redford was not new to film, but he was nowhere near the icon he would become. He had some early success which was followed by a few clunkers. The pair became a match made in heaven and would go on to appear in more films together. On screen, they appear to be friends, much like their characters, and this adds to the charm of their relationship.Redford clearly recognizes the influence this film had on his career. His famous film academy and film festival are named after his character in the film.Butch and Sundance decide to rob the mail car of a train owned by a powerful rail baron. Butch is tired of the work and wants to retire, but he needs one or two big scores to set him up. After blowing up the rail car, they run off with the loot and hide out in a small town, at a brothel they frequent. Meeting up with the rest of their gang, they quell a revolt and decide to do one more job. They will rob the same mail car on the same railway, on its next run through the area. It is the perfect crime, no one would suspect the same train being robbed, so it will probably be loaded with money. After blowing up the car for a second time, they notice another locomotive speeding towards them and a crew of men on horseback alight from the car and give chase, chasing Butch and Sundance, and their two accomplices, for days, across many terrains. Finally, they realize the rail baron has hired a famous Indian tracker to help a band of men, including a former sheriff who is now a famous bounty hunter, catch the duo. After the chase, they return to the home of Ella (Katharine Ross), the Sundance Kid's girlfriend. Tired, they decide to leave the country and travel to Bolivia and begin robbing banks there.As I watched this DVD of ""Butch Cassidy"", two things quickly became apparent. This film is virtually timeless. With the lone exception of the song ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"", the film could've been made yesterday, the images are so clear. The second is that the DVD print is one of the most beautiful transfers I have ever watched. The cinematography by Conrad Hall (who would later work on ""American Beauty"" among others) is simply stunning and brings out all of the rich detail of the landscape. Everything is crisp and clear, when it is supposed to be, colors are bright and vivid, it's just beautiful to watch. It doesn't hurt that the stars are two of the most handsome men to ever appear in film, at the prime of their careers, and one of the most beautiful women to ever co-star. How did anyone get past all of that eye candy?The key to becoming fully invested in this film is William Goldman's screenplay. He introduces the characters in action, we learn as we go, and they are almost always moving, or doing something. Goldman fills their mouths with witty dialogue, showing us how their relationship works, and they are instantly likeable to us. This is basically a love triangle with Ross' Ella playing the go-between. The two men have a very close friendship, enjoying each other's company. But Cassidy loves Ella as well, even appears slightly jealous until he realizes his friend is the recipient of this woman's love, so they get along. Then, there is the famous chase. The railway baron's men chase Butch and Sundance for days, taking up a significant chunk of the film. But this scene proves to us how committed the two men are to each other and makes their future trek to Bolivia all the more believable. We have to believe there is a real threat and these men never let up on the chase, if they catch Butch and Sundance, they will be killed. As soon as they reach Bolivia, Goldman has a lot of fun with the characters again, exploring their relationships, rebuilding them in a way, and making them light hearted again. It is almost amazing to watch this film because if a studio executive were presented with the same screenplay today, it would probably not be made. It doesn't hit plot points at pre-determined pages, it tells an unconventional story, and we never actually see the villains. Goldman had the luxury of writing this film during a period in which studios were still able to work with somewhat unconventional screenplays. Of course, they wanted to make money as well, but they still considered film an art form.George Roy Hill is an underappreciated director. I think a large part of this is because many of his films are very humorous. Comedy is not as highly respected in Hollywood as drama, even though making a good comedy is much more difficult. So I suspect the humorous elements of most of his films made him less respected in Hollywood, but when your films are as good as ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" and ""The Sting"", you deserve some respect. He made his share of duds, but when he passed away a few years ago, Hollywood was robbed of a talent ready to make at least a few more classics.During this period, big screen Westerns were becoming unpopular. Perhaps the dearth of television westerns was keeping the public out of the theaters, but this genre was considered risky at the time. Recent films starring Burt Lancaster and others were failing to light the box office fire. The second disc contains a new ""Making of"" feature including interviews with Newman, Redford, Ross, former studio executives David Brown and Richard Zanuck and more. Zanuck reveals that he took a real chance in greenlighting this film, but fought for it all the way. He also haggled with Hill and the filmmakers, in an attempt to keep the budget under control; he became concerned when the film was projected to cost about $7.5 million (consider the average studio film now costs at least $125 million). But the film would go on to be a big hit. Such a huge hit the filmmakers followed this with the equally popular ""The Sting"".The second DVD also contains some archival interviews with the stars, some trailers and more.In the ""Making Of"" documentary, they discuss the inclusion of the song ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"". People fought against it but Hill and composer Burt Bacharach felt it would be the perfect accompaniment to the scene of Butch and Ella riding a new-fangled bike through her barn yard. It does work, but it is clearly not a fit for the period depicted in the film, and is the most dated element within the film today. It just seems silly today.""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is a superlative example of the treatment all classics should receive on DVD. This is a film every DVD library should have",0
I first read this treasure of a book in a children's literature class in college. It has been 50 years since this book came into my life and it is still one of my favorites.  The story and the illustrations are gifts to be cherished.  WON'T SOMEONE PLEASE PUT THIS TREASURE BACK INTO PRINT?,1
This book is excellent. It is a good mix of theory and practical insight. Kudos to the authors highly recommended for the professional and the layman alike. ,1
"This amazing score to the beautiful Jane Campion film, ""The Piano,"" proves Michael Nyman to be (once again) one of the best composers of our time. The score plays a major role in the emotions behind the film, and tracks like 'The Heart Asks Pleasure First' and 'The Promise' prove to be most haunting.If you liked this disc, I would recommend other scores by Michael Nyman such as 'Gattaca' or 'Draughtman's Contract'.[4.5 / 5] [A-",0
"I've never reviewed a book on Amazon before, but I really want to recommend this one. If you're headed toward the tenure track, or are even thinking about it, you should read this book. It's served as a nice counterpoint to all the advice books I've been reading lately. While those other books have been really helpful to me, this one's helpful in a different way--it shows rather than tells. It also helps remind me that things don't always come off well, despite our best intentions, and it's all too easy to ignore/forget good advice under pressure. Academic life is not all that it's cracked up to be, it can be a real grind, but it's still got plenty to recommend it, and Lang's painfully honest account reminds me to count my blessings. A bad academic job is better than many good non-academic ones. I'm recommending ""Life on the Tenure Track"" to my fellow grad students, and also to undergrads who have romantic aspirations for the professoriate",1
"Written at the end of his career and on the eve of the Holocaust, the Crisis stands, I believe, as one of the greatest one volume educations in print today.  Unlike his more &quot;technical&quot; works which rigorously deal with phenomenology in itself, the Crisis is more of a look at the need for phenomenology and phenomenological psychology in modern humanity's life.  Looking at the history of science and philosophy, Husserl traces the development and &quot;success&quot; of scientism and materialism.  In doing so phenomenologically, Husserl makes a very strong case for the need of phenomenology in order to overcome the lifelessness of materialism and inaugurate a &quot;heroism of reason&quot; and humanism.  Anyone interested in philosophy, science, sociology, civil rights, etc. I urge to read this book actively and critically.  For non-specialists and people who aren't &quot;scholars&quot; of any kind or degree may find the language a bit dense or heavy at times, but ! . . . it's good for you.  The volume also features appendices which include the classic Vienna Lecture as well as other essays and lectures.  The Crisis is a classic and brilliant look into science, philosophy and society which, unlike a lot of theory today, offers a cohesive system grounded in humanism, to wit, Husserlian phenomenology.  Please read this book",1
"I had bought this book with high hopes based on the reviews and description.  Make no mistake, this is a user's manual for several types of specific equipment (EEG-type) with very little background on how to interpret the readings or, more generally, on the various aspects of the neurofeedback field, or other methods of neurofeedback.  This is a book by a pratitioner for a starting practitioner (dealing with how to set-up electrodes, how to read charts, a summary of a couple dated EEG systems, and how to choose an office space).  It does NOT cover in any detail theory or discuss latest research.  Even as a reference for equipment/setup a quick internet search revealed several much more advanced systems available that were not even mentioned by the book.  The book references DOS-based systems and alludes to Windows based systems.If you are starting a business in this area and already have a firm grasp on the fundamnetals of this field then perhaps this book MIGHT be helpful, but anyone looking for an in-depth treatement of the wide range of neurofeedback techniques and/or comprehensive treatment of brain physiology/activity under different conditions should steer clear of this book - you will be disappointed.  I am just glad Amamzon refunded my money",1

"Okay, I think this is a funny book, but a let-down compared to some of Jim Davis's earlier books.  In spite of this, it is still funny, and still gets 5 stars.I like the comics dealing with Mrs. Feeny, and the ones dealing with Jon's Mom.  I would like to see what Mrs. Feeny actually looks like, however.Still funny, still entertaining, and cat's do not live to their 20's but it is a COMIC STRIP.  A very good one compared to some of the unfunny crap in newspapers these days",1

"I""m easy on fiction books. I don't care if plots are similar, or charactors underdeveloped or whatever. I am not a professional to critisize that kind of stuff. As long as it's fun to read, has some action, and not too unreal, I""m ok. But this book, which I actually finished, was the worse I have ever read. I liked when the wind blows and when I saw this on sale, I quickly grabbed it. (No wonder it was on sale!) The plot and writing was just so lame. (What was the plot anyway?) There was absolutely nothing interesting or exciting and the main idea was just so stupid. I am not a real Patterson fan but from what I read (When the wind blows, Jack & Jill, Along came a spider, Cat & Mouse) they were all good reads. This was urrr......... Not recommended.",1
"""The Big Combo"" is a crime syndicate run by a Mr. Brown (Richard Conte in a chilling performance). Police Lt. Leonard Diamond is Brown's determined adversary. Diamond's obsession with Brown is almost out-of-control, and according to Diamond's superior, he's committing far too many police resources to the job. But Diamond is single-minded. He loathes Brown and everything Brown stands for. Plus Brown's delicious girlfriend, society girl, Susan Lowell (Jean Wallace) makes the perfect damsel-in-distress, and Diamond really can't resist that notion. The film's plot is concerned with discovering a mystery woman named Alicia. It seems that she holds the key to Mr. Brown's sudden rise to power over another crime boss who has--according to rumour--absconded to Italy. As Diamond tries to find Alicia, his search uncovers other people who may hold information. Diamond and Brown engage in a race to find the witnesses/stoolies first. ""The Big Combo"" is marvelous film noir. There's the classic struggle of good vs. evil (Brown vs. Diamond), and Diamond is--as his name suggests--clean, clear, and utterly transparent. Richard Conte as Brown delivers one of the best performances of a crime boss I've ever seen. It's right up there with Richard Widmark as Tommy Ugo in ""Kiss of Death."" The women in the lives of Brown and Diamond are an interesting contrast. Susan Lowell, the ladylike improbable girlfriend of the hard, tough crime boss is in complete contrast to Diamond's equally incompatible girlfriend, a stripper named Rita (Helene Stanton). Susan Lowell is obviously taking a walk on the wild side in her relationship with Brown, and one scene in particular underscores their erotic connection. Mr. Brown's minions include the ambitious Joe McClure (Brian Donlevy) and muscle men Fante & Mingo (Lee Van Cleef & Earl Holliman). Just what is the relationship between Fante and Mingo anyway ...? Film noir fans should relish this film, and fans of Quentin Tarantino ""Reservoir Dogs"" will experience a sense of deja vu. The DVD quality was more than acceptable. Lighting was a small problem in a couple of the gloomier scenes--displacedhuman",0

"Ginny, an improbable mixed breed dog, was NOT the companion writer Philip Gonzalez set out to adopt when he went looking for a canine friend.  But once they bonded, Ginny was to prove not only a devoted friend to the writer; she also showed an extraordinary talent which resulted in many lives being saved, and man and dog becoming world-famous celebrities.  Ginny's singular occupation was rescuing cats -- cats at risk on the mean streets of New York, cats in perilous situations, cats in abandoned buildings, fighting for their lives.  During her long lifetime, Ginny was responsible for dozens of rescues of cats, and she and her devoted human companion appeared on dozens of television and radio shows.  She was recognized and awarded for her selfless bravery and devotion to helping homeless cats.  Anyone who loves cats, and/or dogs, should read this moving and amazing book.",1

"It is a rare occasion indeed when an artist can recreate the magic that was captured on a hit debut album and establish themselves as a leader of a musical trend, but with his second release ""Standard Time"" Steve Tyrell has done just that. With an ensemble of world-class players he covers some of the real jewels out of the Great American Songbook and together these wonderfully talented musicians give us renditions that will last a lifetime. Steve Tyrell is a special talent, so buy this CD and enjoy his excellent music for many years to come. If you enjoy crooners and big band swing, I would also recommend Monte Procopio's ""Swingin' With Style"". He is another crooner that can really swing and deserves a listen. ",0
"I was about 20 pages in to this wonderful autobiography when I found myself thinking, &quot;Man, I'm going to like this&quot;.  All 380 other pages, I was right.  Actually, I wish I could give it four and a half  stars, because I do have one small complaint about it -- Arthur Laurents in  many places in the book seems to be writing to people who know him already  and are, so to speak, looking for themselves in the index.  The story leaps  around from place to place and time to time and age to age fairly randomly,  and in more than just a few places people's first names appear with the  apparent assumption that all of us are going to know exactly who it is that  Arthur is talking about.  That said, there are also lots and lots and lots  of people that everyone knows about, and it is sort of gossipingly  wonderful to read interpretations of Katharine Hepburn as being sort of  weird, Lena Horne as being sort of wonderful, Jerome Robbins as being sort  of way too much about himself, etc., etc., etc.  Beyond all that there is  this man, Arthur Laurents, himself.  The flyleaf to the book says that he  has had a &quot;rich life&quot;, and that's putting it mildly.  There is  not only the magnificence of the body of his work, but there's also just a  guy who lived life to its way-beyond fullest.  He smoked dope (and, unlike  Bill, inhaled and liked it), he slept around because he found lots of  people sexy and attractive, he did what his heart called him to do in his  profession, he bitched with a lot of people and made friends with lots of  other people -- in short, if that's not necessarily who I would want to be  myself, it sure enough is somebody I would like to be friends with and  know.  This is a wonderful autobiography even for someone who has never  heard of Arthur Laurents, because it is all about people you've known all  your life, but it is also a wonderful autobiography because few people who  write autobiographies ever let that much of themselves show.  I loved it,  and I think you will, too",1
"This book is a must read before travel to Uganda.  It contains wonderful character development and provides a learning experience about life in Uganda and its history. Written from a Ugandan perspective. I read this book and the Brandt travel guide on Uganda before a 8/04 trip to Uganda and was enthralled with both. Much better than ""Gravity of Sunlight"".  Read Abyssinian and be prepared for hours of fascinating people, culture and history.",1
"OK, Here's the review:Buy this book and take it's message to heart.  I have purchased and given this book more times than I can count to people in all levels of business, and to friends who are at crossroads in their lives. I have seen some reviews here which take issue with the fact that the author's message is too far ahead of it's time, won't fly within the gridwork of a conformist corporate culture, or that the message is inaccessable due to the book's apparent lack of structure.  Well, the message and how it's presented are kind of the point, not the problem.  If the message won't fly in a particular company culture, the problem is within the culture.  Those groups need to pay attention more than any other, because they stand to gain the most.  The perspective offered here is unique and invaluable. It applies to more than the immediate situation, not just to surviving a job at Hallmark, or any job, for that matter, but can be applied to any aspect of life. If you are in business today, you can apply the lesson given here. If you are a CEO and think that workers are drones who need your company more than it needs them, accept the moral initiative given by this book and learn why change is good, both economically and sprititually. If you are a humble worker bee and are saddened by your present position, use this book as a springboard to give you the initiative you need to find a better place, one away from the CEOs who haven't read this book. That would probably make Gordon smile.This book is all those things that have already been said about it:  it's loopy, zany, wise, generous, playful, full of heart, loaded with quirky illustrations, and stuffed to the gills with genuine spirit. It's a non-traditional  and revealing take on that most pathological of institutions, the American corporation. In this case, the corporation happens to be a seemingly warm and fuzzy greeting card company. It's also a fun, quick read.End of review.I also want to offer a second book which Gordon personally recommended to me in 1990.  Years before he wrote ""Hairball"", he told me to read ""The Addictive Organization : Why We Overwork, Cover Up, Pick Up the Pieces, Please the Boss, and Perpetuate Sick Organizations"" by Anne Wilson Schaef. It inspired him enough to tell others about it; in turn, it opened my eyes to the real reasons behind the deep-seated problems within organizations, and I want to pass it to others. If you've already taken inspiration from Gordon's own gentle, brilliant book, check this one out, too.  If you haven't, then read both.What follows is a brief personal account of my interaction with the author.  Those looking for a traditionally structured review may wish to look elsewhere.I was VERY lucky to meet Gordon MacKenzie when I was at a low point in my career, having just (naively) taken a job with a division of Hallmark that existed at the outermost edge of the Mothership, a division which I came to learn was known internally as a ""red-headed step child"", and worse. In the five weeks that I had been there, the facade of colorful spontaneity and effervescent creativity had quickly given way to reveal a dysfunctional regime - it was rigid, grey, and structured - clueless both in the ways of healthy human interaction AND in the manner of the creative process.  Amid this depressing environment, Gordon noticed my work and was kind enough to introduce himself by presenting me with some photos of it, which he had taken himself. He was enthusiastic - the only senior Hallmarker I ever met who was - and bursting with ideas.  Gordon exercised no direct authority over any part of our department, but no one in a position of management dared to turn him away when he would frequently drop by unannounced.  To the consternation of that same management, and to my great delight, he came and went as often as he pleased, brightening the bleak outlooks in our department and spiriting individuals away to better jobs whenever he could. He was, as he describes in his book, ""The Diversion. The Disruption.  The Hope for Escape"".   He knew no creative boundaries, and, most telling of all, was one of the few encouraging voices I encountered while I was there.Sure, it was part of his job to be encouraging, and it seems likely now that neither I nor my situation were more than a blip on the periphery of his Big Picture, but, just the same, he always had time to really listen, to coach, and to offer genuine guidance; in other words, to be a mentor. I moved on after four years; I believe that without Gordon's support I would not have made it even six months.  Less than a year after I left, he left the company for good, and made it known in many circles that he couldn't wait to get out. The guard had been changed. The same messages he had been hired decades ago to deliver were still relevant, but were no longer welcome.  The company today reflects that mindset. Like so many others, I was saddened to hear of his untimely passing.As he states in this book, he would often be tapped for live speaking engagements, both in and outside the company.  Individuals lucky enough to have been there for at least one of them will happily recognize some of that material distilled into his book. To witness his presentation and the challenges it posed to a gathering of suits was to take a breath of fresh air in a very stale room. It was easy to discern, by reading the faces in the room, just who was absorbing it, really getting it. It was just as easy, and disconcerting, to look around a room full of Hallmark execs and see just how many closed minds weren't interested in absorbing a thing.  Imagine watching the most brilliantly colored paints as they slide off a myriad of bullet-proof, teflon-coated surfaces, leaving no impact or hint of their existence, and you get the idea. That scenario opened my eyes to the reality of the situation, and the reality of this book:  THE MESSAGE IS LEGIT; IF ONE DOESN'T/WON'T/CAN'T ACCEPT IT, IF THE MESSAGE ISN'T STRUCTURED IN A MANNER DEEMED ACCEPTABLE, OR FLIES IN THE FACE OF THE ESTABLISHED PARADIGM OR THREATENS THE GROUPTHINK, THE MESSAGE IS NOT DIMINISHED.  THE ONUS IS ON THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE CORPORATE ENTITY (COMPRISED OF INDIVIDUALS) TO OPEN HIS MIND, TO MAKE CHANGE HAPPEN FROM WITHIN, NOT JUST PERSONALLY, BUT COLLECTIVELY, AND CORPORATELY. This is not a book about finding a solution by the numbers. This is not a book about how to make it big by shoring up the status quo, or by rewarding the establishment for bad behavior. This is a book meant to inspire you to find your own path, to spark your own creativity, to find your own ways to incorporate those things into your business environment and your life. Grab it. Absorb it. Change your head. Acheive your own unique orbit.  You'll be glad you did",1

"It's a cliche to say any particular movie is the worst ever made.  I'm sure worse films have actually been produced.  I just cant think of them right now even after sitting here and trying for about 5 minutes.  To put it in perspective, the recent made for Sci Fi Channel movie ""Mansquito"" was a masterpiece compared to Dungeons and Dragons the movie.  Apparently some crackpot nobody guy wrote the screenplay and even directed this travesty of a film and was as much a genius at self-salesmanship as he an utter incompetent at filmcraft.  The blunders inherent here range from the systemic to the minutely technical.  In this one sense, at least, the film is consistent.  The casting is awful, the acting atrocious, the writing is phenomenally bad.  The sets and costumes rest uneasily in that wretched zone between camp and simply inept.  And then there is the plot.  Of course, the scale of the drama is truly grand, the writers were not afraid to embrace the tired cliche of every bad fantasy novel, of the unlikely band of heroes tasked to save the Universe and face the ULTIMATE MENACE.  Yet the plot frequently stumbles down even this well worn path, as each scene seems more jarringly unlikely and hackneyed than the one before it, to the point that one quickly loses any sense that there is a plot at all. By contrast, even basic Dungeon-crawls can actually make for pretty interesting and dramatic stories.  In fact, I think this is where a lot of D&D fans were really let down.  Even if only due to the random element introduced by the dice, the twists and turns of a reasonably good rpg session can be far more nuanced and interesting than your typical fantasy movie or TV series.  I think most people who have played an RPG at one time or another have thought of this, perhaps leading to the greatest hope that was dashed by this incredibly bad film: a real D&D game could probably have been the basis for quite a good plot.  But this movie bore little if any resemblance to even the most hackneyed D&D game ever played by anybody over the age of puberty, and rather than advancing the fantasy genre forward, it definately took it several steps back.On a more technical level, the completely ridiculous props and costumes which would have raised eyebrows in an Ed Wood film don't help much in the suspension of disbelief department, and the very clunky CGI rounded out the general feeling of complete disconnect.Even if you are the sort of person who likes almost any kind of science fiction or fantasy fare, avoid this, it will leave a bad taste in your mouth.  This is quite simply one of those films you just can't go along with no matter how much you might want to.  It's worse than the Postman, or Waterworld, or the worst Xena episode you ever saw.  I'm only giving it one star because I can't give it zero or negative stars.  I would actually for the record prefer to give this negative 5 stars.This is another classic blunder of marketing by WOTC, which goes back to earlier PR efforts in the history of the game and it's previous owners (TSR).  Once again they managed to make their fairly interesting game look completely stupid, following in a noble tradition including a really bad cartoon series or two and going all the way back to the botched 60 minutes interview where the reasonably benign Gary Gygax somehow came across like Charlie Manson.  I'm certain they could not have done a worse job of marketing this game to the mainstream if that was their original plan.  I guess the question is: what is their plan?",0
"Here's another great book from Charles Wells to make four-wheeling less a stressful shot in the dark and more fun. When you can put more of your attention on the `wheeling, the scenery and the companionship of friends and family, and less to not getting lost, the trip is always more enjoyable. I've used and reviewed all of Well's books and this one lives up to his usual high standard of accuracy, utility and value. In most cases, I've had a chance to take the book on a trip and spot check Well's work. I've almost given up trying to catch a mistake... because I haven't yet!. While I'm way too far east right now to spot check this time, I know parts of the area covered in this book very well and in those areas, I know he hit a bulls eye. The best part of Well's guides is the value for dollar. There's a lot of info packed into these books, from basic vehicle and trip prep, a primer on off-highway driving as well as specialized tips on the local areas. There's also a section on GPS and, of course, the maps and routes to some of the best four-wheeling SoCal has to offer. Guide to Southern California Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails is the fifth book by Wells on some of the best four-wheeling areas in the USA. May yours become as dog-eared and trail dusty as mine have become",1
"The Secret Service, Gerry Anderson's final Supermarionation series, sounds so odd that it might put off fans, but that would be a pity. This 13 episode series combines numerous Anderson trademarks, with both Supermarionation and live action, in a daring and delightful show. British comic Stanley Unwin voices Father Unwin, a priest (or is he?) and secret agent. Factor in Matthew Harding as the faithful operator, a shrinking ray, and the good father's odd eccentricities: talking in an offbeat language called ""Unwinese,"" driving a 1919 flivver, and you've got the makings of a quirky Anderson classic. For some reason the opening recalls the British cult series, The Prisoner, with all sorts of other ""anglo echoes"" throughout. As a fitting finale to Anderson's Supermarionation series, The Secret Service is last but not least. ",0
"If you're an artist, illustrator, cartoonist, just starting out or a seasoned pro, this is one that belongs in your book collection on a yearly basis.The 2002 edition starts out with an intro from the editor (thank you Mary Cox for this invaluable book) and a ""Keynote Address"" from speaker/consultant Ilise Benun on self-promotion.The 2nd section continues with ""Business & Marketing Seminars"", tips and guides that are very informative. Lance J. Klass, president of Porterfield's Fine Art Licensing (one of the best in the field) writes ""Ten Secrets to Success in Art Licensing"", and anything Mr. Klass writes is worth reading, reading again, and memorizing !The terrific Jim Hunt, cartoonist extraordinaire, writes ""From the Front Lines...Practical Advice from Freelancers to Freelancers"", and interviews 3 successful illustrators...I like the answers to Jim's question: ""Besides having a really ""cool boss"", how has working for yourself changed your approach towards getting up and going to work each day ?"".Of these and the 8 other articles, there will be at least half that you'll find fit in to your line of work, and you're sure to learn, and be motivated by them.3rd section: ""The Markets"". Listings on the many places you can market your work, and this needs to be updated yearly, as you'll find new entries, and very important, many new contact people on the listings from previous years (each listing is marked with an icon if it's new or has a change of address/contact person).The listings run the gamut from greeting cards to record labels, and there are 4 ""Insider Reports"" included.Many of the listings have web sites, which I always check, to see if the style represented is one I'd fit into.4th section: Artist's reps, web sites, glossary and indexes.It's a great book...it will help keep you in touch with what's out there, make you realize that there are a lot of opportunities to tap into, and if you're ever feeling ""stuck"", open it's pages, and send some post cards, slides, etc. to one or more of its market entries...it will get you moving, and you never know, you just might get a positive response",1

"Hanson's Between War and Peace is a collection of essays written between 2002 and 2003 about 9/11, the Afghanistan campaign, and the Iraq campaign.  Most of these essays were written for the National Review Online and are now reprinted here in book form.  These are excellent essays, carefully crafted, wonderfully written, logical, opinionated, often profound.  The terrorist assault of 9/11 changed our world, and Hanson well understands this.  He correctly rips apart the shallow, biased reasoning of the old world order, of the elitist media, of the boutique commentators and of the shrill leftist professors.  Hanson looks fresh at basic, critical strategies and tactics.  He calls for radical repositioning for America, but supports his arguments with carefully construed facts.  His is a conservative view, but with no apologies.  This is a must read",1
"This book is pure you-know-what (too much of a lady to say).  Basically, he took Barry Rehfield's words and dropped them into his so called ""book.""  It does not focus on the wonderful music that Derek & the Dominos created, but instead focuses on the personal lives of the band.  The author seemed to be more interested in bashing a mentally ill man in prison versus writing about the talented players.  I hope he makes no money from this book and, if he does, I hope he will give it to a charity who raises funds for the research for schizophrenia or assists musicians with mental disorders.  This would almost make up for his bashing of a wonderful player who was suffering when he played and created the beautiful music that music lovers enjoy in all parts of the world.Now, I'll jump off my soapbox and start writing my version of Jim Gordon's life....in a more positive way, of course.Cheers!Susan",1
"Anyone not already familiar with San Francisco will probably not increase his or her awareness with this book.  This is an anthology that includes excerpts, essays, and poems set in, about, around, or otherwise touching on San Francisco.  As such, the reader may be thrust into settings with no background, and the reader's own knowledge of and experience with The City (capital ""t"" capital ""c"", as the locals know it)will have to fill in the blanks.  In some cases the writing is about SF, but in many case the writing is about a subject with SF as the backdrop.  In any case, it works.  As an anthology this provides a great and varied selection, and if you see any of your favorite writers in the table of contents, you may encounter a rare piece of writing that you otherwise might not (like an enjoyable Kerouac piece on a job he held for a while; something from him other than an excerpt of On The Road).  Or, you may learn about an event that you otherwise know little of (the assasinations of Mayor Moscone and Harvey Milk).  If you love The City and/or any of the selected writers, try this book.  There are other books about other cities in this series (at least New Orleans and Los Angeles, I believe)",1
"These are outstanding performances of classics. I bought this DVD for the Walton concerto, a piece I have played myself and feel deeply about. However, the other performances were an excellent surprise. Piatagorsky interprets the piece commissioned for him with authenticity, passion, and the appropriate grace. Heifetz's Mendelssohn is always a joy to hear.One must note that these are HISTORICAL performances and should not be judged by their age and picture quality. You are getting performances that may be older than yourself, in my case certainly. (For more of that rant, see my review on the page for Rostropovich's performance of Shostakovich and Prokofiev, also on EMI.) In any case, these are easily ignored by those seeking authentic interpretations and an opportunity for a lesson from masters",0
"I had this white plastic portable paper towel holder I loved and I had it for about 20 years -- I'd never seen another one like it.  It was perfect for my apartment.  It fit nicely on top of my refrigerator and in my small kitchen, there really isn't any place for an under-cabinet mounted paper towel holder.  Then, one day, I knocked the thing off the top of the fridge and a piece broke off.This stainless and black plastic OXO Goodgrips Grip and Rip is close to the one I broke and better, actually.  The brushed stainless body of it looks great.  It has enough weight to stay put.  The rubber ring on its bottom grips the countertop and leaves no marks of any kind.The bottom of the unit has a slightly raised rim to keep the towels from unwinding on their own, and unlike another unit I considered, the base isn't larger than it needs to be -- yet it will hold the large-sized roll of towels as well as the smaller standard size.What I really like about it is the fact that the whole unit rotates on a bearing when you pull towels off.  You can put your hand flat on top of the knob to steady it, and the stainless top of the knob allows the unit to rotate underneath it.  When you've unrolled just the number of towels you want to tear off, you only need to grip the clingy rubber underside of the knob with your hand and the unit won't turn so you can tear off the towels.To refill, just press the black button top center on the knob and it comes off so you can remove the empty carboard tube and slip on a new roll.  The knob snaps easily into place again.Couldn't be simpler and couldn't work better.  And it fits into the limited space I have on top of the fridge.  Seriously, I have to hand it to OXO Good Grips -- their products are typically excellent and this one is, too",0
"As we continue to pave over the beauties of our world and turn them into concrete wastelands, it is good to think back what life was like 150 years ago before we began the process of destruction in earnest.W. H. Hudson, the naturalist, is revered in Argentina, where they refer to him as Guillermo Enrique Hudson and name streets and towns after him. In simple and stately prose, he writes about his boyhood as one of several sons in an English family that ran an estancia on the Pampas. Despite several failed attempts to school him, he managed to pick up one of the best educations available: by using his eyes and ears to study nature. His skill in language, which is considerable, came from reading his father's books on his own.Whether writing about ombu trees, plovers, snakes, lightning storms, rheas (Argentinian ostriches), or his neighboring ranchers, Hudson brought a whole world to life with this book. Hudson published FAR AWAY AND LONG AGO in 1917 while he was living in England -- around the same time that a Frenchman named Marcel Proust was following where that elusive taste of madeleines led him in REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST, and around the same time that World War I was destroying a whole way of life. As he writes in the book:""It is difficult, impossible I am told, for any one to recall his boyhood exactly as it was. It could not have been what it seems to the adult mind, since we cannot escape from what we are, however great our detachment may be; and in going back we must take our present selves with us: the mind has taken a different colour, and this is thrown back upon our past. The poet has reversed the order of things when he tells us that we come trailing clouds of glory, which melt away and are lost as we proceed on our journey. The truth is that unless we belong to the order of those who crystallize or lose their souls on their passage, the clouds gather about us as we proceed, and as cloud-compellers we travel on to the very end.""FAR AWAY AND LONG AGO is perhaps one of the greatest autobiographies ever written. Although I finished reading it several days ago, I am still feeling its afterglow and get this itch to re-read passages from it. This is, indeed, a book that will withstand several readings.",1
"Not just ""there I was in a whiteout"" stories, although those are in there.  The sixteen pieces represent attempts on Everest back to the Twenties when Mallory disappeared.  They are in chronological order, which is helpful because many of the writers refer to past history in their work.  All but three are excerpts, but as always, carefully chosen so that you enter and exit the work without feeling confused.  There are selections about the early exploration of Everest and then a detailed third-person account of the first ascent in 1953.  Geoff Tabin writes about the dynamics of an expedition and the labor that goes into making even an unseccessful assualt on the mountain.  Willis puts an interesting spin on the idea of ""survival"" by including two interesting accounts - one explaining why the previously strong bond between Messner and Habeler didn't ""survive"" after their 1978 triumph without oxygen, and a first person account by Maria Coffey, who after losing Joe Tasker to the mountain traveled ther with Peter Boardman's widow to find closure for her own ""survival"".  And there are the epics: Venables' near fatal overnight bivouac on the mountain, Anatoli Boukreev's rebuttal of ""Into Thin Air"", which cast him in a poor light, an account from Lene Gammelgaard, a less-known participant who nearly died that brutal night in 1996, and my favorite - an emotional yet self-effacing first-person story of that same disaster by Michael Groom, one of the guides, who reflects not only on his own near-death, but the helplessness of a guide who could not save his clients: it was he (among others) who walked away from Beck Weathers and left him for dead.  So all in all a great read on many aspects of Everests history, and if mountaineering gets your blood going, don't overlook the earlier series volumes""Epic"", ""High"", and ""Climb"", all packed with riveting tales of death and survival from mountains around the world",1
"Plenty of books have covered the Kabbalah, but choose psychologist/healer Catherine Shainberg's Kabbalah And The Power Of Dreaming: Awakening The Visionary Life if what you seek is a practical application of Kabbalah principles to daily spiritual purposes. There are practices used by seers, sages and prophets to control dreams and visions: Shainberg uses the ancient Sephardic Kabbalah tradition to blend in stories from around the Mediterranean, to be used as examples for readers seeking to develop their own dreaming powers. A fine, specific exploration based on solid spiritual foundations.",1
"My table was shipped on a Thursday and at my house the next day!!!  As someone mentioned, the directions make it seem more difficult to assemble than it is.  There aren't that many parts to put together.A tip:  Because of the weight of the box, I recommend opening the box and taking the parts to their destination individually.  Ours is on the third floor and I took about three or four trips to get everything up there.I use it daily and really miss it if I don't get to.  I could really go for some inverting right now.  I found the cuffs very comfortable.  Shoes/boots are helpful, but my body has adjusted to hanging from my ankles even in socks.  I should get commission on these things.  The first weekend we had it, we had a birthday party for my sister and everyone tried it and many will buy it.  GREAT deal!!",0

"Excellent book and about time.  Sibley's orginal book was just too large to carry around so we used Kauffman as a field guide.  While his book is also good, Sibley manages to give you pictures of the same bird in its juvenile plumage, males and females, morphs, flying and other variations.  You can really get a more positive ID on your birds with this book.  I also have the one for Eastern North America for visiting friends in Texas and beyond.  The more books the better, but Sibley's divided versions of his big book is a must",1

"Back in the 60's, the balletic duo that were Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn were all the rage in the ballet business. They danced with passionate chemistry and artistic integrity, committing themselves to their performance so harmoniously that they seemed to exist only within the time/setting of the ballet's fantasy world itself. Swan Lake, Tchaikovsky's first ballet, was initally a dismal failure in St. Petersburg. But he cleaned it up, revised the score and continued to stage it and it became a much loved ballet. For a prima ballerina like Margot Fonteyn, the dual role of Odette/Odile is a star vehicle and dancer's ticket to fame. She becomes the character. Her dancing is virtuosic, and yes, as one critic pointed out, her body type is apparently a bit bigger than the very frail, bony ballerinas of today - Allesandra Ferri is sickly thin sometimes. Fonteyn is still talked about as a major star and all ballet connoisseurs an fans revere here work. Likewise, Nureyev was a great figure in the ballet world, a man who would influence the later star Mikhail Borishnnokoff. Nureyeve got into his characters with dramatic flair and dancing bravura. As Prince Siegfried, he is totally convincing. Fonteyn and Nureyev'spas de deuxs are miraculous to watch. The look of the film is dated and grainy but that's due to its age- this is a 60's performance. But it still looks good and the sets and costumes are gorgeous and just what I imagine when I dream of Swan Lake",0
"Okay, I bought this item at Walmart a while ago.This product does NOTHING to treat/prevent acne and further breakout. I know it's a cheap one, but also it doesn't work at all...

"Shows how hard folks have to work to put their vision on film. The book details the hugh support network Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino had in putting out their ""Grindhouse"" experience. There are tons of interviews and many full page pictures detailing how certain things were accomplished in the back to back movies, ""Planet Terror"" and ""Death Proof."" Tarantino has a great introduction to the grindhouse movie theaters (drive ins were mentioned as well) experiences in the 70s and early 80s.I am quite satisfied with this coffee table sized, behind the scenes look",1

"While I am a Christian and was only mildly interested in the Shroud, I  never based my faith on the Shroud. I have always been quite skeptical  about the claim it was the burial shroud of Jesus. After a careful study of  the book, I must confess my skepticism has been severely challenged. Also,  the book reads like a well-written mystery. One of the most intriguing  works I have read in years. Leon McKenzi",1
"I love this book, it has some of the best photographs of jewelry to come out in years.  If I could look at only one vintage costume jewelry book for an entire year, THIS would be it.  There are tons of photographs of jewelry across the price spectrum, and at least a little bit of information about a lot of designers and companies.  There are a few errors, such as some of the Bakelite she has pictured is actually Lucite or plastic, and some of the plastic and Lucite she has pictured is Bakelite.  And while some of the pricing is exactly in line with what you would expect to fairly pay, some of the values are outrageous. But in a book this big, it can't all be perfect.  This is the best book for new collectors, as it hits all the &quot;big&quot; names, doesn't gloss over the &quot;little&quot; names, and covers so much.  It is also a great book for long time collectors.  I have collected vintage costume jewelry for over 15 years, and I have over 50 cj books in my reference library; believe me when I say this book is wonderful eye candy",1
"The Disney treasures collection is the best and cheapest way of getting the entire series to their golden age shorts. I must warn you not to buy any of these mini DVDS if you are someone who would love the full collection being the mini DVDS are just repeats or shorts due on future disney treasures. GOOFY has Stared in 76 colored shorts in total from 1935-1965 Below is a complete list of all his appearnces. it comes in 4 collumns: first the episode number, then the date, then the official clasification of the series it comes under, then the title. All Episodes clasified as Mickey Mouse are seen in both volumes of Mickey Mouse In Living Color, Any clasified as Donald and Goofy are seen in the donald Duck collection which you can check out the same details of on both donald duck dvds on amazon in my reviews.The Goofy DVD has all 46 classified as Goofy. the only 2 Goofy cartoons upto the 1960's that are still not available and have no furture treasure that are due out which could include them are his very last 2 original cartoons made in 1965 classified as Educational, which I think is why their not on his DVD being their not clasified as Goofy, nor are they part of any other disney series on the other treasures.ANY OTHER CARTOONS STARRING GOOFY OTHER THAN THE LIST BELOWwere either theatrical movies, plus movies that were shorts combine when originally released which you can get on DVD now such as Mellody Time which are all classified as part of disney's masterpiece collection, but their is one movie with a goofy short not classified as disney masters which is THE RELUCTANT DRAGON, you can get the reluctant dragon on the disney treasures volume of: BEHIND THE SCENES which includes the short of HOW TO RIDE A HORSE. Or TV series and Specials made in the modern age which are not part of the treasures really. but below is a complete list of all his original production golden age shorts. but I have to say, another Goofy cartoon famous to all Goofy fans not included in the Treasures: SPORT GOOFY IN SOCCERMANIA, it has not been released at all in the USA, but has on the UK Edition of Extreme Sports Fun,also it includes How To Ride A Horse, which means if you just want the goofy short and not the whole Reluctant Dragon Movie you can get 2 goofy shorts on this one UK DVD that are missing from Goofy's Treasure whicg just leaves his two educational shorts from the 60's left to find or hope a DVD to be released with and; you can get on amazon UK, as long as your TV is less than 5 years old it will have pal playback and aslong as your DVD Machine is multi region or free code then you will be able to play the UK DVD no matter what.ALL SHORTS STARRING GOOFY1	1935	MICKEY MOUSE	Band Concert 2	1935	MICKEY MOUSE	Mickey's Fire Brigade3	1935	MICKEY MOUSE	On Ice 4	1936	MICKEY MOUSE	Mickey's Polo Team 5	1936	MICKEY MOUSE	Moving Day 6	1937	MICKEY MOUSE	Moose Hunters 7	1937	MICKEY MOUSE	Mickey's Amateurs 8	1937	MICKEY MOUSE	Hawaiian Holiday  9	1937	MICKEY MOUSE	Clock Cleaners  10	1937	MICKEY MOUSE	Lonesome Ghosts 11	1937	MICKEY MOUSE	Magician Mickey12	1938	MICKEY MOUSE	Boat Builders13	1938	MICKEY MOUSE	Mickey's Trailer14	1938	DONALD AND GOOFY	Polar Trappers  15	1938	DONALD AND GOOFY	Fox Hunt 16	1938	MICKEY MOUSE	Whalers 17	1939	SPECIAL	The Standard Parade18	1939	GOOFY	Goofy And Wilbur  19	1940	MICKEY MOUSE	Tugboat Mickey 20	1940	DONALD AND GOOFY	Billposters 21	1940	GOOFY	Goofy's Glider  22	1941	GOOFY	Baggage Buster  23	1941	MICKEY MOUSE	Nifty Nineties 24	1941	MICKEY MOUSE	Orphan's Benefit 25	1941	GOOFY	Art Of Skiing  26	1941	GOOFY	Art Of Self Defense  27	1942	MICKEY MOUSE	Mickey's Birthday Party 28	1942	MICKEY MOUSE	Symphony Hour 29	1942	GOOFY	How To Play Baseball  30	1942	GOOFY	Olympic Champ  31	1942	GOOFY	How To Swim  32	1942	GOOFY	How To Fish  33	1943	GOOFY	Victory Vehicles 34	1944	GOOFY	How To Be A Sailor  35	1944	GOOFY	How To Play Golf  36	1944	GOOFY	How To Play Football  37	1945	GOOFY	Tiger Trouble  38	1945	GOOFY	African Diary   39	1945	GOOFY	Californy Er Bust!  40	1945	DONALD AND GOOFY	No Sail 41	1945	GOOFY	Hockey Homicide  42	1946	GOOFY	Knight For A Day  43	1946	DONALD AND GOOFY	Frank Duck Brings 'Em Back Alive  44	1946	GOOFY	Double Dribble  45	1947	DONALD AND GOOFY	Crazy With The Heat  46	1947	GOOFY	Foul Hunting  47	1948	GOOFY	They're Off  48	1948	GOOFY	Big Wash  49	1949	GOOFY	Tennis Racquet  50	1949	GOOFY	Goofy Gymnastics  51	1950	DONALD DUCK	Crazy Over Daisy 52	1950	GOOFY	Motor Mania  53	1950	GOOFY	Hold That Pose  54	1951	GOOFY	Lion Down  55	1951	GOOFY	Home Made Home  56	1951	GOOFY	Cold War  57	1951	GOOFY	Tomorrow We Diet  58	1951	GOOFY	Get Rich Quick  59	1951	GOOFY	Fathers Are People  60	1951	GOOFY	No Smoking  61	1952	GOOFY	Father's Lion  62	1952	GOOFY	Hello, Aloha  63	1952	GOOFY	Man's Best Friend  64	1952	GOOFY	Two-Gun Goofy 65	1952	GOOFY	Teachers Are People  66	1952	GOOFY	Two Weeks Vacation  67	1952	GOOFY	How To Be A Detective  68	1952	MICKEY MOUSE	Pluto's Christmas Tree69	1953	GOOFY	Father's Day Off  70	1953	GOOFY	For Whom The Bulls Toil  71	1953	GOOFY	Father's Week-End  72	1953	GOOFY	How To Dance  73	1953	GOOFY	How To Sleep  74	1961	GOOFY	Aquamania   75	1965	EDUCATIONAL	Freewayphobia No. 176	1965	EDUCATIONAL	Steel and America",0

"This book was written almost perfectly. As a true crime reader I go through many books and find the Author stays on one situation to long or goes over and over again on it and then   the suspense leaves and/or I have to skip a few pages here and there because they drag out the history of the town and then drag out the trial. This Book did neither. The Author did a wonderful job. It was a horrible story of Murder and greed and you will not be able to put down the book.P.S.

"Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman deliver Oscar worthy performances,while Jason Robards won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this moviewhich is (in my opinion) one of the best ""political"" films ever made. I'm not even sure if it was nominated for Best Picture, but I have to say...This movie was better than ""Rocky"" OK. The movie won four Academy Awards;The one I mentioned above, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Art Direction, and Best Sound. It's also rated PG, which is strange because they use the word f**k at least 8 times  in this movie and nowadays, two uses can get you slapped with an R rating. But the movie opens as we witness four men breaking into the Watergate Building, which we all know was the setting for Democratic National Headquarters. The police show up and catch the men in the act of setting up survelliance/bugging the place and the story shows upBob Woodward's (Redford) desk. Woodward is a reporter at The Washington Post who reports the story and then begins to see oddities about it. Why would men break into the Democratic National Headquarters? Who sent them? Etc. Eventually joining in the act of helping him is Carl Bernstein (Hoffman) who begin a thorough investigation of the scandal that begins to turrn up names very high up in government and eventually even The President of the United States, Richard Nixon. Bernstein and Woodward worked their a$$es off to get this story, through apparent death threats and when people wouldn't talk to them, and they got it all right. Robards plays their boss, Ben Bradlee and deserved his Oscar. Another performance that was really good, although his face is almost entirely hidden in shadow is Hal Holbrook as the mysterious Deep Throat. Deep Throat was one of Woodward's informants who apparently worked high up in the government and seemed to know everything about the Watergate cover-up. Except he refused to just give up and information, only hints and could never be directly quoted or even referred to. Woodward, to this day has not given up the identity of Deep Throat or even gave the vaguest idea of who he might've been. Anyway, for a movie about reporters trying to unravel a cover-up, this movie was incredibly entertaining and exciting. It's never boring, it's never dull; both Hoffman & Redford play their parts extraordinarily well, which causes us to like the movie even more. And it's strange too, the movie doesn't end with Nixon resigning; but instead ends with Nixon taking his 2nd Oath of Office. We're given the remainder of the details as they're typed up on a Typewriter. I though the ending was abrupt, but perfect.GRADE: A",0
"Informative, unbiased and not overblown history of Buddhism. A former Unitarian as well as more than a few Chritian denominations, Ms. Ross covers the 3 branches with very readable prose.  When the subject of miracles comes up, she's objective and does not impose on the reader to  believe them.  As you might expect, she compares Buddhism with western  religions throughout.   It's obvious I enjoyed the book but for another  reason as well.  I sense that Ross is herself a compassionate one who  treats her readers with respect for their intellect and was inspired by  that.  Myself,a former conservative Christian (I just couldn't &quot;get  it&quot; for some reason), I appreciated her unbiased and objective  writing.  As Leonard Da Vinci stated (roughly):  An investment in knowledge  about a subject is an increase in love for the subject.  In this case, the  subject is love in a broad sense - a love to help people find happiness by  seeing this great religious tradition from its roots as well as current  thought.   Great book!  Always the hard part, tho: practicing what you  learn.  But Rosses words inspire me to &quot;practice&quot; and not  &quot;try&quot; so much",1
"REVENANT starts out in a popular &quot;Buffy&quot; location:  a cemetary.  Buffy, Willow, and Angel are there because of Willow's friend, Jia Li Rong, who, with her family, has emigrated from China to America.  [Yes, this story takes place before high school graduation.]  In the first chapter Mr.Odom manages to give us some background on Chinese beliefs, including that of the Hungry Ghost; a funny look at male-female communication differences, and sets us up for the fight in chapter two.  The book gets even better from there.  I have no idea if the author is describing the fighting moves accurately, but he writes the battles in such detail that I could easily picture them in my mind.  This adventure's well-meaning [sort of] character meddling with forces he doesn't fully comprehend is Jia Li's older brother, Lok.  The further you read, the more you'll learn about why Lok is the way he is, but you'll still have to wonder if he'll survive to be sadder but wiser in the end.   Speaking of sadder but not-necessarily-wiser, Xander falls for a beautiful Asian superwoman who rescues him from one of the many nasty situations that fill this story.  You know it's not going to work out.  It's only a matter of learning how it won't.  There's a gang of mixed humans and demons causing death and destruction and a mysterious Chinese businessman named Zhiyong.  Supposedly, he's here to create lots of new jobs in Sunnydale, but we don't believe that, do we?  Of course not.  Did I mention the danger-packed fight scenes?  There are probably chapters without one, but it won't seem that way.  Everyone gets to use his/her talents to save the world from the evil magic-infested threat.  Even Cordelia and Mrs. Summers get a chance to help.  Mr. Odem is one of the Buffy novelists who manages to write the characters accurately, including their funny side.  REVENANT is really worth adding to your collection..",1
"A really fun read - very informative as well. Tom Santopietro examines the music, film and television career of this true legend and convinces even the most skeptical critic of what a great artist she was. His style is amusing. His insights are spot on.  He calls her recording career second only to Ella Fitzgerald's and actually made me want to go out and buy a number of the recordings.  His anaylsis of her movies was objective yet complmentary. Highly recommended -- entertaining, informative and makes you realize how great Doris Day actually was",1

Prior to ordering this gate I was using ugly, plastic garden fencing to keep my little dogs out of the living area.  This gate looks terrific.  It was easy to put the pieces together.  It's sturdy and I was so pleased I ordered 3 more to block the dogs from other areas of the house.  It's very easy to step over, too.  Probably wouldn't work for large dogs or hyper little dogs that jump.  But my little dogs see the gate and walk off and ignore it",0

"This is my second James novel. I read The Murder Room which was written by James a few years ago and I thought that it was dreadful. It is a 500 page bore or snore. The present work was written over 40 years ago by a James in her prime. It is short and compact; and, it has a nicely balanced structure with good characters. It is written with straightforward and simple prose and it is a compelling read that is hard to put down. In short, it is what one can describe as a masterpiece.The book opens with the literary hook: a murder in a clinic basement of the Steen Psychiatric Clinic during a busy Friday afternoon in London. On discovery of the murder, the doors of the clinic are sealed, Dalgliesh is called in, and we are off on the hunt for the killer, or killers.The novel has an interesting set of characters, but not too many characters. It appears that there are just a half dozen suspects with a motivation to be involved with the killing. The mystery unfolds slowly, and the reader is given a few clues just ahead of the Dalgleish.Readers will not be disappointed, and the book demonstrates the fame and ability of James as a crime writer. Most will want to keep the book and set it aside to read again in the future. Also, the book demonstrates again that more is not always better than less. In the elaborate 550 page slow moving story told in The Murder Room, the author has a 95 page introduction and no crime until around page 130. We wait as Dalgleish does not enter the investigation until almost page 200. Thankfully, all of that type of writing is missing here. In a Mind to Murder, the story is well underway and the reader is fully engaged by page 10. James tells a well balanced and a compelling tale in half the space.Since the book came out in 1963, it has had approximately seven printings by three different publishers including Faber and Faber, and Penguin. It is easy to understand why.",1

"This is the book I have been looking for.  This book very clearly describes the techniques I needed to put into regular practice to improve my piecing skills.  For example, I have always wondered about the ""skant 1/4-inch seam.""  How wide is that?  How can I be precise in my piecing if the measurements aren't precise?  ARGHHHH!  Then, along came this book. I read it  cover-to-cover and immediately put some of the techniques into practice.  Ms. Collins explained how to cut the pieces properly so you can sew precise 1/4-inch seams and forget about trying to find that mysterious skant 1/4-inch!  This may sound silly, but I experienced an ""A-HA!"" moment while fine-tuning my rotary cutting skills using the information provided by Ms. Collins.WARNING!  There are no ""short-cut"" techniques here.  This is definitely NOT a book for someone looking for how to do it faster or quicker.  It is a book about how to do it BETTER.  Ms. Collin's clear descriptions are enhanced by excellent photos and diagrams.  I also bought Ms. Collins' book ""Borders, Bindings and Edges: The Art of Finishing Your Quilt"" - another book I wholeheartedly recommend",1

"Other people have said this is a movie you'll remember ""for a long time.""  Well, I watched this mini-series on television when I was 7 years old, and scenes from it still stick out in my memory almost 18 years later! I'm buying the set today and plan to eventually share this mini-series with my own children, so that they ""remember to never forget.""  For those who wish to protect their children from images of violence, be warned, there are fairly graphic depictions of the atrocities committed during the Holocaust.  My personal opinion is that depictions of violence are everywhere, and these depictions at least have the benefit of conveying, in a manner that mere words cannot, an important aspect of world history",0

"As I mentioned in another review on dosage math, dose response curves are driven by simple ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It helps to know the mathematical foundations, but the solutions to the ODEs are intuitive: dose a patient of a given weight, watch the blood level rise, peak, and then begin to decline until the next does is given. Change key parameters, and you don't change the nature of these curves, only the particulars change--peak dose time depends heavily on patient weight for example.  The examples in the INTERACTIVE CD really help to solidfy the concepts.Alex Alaniz Ph.D.1.

"I've been a devoted pilates practicer for over 6 years, and was somewhat sceptical about any kind of workout that tried to turn classic pilates into a more aerobic-type exercise. Still, I had an Ellen Barrett DVD (Self Sleek and Slim) and liked both the workout and instructor (she's extremely personable and has impeccable cueing), so I thought I would give this DVD a go. I'm very happy to report that I love it. I think Ellen does an excellent job at applying pilates exercises to a standing and mat workout that makes you sweat. I love the feeling of simultaneously stretching & stengthening my body while also burning fat. And even though the routine moves at a relatively slow pace, as other reviewers have pointed out, the use of weights really gets your heart going. I'd rather move at a steady pace and do the moves properly (that's a pilates principle!) than flail around at a frantic speed, as is the case with so many workouts. Many people seem to think that unless it's really fast paced, you're not getting a good workout--and that's totally wrong. I should add that I've always found weight training boring and have avoided it, so I'm very happy to have found a way to incorporate some into my workout. I also think that people with no pilates background can probably do just fine with this DVD, but you'd probably get more out of it with even some rudimentary instruction in pilates. I would recommend the Stott videos (also all excellent) starting with the beginner Pilates Mat workout. I work out 4-5 times a week, and have been using this DVD at least 2 times a week for 6 weeks now. I still look forward to it.  Highly highly recommended.",0

Rachel teaches us that old items, either in their found state or painted fresh white, are to be cherished as little pieces of history, and I can tell you that the old linens, silverware , china and furniture that I collect (and use!) are much better made than most of the new items available today. What I most love about her books is that she shows you how to create a calm and serene refuge at the end of each day. Buy this book, you won't regret spending the money.

"My 4 year old daughter LOVES this book.  Mostly because she can relate to Lily's excitement about her new plastic purse that plays a ""jaunty tune"", her glittery movie-star sunglasses, and her jingly coins.  I love it because it offers so many little lesson to discuss along the way.  We talk about how Lily could've handled things better.  We talk about why the pictures show her getting smaller and smaller (she feels remorse for her actions). We talk about how telling her parents what she had done was a great decision because they were able to help her correct her mistake.  And, we talk about what to expect at school and how to have good manners, respect, etc.  Lily is such a loveable character, and so much like my daughter that it's just natural that we both love her and this book so much!

"This is the revised edition of the Author's previous ""Xuanzang: a Buddhist Pilgrim on the Silk Road"" of 1996. The book received excellent reviews but a few flaws were picked up. Wriggins has corrected most of these drawbacks in this 2004 edition that has slightly changed name: ""The Silk Road Journey with Xuanzang"" pointing the index more on the travel route than on the character. This change of title was probably an editorial choice since the Silk Road is presently an appealing subject.Fortunately, this book is really about Xuanzang, the 7th century Buddhist monk, that traveled for 16 years and 10,000 miles from China to India and back to quench his spiritual search for the perfect form of Buddhism (he himself later on founded a rationalist chinese sect that lasted a few years), to acquire and bring back the original buddhist texts to undertake a meticulous and truthful translation of what was to become the principal Chinese religion for years to come.Xuanzang's journey and adventures are retold and condensed from his original ""The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions"" that he wrote for the Emperor Taizong and his biography written by his disciple Hui-li and integrated by the Author's travels and studies, that however are never mentioned as such. Xuanzang's journey started from Chang-an (Xian) and through the Silk Road carried him to Tashkent, Samarkand, Balk to the Southern deviation to India. Here he stayed for many years visiting Buddha's sacred sites and practically all the Buddhist monasteries then existing. He also traveled down to Southern India, without however reaching Sri Lanka and after 13 years he started back loaded with manuscripts, artifacts and also a white elephant, gift of King Harasha. On the way he met kings and scholars, he entertained courts and monks, he saw all the important monuments and historical and religious sites of medieval India ed he thoroughly explored the various buddhist schools and sects until he gained spiritual and mental satisfaction of his curiosity.Describing Xuanzang's progress the book takes the leisure of inserting images (beautiful photographs and art reproductions), maps, legends and connections to other cultural contexts so that every page is a new discovery. Much of the pleasure I experienced reading this book was due to the beautiful figures appropriately inserted in the text and the precise and explicative notes. More than 80 pages are composed of notes, legends of figures, glossary and bibliography.Another word must be spent for Xuanzang's legacy that is magistrally explained. His adventurous journey gave way to a series of popular tales and legends that were successively written down during the sixteenth century in the ""Journey to the West"", translated into English by Waverly and known as ""Monkey"" and one of the best known Chinese novels of all times. The precise description he made of all his sightseeing has represented the scientific basis for archeological exploration in Central Asia and Northern India. His translations of Buddhist texts are still utilized today. He is a part of the collective memory of one nation and in this era of globalization of the whole world.I read this book right after Schafer's ""The Golden Peaches of Samarkand"" and it helped me to immagine the Tang times in a wider context. As noted by other reviewers the Author takes for granted a knowledge of Buddhist thought during that period. If you get confused, a good help if you don't have other texts available is ""The Religions of the Silk Road"" by Foltz that gives a summary excursion of religious thought of those times.This book posesses a rare quality and that is the capacity of stimulating curiosity for further reading on the subject. When finished reading we have a complete knowledge of Xuanzang as a man, and we can't but admire his integrity, intelligence and culture but at the same time the small excerpta of his original writing inserted in the book are not enough to really satisfy our curiosity, so further reading is ahead!P.S. If you like books that narrate old travelers journeys without having to read the whole ancient texts read ""The Adventures of Ibn Battuta"" by Dunn, that in many ways remembers ""The Silk Road Journey with Xuanzang"".",1
"Gang Of Four is one of the most intelligent and articulate bands I have ever listened to.  The lyrics to each song present a unique and analytical view of modern society with a very dour British sense of humor.  Some people have criticized the band for their ""excessive negativity"" and Marxist leanings, but as I stated before, the lyrics are actually very clever and funny and the music is anything but dirge-like.  As for the Marxist thing, the lyrics are Marxist in more of an intellectual sense than a poltical one.  There's no empty sloganeering or ""smash the state!"" type rhetoric here, just a plea for sanity amidst the absurdities of consumer capitalism and imperialist aggression.  As for the music, lots of new bands are attempting a Gang Of Four-type style but end up sounding more disco than anything.  ""Entertainment"" IS funky but it's also very hard-edged and even menacing and the band never forsakes tight songwriting in search of a groove.  There's also great variety.  From the almost heavy metal opener ""Ether"" to the angular funk of ""At Home He's A Tourist"" and the almost avant garde ""Anthrax,""  every song is exciting and interesting.  And those lyrics....    ",0

"I probably can't improve on Amazon's editorial review on the first page of this site, because it says it all,but I will try anyway. This is the most revealing book I've ever read about any aspect of the Beatles, probably because it is told in Paul's own words, in that honest, matter of fact way that all four of them always had. And that's one of the reasons we love em. It really is more of an autobiography. There are three outstanding things about Many Years from Now. One is Paul's recollections about almost every Lennon McCartney song; who wrote what,and each writer's contribution. He even remembers where he was when he wrote each song,and he remembers smells and other people in the room,or what was happening in his life at the time. Very vivid memories. It's incredibly exciting to have this written down in a book that you can refer to any time. Also,his recollections match John's for every song except just two, In My Life and And I Love Her. That's amazing considering John did his song by song thing back in 1980, and Paul deliberately didn't look at it just to see if their memories matched, and they do. Speaking of John, the second wonderful thing about this book, is the facinating, personal info. that Paul brings to light about his best friend and song writing partner. It's obvious that Paul's feelings for John are deep and complicated and tied up with very strong emotion. He goes into a lot of detail about this. I don't understand some reviewers' remarks that Paul is somehow petty because he claims to have written the music to In My Life. Why is this so difficult to believe? Are some people so enamored by John Lennon that they can't imagine that he might have made a mistake? And why do they seem to think that Paul is the one who's lying here? Paul's been saying that he wrote the melody since John's 1980 interview came out. Why would he keep saying it if he didn't feel it  was  the truth? All through the 70's John was given to mood swings about Paul. Sometimes he loved him and sometimes he said the most outragiously rude things about him. Also, not for anything but how many acid trips did John take in the 60's? Not to mention his heroin use. Can't be so good for the memory. They are actually believing every word that this man says instead of someone who took only a few acid trips and never used heroin. John's feelings often changed with the wind. How could people have missed that? Anyway the third lovely thing about this book is Paul's candidness about everything. For instance, he talks about how he once became sexually aroused at the sight of his mother in her underwear. One reviewer was discusted by this but wait a minute. How many guys would ever admit something like that? Anyone who's read the Kinsey Report about human sexuality will know that there is nothing abnormal about this. But no one would ever admit it. To say the least there was certainly an oedipal thing on Paul's part,concerning his mom. This book is filled with no holds barred,honest stuff like this, and I found it refreshing. No one can ever again, say that Paul holds anything back. He also speaks very candidly about his drug use,revealing a few startling surprises. There is a section about the recording of each album which was wonderful. He talks about his early relationship with Linda,which I enjoyed. What I didn't like is that he dismisses two very important ladies, Dot Rhone and Jane Asher. I guess he has his reasons but I would have liked to see his candidness about these two for a change. I think it is because he didn't want to trespass on their privacy and also, Linda was pretty jealous especially about Jane. This book covers only his youth and the Beatle years, so Wings fans won't find anything here. He also tells the facinating story about his near nervous breakdown after the Beatles break up. The first time I read this book was when it first came out and I was really bowled over by it. At the time I didn't know much about McCartney. What an eye opener. I read it the second time just recently, and I had the same reaction. So I bought it. I will read it again because I love it and want it in my collection. If you only read one McCartney book it should be this one, but there are others that I recommend if you are so inclined: Paul McCartney the Definitive Biography by Chris Salwicz is very good. And of course the Anthology book, and Hunter Davies' authorised biography. Also Ray Coleman's Paul McCartney Yesterday and Today about Paul's music, mainly Yesterday. Even McCartney, the new one by Chris Sandford is not bad, but it is the weakest of the ones mentioned here.But this book,  Many Years From Now is the BEST McCartney book, bar none. It is essential reading for not only Paul fans, but Beatle scholars as well. Even casual fans will enjoy it.     ",1

"F.F. Bruce is probably one of the finest New Testament scholars there ever was and possible there ever will be.  Why?  Because my New Testament Studies professor in college said so, despite disagreeing with every single conclusion Bruce ever made about authorship, dating, or importance of the various books of the New Testament, not because of a lack of scholarship or invalid arguments or data, but simply because he did not wish to have the same conclusions as Bruce.  That says a lot for a scholar.  In addition, the research he has done is superb and the writing style is sublime.  You will see other New Testament authors go into lengthy discussions on dating alone, but Bruce somehow manages to condense his entire argument into something that will fit in your shirt pocket.  That also says a lot, both for the man and the work.  The fact that it is still so widely regarded among not only NT studies folks but laymen only further proves its staying power.  However, despite its refreshing brevity, I do wish Bruce had taken the time to go into greater depth on the books themselves, tackling some of the more complex problems of authorship of more of the NT books.  Still, it's quite good and worth your time to read no matter which side of the fence you're on",1

"So, the interface for the new version of Internet Security is very nice and is very easy to use.  I have used the previous version in the past upon the recommendation from CNET as the one of the best internet security suites available.  I have not been disappointed.  The software was very easy to setup and start up and seems to be very secure with regular updates and scans.  Fortunately, I have a prety isolated network so I don't worry too much about virus contamination but I do want to monitor my network's usage - especially since I have a wirless system.  The software allows me to monitor such activity easily and alerts me to anyone trying to get on without permission.  The one time I did have a virus, the realtime scan function caught it before it could embed itself into my system and deleted the malicious code immediately.  I haven't seen too much activity overall from the sentry software which is a good thing (I think) and attests to the overall functionality of the software (I think).  Either this is a great piece of programming or my computer has been taken over by spyware gangsters in Russia and I'm none the wiser.  I hope this help",0
"I had the opportunity to be a foreign exchange student in France from 1991-1992 and thankfully found this before I left. Not only is this a great dictionary but logistically you can actually take it with you. Many translation dictionaries are so big that taking with you while on vacation, a business trip or any other reason would not be possible because of it's size and weight but this fit into the pocket of my coat. It's a little too big to fit into the back pocket of your jeans but it's size is still small. Overall this is a wonderful dictionary and one that I personally used extensively during my year and France and now use it again while trying to teach my daughters to speak french (the memory fades a bit after 13 years!)Special Note:  This is a new updated French/English English/French dictionary released in 2005.  Previously the last update was in 1980 so be sure if you're shopping around to get the new version vs. the old version. ",1
"I felt like I was taking a walk down memory lane as the author shared tales of how it was to grow up as a boomer ... from the diet products to the gizmos and gadgets that were used to lose weight.   As I was growing up, I never heard anyone talking about how important it is to take into consideration who the dieter is - what his or her needs are -not just nutritionally, but mentally and emotionally, as well.  Even though there is a great deal of nutrition information in these pages (all very well worth the reading), it's the appreciation that one diet approach doesn't work for all.  With four different plans geared to the various different personality types, there's no question you'll find a way to be successful.  I highly recommend this book and hope others have the success that I've been having.  I no longer look at food as the enemy",1

"FRA ANGELICO may be a museum catalogue for the current exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, but it is also one of the more impressive historical documents on this important painter and his influence on the world of art in the library today.  The book is a masterwork of scholarship and visual examples of this 15th Century artist.Words fail in describing the degree of integrity of scholarship of the contributors. Under the curatorial guidance of Laurence Kanter the museum has gathered seventy-odd paintings, drawings and illuminations from books by Fra Angelico, and then to add to the dimension of the great master's influence, they have added some fifty works by his students and disciples.  While Fra Angelico shines in his extraordinary sense of detail and representational art in a period when art was flattened decor and just entering the blossoming of the Renaissance, the works included by his pupils are quite staggeringly beautiful.  Some would say comparison to the master is unfair: history offers another vantage, that being the concept that the truly great teachers enlighten their pupils to exceed the teacher's creations!While the visual components of this fine book are incomparable, the various written sections by not only Laurence Kanter, but also by Pia Palladino, Magnolia Scudieri, Carl Strehlke, Victor M. Schmidt, and  Anneke de Vries not only inform - they also read like a novel of the life and times in 15th Century Florence. In every way this is a magnum opus that represents well the Museum's exemplary exhibition of the work of Fra Angelico.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, October 0",1

The only saving graces of this album to even make a STAR was Sertab's &quot;One More Cup of Coffee,&quot; Jerry Garcia's &quot;Senor (Tales of Yankee Power)&quot; and, of course, the Dylan performances. What they should have done was thrown out four of the tracks and put in the extra Dylan performances in the film, including &quot;Dirt Road Blues,&quot; &quot;I'll Remember You&quot;, &quot;Blowin' In the Wind,&quot; and &quot;Amazing Grace.&quot;  My fave from this album is &quot;Cold Irons Bound.&quot; Vicious, angry, cynical, and just...Dylan. This and the other three good tracks make it worth buying USED. But not new",0

"I'm going to begin with a quote from the book:""Hold your hands out over the earth as over a flame.  To all who love her, who open to her the doors of their veins, she gives of her strength, sustaining them with her own measureless tremor of dark life.  Touch the earth, love the earth, honour the earth, her plains, her valleys, her hills and her seas; rest your spirit in her solitary places.  For the gifts of life are the earth's and they are given to all, and they are the songs of birds at daybreak, Orion and the Bear, and dawn seen over the ocean from the beach.""In August, 1924, the author, Henry Beston went to his small beach house on Cape Cod intending to stay for two weeks.  He ended up staying the year, and this book is what resulted from the editing down of his notes, written out longhand at his table.  I can compare this book best to Pilgrim at Tinker Creek by Annie Dillard.  More than a book, it is a combination memoir, meditation and natural history of Cape Cod.  The book is loosely arranged in a chronological fashion, and at various times, Mr. Beston meditates upon sea birds and shore birds, the formation of the waves at Cape Cod, shipwrecks and the coastguard, and the qualities of the sand.  It is a deeply spiritual book, although not overtly religious.  Mr. Beston's primary religion appears to be that of the earth and living lightly upon it, and allowing oneself to accept the rhythm of it",1
"This book helps bridge the gap between the pre-war big band era and the modern juump blues bands and eventually rock and roll.  It is a very readable book, whether or not you are familiar withn Jordan's life and music.  Because Louis Jordan was such a big influence on Chuck Berry, I found it particularly interesting in developing the context from which rock and roll arose.  To fully appreciate this book, have recorded versions of Jordan's music available for reference",1
"The author is a wedding planner and she basically provides a series of ancedotes that reads like a wedding self-help book.  Not everyone is obsessed with having the &quot;perfect wedding&quot; and has to fend off &quot;snotty florists&quot;.  Snotty florists may be an issue for the New Yorkers she depicts, but certainly isn't the norm for everyone else.  I guess the goal of the book is to give you confidence to do what you want, but there are much better books out there.  I think getting a good wedding planning book and some bridal magazines is a much better investment",1

"This is Kevin Kelly's own summary of his bottom- line conclusions."" 	As we make our machines and institutions more complex, we have to make them more biological in order to manage them. 	The most potent force in technology will be artificial evolution. We are already evolving software and drugs instead of engineering them. 	Organic life is the ultimate technology, and all technology will improve towards biology. 	The main thing computers are good for is creating little worlds so that we can try out the Great Questions. Online communities let us ask the question ""what is a democracy; what do you need for it?"" by trying to wire a democracy up, and re-wire it if it doesn't work. Virtual reality lets us ask ""what is reality?"" by trying to synthesize it. And computers give us room to ask ""what is life?"" by providing a universe in which to create computer viruses and artificial creatures of increasing complexity. Philosophers sitting in academies used to ask the Great Questions; now they are asked by experimentalists creating worlds. 	As we shape technology, it shapes us. We are connecting everything to everything, and so our entire culture is migrating to a ""network culture"" and a new network economics. 	In order to harvest the power of organic machines, we have to instill in them guidelines and self-governance, and relinquish some of our total control."" This is the kind of book I find extremely difficult to know how to read. I just do not have the proper scientific- technical background to evaluate the kinds of claims which are being made here. And this when I am naturally skeptical about books which claim to have a sure general understanding of the shape of the human future.  My skepticism also relates to the meaning of this kind of 'evolution' for the lives of individual human beings, and for society as a whole. Is the suggestion that we are on the verge of some vast transcending or de- humanizing of humanity, some creation of an 'organic collective mechanical consciousness' which will somehow 'direct' or guides society as a whole.?If so , once again, what does this say about our own individual freedom and identity?

"This book serves as a map to the world of the handknitter.  It isn't a travelogue -- you won't stay long in one location or learn too many of the details -- but you will get the bird's eye view.  She deals with charity knitting, a big area for many knitters.  She deals with specialty techniques such as instarsia in a simple cotton bag.  She deals with knitting in the modern age with patterns for things such as a palm pilot cover and information on web sites and knitting mailing lists.If you are a beginner or intermediate knitter, buy this book, read it to learn what you can this go round and put it aside.  Take it out in a year or so and read it again.  As you progress as a knitter, you will find more to learn and gleen from this book.  You won't get tired of it any time soon",1

"The Corps of Discovery comes alive in this author's capable story-telling talent.   The personal introduction of how the Lewis and Clark adventure affected the author's life brings context and relevance to the story from the beginning and instills the author's passion in the reader.   Taken from the logs written during the adventure, you are led to discover with them all that they discovered as if for the first time.  You will never look at America west of the Mississippi quite the same way again.   Your imagination will soar with the wild country it was not that long ago.   More than dry scientific and anthropological studies, the Lewis and Clarke journals are an adventure travel log full of surprises and discovery.   Mr. Ambrose has done an outstanding job of sharing his sense that history is an adventure.   You will find it difficult to put this one down once you start",1

"This 1978 album from Ralph Towner is another one of his gems. Apart from his solo outputs that generally I always prefer to his more orchestrated albums, I think this one surely ranks among his best. And you can imagine it just reading the line up. Ralph with Eddie Gomez and Jack DeJonehette. A dream team in deep jazz field. What can I say that previous reviewer didn't tell you already? I will say almost nothing about the music because if you are reading this I think you surely know what kind of music we're talking about. ECM Towner's jazz. You simply have to know it is a GREAT album. But talking about the experience you are about to live putting this disc in your player ... I mean, it's a very intense music experience. These ECM albums when they are great as this one are really trips. You can seat in front of your system (hoping it's a good one) and fly away with your mind. The music is so trascendent, so spiritualistic that takes you to another place, lets you think and dream. The opener Waterwheel is a modal tune with a fantastic rhythmn work provided by DeJonehette. Than the album goes on with a more intimistic atmosphere, each tune directly connected with the one that precedeed it. Even the 16 minutes long tune Batik does not have weak moments. I can suggest this album to you Towner's listeners if yo don' own this one already. I know this album costs a lot outside Europe (but even in Europe is not cheap at all ... is this the reason why this album is the less sold among Ralph's discography?). But think about it. Beautiful things always costs a lot of money. Take it this way ... but don't let this one pass by",0
"This book is amazing - not only does it contain everything current a person could ever need to know about current PCs (and if something new does come out, the author will talk about it on the included website), but the author is kind enough to include any previous edition of the book on the included DVD. I had thought that I was fairly knowledgeable about computers, and reading this has boosted that knowledge considerably. No repair tech or computer builder should be without this",1
"Beyond being a history of pro football before, during, and after the WWII years, using the ""Steagles"" of 1943 as the focus, this book is a social history of America during those times, and a very engagingly written one at that.  I quickly began to feel I was back in 1943, a fan intently following the Steagles but also acutely aware of the larger and more important surrounding world of war.  Clearly, this book was a labor of love for the author--I don't think there has been any kind of overwhelming demand for a book on the wartime NFL or the Steagles!The book falls somewhere between an informal narrative and a scholarly text.  For example, there are several pages of end notes, but they are not individually numbered or referenced with superscripts.  The author has clearly done in-depth research and done it well.  Many facts and figures are presented, and I found essentially nothing to quibble about among those I have expertise in or could check.  The players, the game they played, and the world of war around them, are presented in a lively but non-sensational manner. To my relief, there were none of the standard ""cute"" but unverifiable stories of old time ballplayers presented as fact.  Though the author interviewed several surviving members of the Steagles, all in their eighties now, they apparently took his book as a serious enterprise and did not ply him with such ""cute"" recollections.  Just one note:  The author mentions that the Steagles had a high ranking rushing defense, and were proud of their pass rush as well.  Since in 1943, the NFL treated what we would now called sack yardage as yards lost rushing, these two actually go together.  I was surprised the author didn't mention this connection--given the high quality of his research, I'm certain he must be aware of it.Very highly recommended",1

"The good thing about Missionary Conquest is that it forces you to reconsider assumptions about the role of missionaries to indigenous cultures.  That's good.  There isn't much else to recommend this book to you, because Tinker is not trustworthy.  At the beginning of the book, Tinker states that when examining the primary source material, he will rewrite the Indian side of the encounter without even telling you.  That should have been a giant red flag, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt.  After all, maybe he is right, and that the primary sources misunderstood or even misstated the Native American side of exchanges.  However, it turns out that he felt free to rewrite what the white people did, too!I actually bothered to look up one of his sources on De Smet.  In fact, it was one of his clenching arguments for his thesis on De Smet.  And, it turns out, Tinker completely rewrote the white side of the exchange as well, so much so that Tinker essentially wrote nearly the exact opposite of what happened.  You can view the book ""History of Early Steamboat Navigation on the Missouri River"" online at Google books yourself if you don't believe me.  Pages 196-198 are the relevant pages.Sadly, I don't have time to look up all his sources, but needless to say that when your primary argument against someone relies on completely mangling the primary source, what does that say about the book as a whole, especially when he admits to completely rewriting the Native American side of nearly every exchange?So, if your goal is to get another perspective on the role of missionaries to indigenous cultures, then sure, read the book.  If your goal is to find an objective account of what happened in this period, then this book is certainly NOT the book to use.  Due to the rewriting of primary sources I don't consider it scholarship as much as propoganda.Also, if you want a good, positive book on a missionary who respects indigenous culture, I recommend Bruchko",1

Sentences like the following on page 71 abound: ""When you hear not so often as you wish, remember, our silence means our safety,"" the Committee of Secret Correspondence  - now doing business as the Committee for Foreign Affairs, although Franklin, who had never mastered the original name, was not to know for months - soothed the envoys, whom they understood to be starved for news.     Schiff needed a good editor but didn't get one.  This certainly isn't Pulitzer grade material.  I wonder if the publisher rushed this book into print in time for the 300th anniversary of Franklin's birth.     Van Doren in his biography gives a better account of Franklin's years in Paris.",1

There are details that have not previously been revealed about the early shows, the American tours, Brian, the drug busts in London,  it goes on and on.....extremely interesting to anyone a bit fanatical about the Stones (but who else would be reading this review?).....this one is original material, not a fan ripoff and definitely worth your money.....",1

This is the story of Gurdjiefffs journey to pursue truth.  His life itself looks like the journey to the truth.  He is the mysterious thinker in the twentieth century.  But his and his friendsf motivation to pursue something is fundamental interest of human nature and really pure.  Mysterious incidents slip into daily life.  Most people ignore them or doubt their eyes.  But some people stick on and investigate them.  They went anywhere to find even just a clue to the mystery.  It is like seeking treasury.  For them treasury is neither jewel nor money.  In the trip they run across various kinds of remarkable people.  It is true that gbirds of a feather flock together.h  You can enjoy this journey with Gurdjieff deep in Orient and mystery of human being and accumulated wisdom,1

"Many of these reviews have mentioned how much adults like Justin Roberts as much as - or more than- their children. So much of what is available for children today is frenetic and nonsensical, and everything has its place. But as a high school teacher I see less and less introspection and more MTV mentality: make it fast, make it flash, forget about the depth.  Justin's music allows quietness to enter the car, and encourages families to talk about the import of the song. ""Moving"" in particular, struck a chord with my husband as his family moved frequently. We were able to talk with our daughter about the stability of our home, and how objects around us gain significance.Throughout this album are kernals of parent-child time, rich with memories of moments spent alone with parents under the stars, on a camping trip, or just in the house. I cannot recommend this album more, if not for a child, then for the child in you",0
"What a refreshing new look at Gnosticism and the Christian Kabbalah! This is the only book that I have been able to find that presents a clear, easy to follow veiw of the Christian Kabbalah, truly a revolutionary work that Gnostic practitioners will continue to refrence for generations to come. The work takes the reader into the basic teachings of the Christain Kabbalah through a study of the Sefirot (aspects of God) and universes, with an exelent introduction explaining what the Kabbalah is and how to study it. and various appendicies that will aide the reader in their understanding of the book. Also very helpful were the meditations at the end of each chapter which allow for a personal experience of the ideas spoken of in the chapter. This work presents intruging ideas about St. Mary Magdalene as the wife of Jesus, Jesus as a man and a mystic, as well as many other characters often misunderstood in the Bible. This is an absolutley essential work for anyone interested in Gnosicism or the Christian Kabbalah",1
"DEA Agent Bill Broxton has been assigned to protect Prime Minister Ramsingh of Trinidad, because a Drug Cartel wants him killed. It seems Ramsingh has been cracking down on the cocaine trade that has been passing through his country enroute to the United States.

"THE VICTIM'S PERSPECTIVE by George Magner haunted me as I read it.  For some time during the reading and after the reading, I experienced discomfort that could not be defined.  My logic persisted.  One might carry persistent logic and troubling thought unconsciously while one drinks a cup of coffee or tea, looks for a four leaf clover, or studies the beauty of the sky.  So suddenly,  A VICTIM'S PERSPECTIVE came to my reader's mind full blown and fully defined.  Fully formed was the  problem for which I sought clear definition: this book possesses a basic flaw: it is fallacious.  Simply explained, as each of us knows, if one becomes a VICTIM of another, if another has harmed one with residual infirmities as the author states, there is legal recourse for those victims which brings justice, if harm be proved, to those claimants.  Unless Magner has sued the particular chiropractor and won the case placed before the scrutiny of experts for or against chiropractic, before the tried and true twelve jurors, then he has not proved his case.  If he has won such a case, then I stand corrected.  If not, I find this book trite.   If Magner's case against chiropractic is true, it should be proved to be so under scrutiny not requiring an organization such as he has formed.  There is a fallacy herein that needs to be addressed and judged if one reads THE VICTIM'S PERSPECTIVE, by George Magner.  ",1

"The Four Feathers by A.E.W. Mason is a riveting tale that relates the natural human need for redemption through a story that realistically depicts the complex interrelationships between love, friendships, trust, and courage.Harry Feversham, a young man who finds himself born into a historic family of proud British military men, wants nothing more than to be free of such a heritage. Whereas his forefathers fought and died with great courage, Harry is petrified of risking his life for his country and mentally labels himself a coward. Nevertheless, he has little choice but to follow in his father's footsteps. When Harry's regiment is finally summoned to go to war in the Sudan, Harry's fear of his own cowardice overcomes his fear of his father, and he accordingly resigns his commission. Once three of Harry's closest companions uncover the reason for his decision to resign, they decide to each send him a single white feather to signify his cowardice.What ensues is a story of Harry's heroic attempts at redemption, not only from his friends and from his father, but also from the girl of Harry's dreams, who, being present at the time Harry receives the feathers, adds her own to the original three.Throughout the exciting events and plot twists of The Four Feathers, Mason presents to readers a reality of human emotions and impulses which cannot draw comparison. The characters of The Four Feathers explore the complexities of humanity, loyalty, friendships, love, courage, and justice in such a fashion that each reader can relate to in his or her own individual way, making each turning of the page even more personal and captivating than the last. The three most primary characters of The Four Feathers, Harry, Ethne Eustace, and Jack Durrance, become involved in a triangle of love, loyalty, and misleading each other about how each feels about the other two in order to try and preserve these traits.Mason's novel, The Four Feathers, is highly recommended for all those seeking an exciting romantic adventure to capture their attention for hours on end. There is no question that Mason's work is one of the masterpieces of twentieth century literature.",1
"I saw Elvis in Concert about a month ago and it was amazing! One of the main highlights was when he played a song that I had never heard before called Kinder Murder.  I think I orderd Brutal Youth the very next day.  The album is Fantasmic it has so many great track's including: 13 Steps Lead Down, You Tripped At Every Step, All The Rage, and Sulky Girl just to name a few.  There are only about two songs on the CD that I can't listen to, and for me that is very rare.  The album end's with Favourite Hour which is just a beutiful song.  After I found out this record was originaly released in 1994, I asked myself what in the world was I was doing listening to Stone Temple Pilots, When I could have been listening To Elvis Costello's Brutal Youth.  I only thank god I'm listening to it now. ",0

"Television's ""Marquee Moon"" is in my opinion the greatest guitar rock album of all time. It took what punk would turn out to be and made into a shot of new wave, rock and jazz. Tom Verlaine composing the songs with a serious attitude, Richard Lloyd jamming at light speed, Fred Smith jazzing up his bass structure and Billy Ficca pounding at the drums as if he was running for his life. Marquee Moon is simply put, the must own album for ""guitar god"" lovers. It transcends you into a world of innocence, pain, beauty and love. And that is why Marquee Moon should be on everyone's list of favorite albums",0
"This is a much needed book so that a citizen in the world today can begin to grasp a modicum of understanding the Chinese's sense of inscrutablity.  Nixon was very careful to lay the groundwork for his visit.  Kissinger's involvement was critical, but MacMillan's work shows us how Nixon consulted many sources before he made his world changing visit.  If a reader wants to see how complex the American way of diplomacy truly is, this is an eye-opening book.  An easy book to read, thanks to MacMillan's graceful style of writing, it nevertheless contains some profound analysis about what has and is happening to the world today because of Nixon's week in China.  This is must read for anyone who deals in international trade, diplomacy, or academic exchanges",1

"First off, to address some of the earlier reviewers, it is worth noting that few composers have the luxury of complete control over their careers. They have to earn a living sometimes; Shostakovich's work during the last years of Stalin's life come to mind as an immediate example. I don't know what motivates Higdon to compose, but I do know that the output is gorgeous. [And, I might add, the late Robert Shaw--despite his association with the choral classics--was also a champion of newer music; it's great to see them continue the trend.] Top billing on this CD goes to ""City Scape,"" written for Spano and the Atlanta SO, and based on Higdon's memories of Atlanta itself. The resemblances to Barber are fairly obvious, and the sound is incredible. The other work is the slightly shorter ""Concerto for Orchestra,"" consciously modeled on Bartok's, written for the centennial of the Philadelphia Orchestra. I was in Philadelphia when it premiered, but not knowing who Higdon was at the time, I passed on the chance to see it. Hearing it now, I regret that decision. Works like this are hard to write--the listener's interest must be sustained, while still showing off the skills of the orchestra--and harder to perform well. But the ASO rises to the occasion. Another top-notch job by Telarc.",0
"This book supplements other books about the lives, works and legacies of the Bronte sisters.  It includes entries on sequels and adaptations of the works of Charlotte, Emily and Anne as well as coverage of their juvenilia. The book itself is organised alphabetically, has indexes, cross-references and contains over 2000 entries.Highly recommended for those of us who can never have too much information about the Sisters Bronte.Jennifer Cameron-Smit",1
This book is so awsome!!! I bought it at a school book fair and I fell in love with it the minute that opened it. My kids and I try a new recipe at least once every other week. I can't get enough of it. I strongly encourage anyone (especially African-American families) to have one of these cookbooks in their household. I almost wish that I could have grown up in the Pinner family so that I could have enjoyed all of that good cooking! This book is truly a keeper!!!!,1
"I'll agree with the other two reviewers that Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers' &quot;Ugetsu&quot; is a five star CD, but I thought it would be helpful to provide to some specifics about this recording.  &quot;Ugetsu&quot; was recorded live at Birdland on June 16, 1963, and is one of three albums made for the Riverside label (&quot;Caravan&quot; and &quot;Kyoto&quot; are the other two) during a two year hiatus from Blue Note.  The personnel is the same as on the classic Blue Note &quot;Free For All&quot; -- Freddie Hubbard on trumpet, Wayne Shorter on tenor sax, Curtis Fuller on trombone, Cedar Walton on piano, Reggie Workman on bass and the great Blakey on the drum throne.  The sound is excellent (though not as quite as good as the &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; volumes), and unlike many live jazz dates that just showcase live versions of songs from other albums, the material on &quot;Ugetsu&quot; is unique to the Messengers' discography (except for &quot;Ping Pong&quot; and &quot;The Theme&quot;).  The CD features three bonus tracks (7-9), and they are as good as anything else from the session, with the exception of the title-track which is by far the disc's best composition.  In all, fans of Blakey's Blue Notes will thoroughly enjoy &quot;Ugetsu.&quot",0
"Lifehouse plays like every other post 90's boy band with heavy radio airplay.  They have not revolutionized anything, they have not introduced anything new, they really don't stand out in any unique way.  That being said, they are very good at what they do, which is to stay perfecting the typical sound.Lifehouse at its core is a very formulaic rock structure not unlike the hundreds of bands that were formed after the mainstream success of Matchbox Twenty, Goo Goo Dolls, Foo Fighters, etc.  The structure of every song is a predictable derivative of ABACAB.  This unfortunately means that many people will too quickly write this band off, when closer inspection will reveal something very surprising underneath.  While Lifehouse is just another band using ABACAB, they do it better than most bands out there.It is because of the sound they chose being so popular among bands that they are forced to do it better than the rest.  It is because they do it better than the rest that, even though they are not unique at what they do, they are one of the best at it.  Their lyrics are not unprecidented, yet they will stick in your mind.  The guitar solos are not exactly complex, yet you hear more to the music than the notes they play.In my opinion, part of this success is due to exactly the same reason others will denounce it.  That is, we have all heard this sound so many times before that we expect a certain feel to come from it--and then Lifehouse delivers.  We know the formulas so well that we expect B to follow A, then A again, then C, but Lifehouse manages to please you by causing you to anticipate a certain pattern--and then Lifehouse delivers.  I am not trying to imply an evil master strategy or psychology from 1984, but Lifehouse knows what we like from past precident--and then Lifehouse delivers.Jason Wade's vocals take on the typical angst-ridden boy band lead vocals, but you can hear gems scattered throughout the songs that have to have been inspired by Van Morrison and Eddie Vedder.    Wade's vocals are another instrument in the mix that plays to peak performance where it needs to.Given the talent shown in the first two albums, I see no reason why they cannot continue to be a great success for years to come as long as they do three things: 1) Stay together, because too many bands that could have been something self-destructed when success was near.  2) Evolve with the style of the times, even if only slightly to maintain the fans they already have.  3) Keep writing music, because they are in that perilous area right now where they can be easily forgotten if they don't fight for the limelight.It is truly a surprise to find such a talented band on the inside that only appears at first glance to be just another typical band",0
"The fourth book in The Sandman Chronicles, Season of Mists picks up where the second volume, The Doll's House left off, continuing the story of Dream and his siblings. Unlike the previous books, Season of Mists focuses mostly on immortals (or those close to it) rather than mortals. Only one of the chapters of the book even took place on earth, and that was dealing with the dead, not the living.Because of this slightly different format, Season of Mists introduced a lot of rather colorful characters. Some were the relatively familiar faces of Norse, Egyptian, and Eastern gods, angels, and demons, while others were new characters, delightful and colorful in their own way. I particularly liked the contrast of Order and Chaos and, of course, the faeries, but that was a given to anyone who knows me at all.I promise, though, I won't dwell on them here. I love Nuala, but in Season of Mists she really plays a very small roll.The central plot of Season of Mists is the abandonment of Hell. Lucifer closes it, turning out all the souls, and then gives the key to Dream to do with as he will. This, naturally proves far more complicated than it originally seems.Most of the story is concerned with the direct repercussions of this, particularly among the (relatively) immortal creatures of mythology. The result was one of the most fun chapters I've read in a long time-the chapter where they all come and present their cases to Dream, trying to win Hell for themselves. The interactions were entertaining, and the different ways that they tried to persuade Dream to give them the key to Hell, along with their reasons for wanting it and plans for it, were as varied and entertaining as they are.I have to admit, that I was a little disappointed with the ultimate decision, and I wish that I could have known who Dream would have chosen if no one had interceded, but I do admit that the decision that was reached was the only one that could be reached. It did, however, raise an interesting point when Hell was given to its new owners and re-populated. I'm not sure that I agree that it's worse to be tortured to be redeemed and made a better person than it is to be tortured for no reason, but I can see how, with eternal torment, this might be the case. It is, after all, easier to bear unpleasant things if you can be righteously angry about them.Woven in with the main story of the ""battle"" for Hell, was a secondary plot line. It was, for a while, seemingly forgotten once the key to Hell was handed over to Dream, but Gaiman did not forget about it, and the conclusion to that was even more satisfying, in my opinion, than the conclusion to the main story. I was glad that Nada was not forgotten in all the distractions.I know that there is more to Season of Mists than I've gotten out of it, but I've only read it once and, like the other books in The Sandman, it is one that must be read multiple times in order to be fully appreciated. It is also a book I hope to return to sometime in the future",1
"There's a lot to like about this book.  It's a quick read with a strong message you can't miss.  By learning about the 3 levels of forgiveness and the steps to achieving them you'll be able to get rid of your grievance story (which the author claims everyone has) that is holding you back most in life.  There are even some health benefits like lowering blood pressure and stress levels.  The thing I liked about it was the author didn't just say, ""Hey, you need to forgive people"" - True, I learned that as a kid.  But he gives the specific steps he used to teach the group that went through his clinical study how to forgive.  The author gives 10 Principles of Forgiveness.  Here are the first five:1. Accept that life is not fair and that others may play by a different set of rules than you do. 2. Stop blaming others for your circumstances.3. Understand that you cannot change the person who hurt you; you can only change yourself. 4. Acknowledge the anger and hurt that some unpleasant or even harmful even is causing you.5. Reframe your story of hurt--your ""grievance story""--by placing the hurtful events in a broader context than your current point of view.There are five more principles, but you get the idea.  The new clinical research the author did for the book seems to have paid off.  The steps he suggests can be a painful (you have to review things that make you angry), but the results are powerful.  Overall, it's probably one of the most useful books on forgiveness around.  Other good reads on the topic are Lewis Smedes book called ""Forgive & Forget"" and Redford Williams book called ""Anger Kills"".  But the clinical study behind this book makes it stand out.Finally, if you're thinking of buying this book you might like to know that the author gives some exercises / activities at the end of each chapter.  Some are better than others.  I liked the Anger Test from chapter 3 and the Grievance Story Toxicity assessment from chapter 5.  The author even gives an amusing parable about forgiveness at the beginning of the book called ""Drop the Rock"".One more thing, there's a discussion guide in the back of the book.  For each chapter there are 8-10 questions that could be used to get people talking about the things covered in the chapter.  Probably a useful tool if you run a support group or some other kind of small group.",1

"It's still classic.  This album holds the test of time.  I bought in 95, at Christmas, and its still hittin.  For the first time, outside of Outkast, and the dungeon family, I have never heard some southern rap that doesn't have that typical southern sound.  Eightball & MJG, make an album that is funked out with spritual lyrics, (that is not in ABC fashion or gettin' crunk), that really hits the listener.  Track #2 the pimp anthem, ""Pimp in my own Rhyme"", has 8ball comin out hard and tellin these hoes just how it is.  Example:  ""F*ck being your boyfriend, girl I wanna hit dem boots/ jump deep in that rump/ and then I gotta fly B!tch/ you should've known how a real playa acts/ that's why I be/ about my P's/ and Q's/ cause hoes end up being bad news.That is classic hotness!!!!On the Afrocentric banger, ""In the Line of Duty"", MJG delivers fiyah like this:""Everytime I breathes/ everytime I talks/ I'm always being heard/ or even being watched/ by scary @$$ white folks and crooked @$$ cops.""  That is a classic banger that deals with the police.""What do you see"" is another classic banger.  8ball once again delivers the extremely witty wordplay saying:""Crews come 2's and 3's but they all 4's/enemies of me and MJG's tight flows"".As far as production.  It's superior.  It has a down-south pimp feel to it and no beat on there is wack, or sampled.  Everything is original.They also recive guest shots from E-40, Big MIke, Mac Mall, and others.  This is also one of the first cd's I've ever bought that fills up 74 minutes, that is quality.  Nowadays an album that long ain't quality, but this one is still timeless, and it still delivers, even after 10 years, but it was also made during the second golden age of hip-hop.  That's just a few of the bangers that's on the album.  This is also the cd with ""Space Age Pimpin'"".  That song brought the duo more recongnition, and its probably when most people got hip to them.All in all, if you want a southern rap album that has tight funked out southern beats, real flow about real life, this is it.It's still superior, so please, please, if you can find it, go cop it!Peace!!!!!!!!!!",0
"Snowflake Bentley tells the delightful story of Wilson Bentley, a man who spent his entire life photographing snowflakes. He lived in Vermont his whole life, a place where snow is as common as dirt, but yet, he was still able to see its marvelous beauty. Children will love reading this book about a topic everyone finds pleasure in, plus they will be inspired by the life of Snowflake Bentley.The format of this book makes it an excellent read for a wide range of age groups. A younger reader will love having the story read to them and eventually reading themselves the text that goes along with the pictures. However, on the side of nearly every page is a portion of more factual information that older readers will love digging into. It gives a more detailed look into Bentley's life and describes the technical aspect of snowflake photography.The illustrations are another neat part about this book. Mary Azarian uses woodcuts to illustrate the text. This is a little more unusual style than children might be used to, but they will very much enjoy it. The pictures are all greatly detailed, making it easy for children to follow along with the story just by looking at the illustrations. They do a beautiful job of depicting nature, which is what Bentley loved most.Another great thing about this book is the inspiration that children will gain after reading it. Wilson Bentley was a man who truly had a passion for nature, so he dedicated his entire life to doing what he loved. He is a great example for children to look up to, as they are beginning to discover things they have a passion for. His life story may encourage children to dig deeper into something they love or even follow in Bentley's footsteps",1

I bought this on sale about 12 years ago. I've had people borrow it and I've had to go get it back. I will not let this one go. It is an excellent workout book.

"This is such an excellent book.  My only fear is that many people do not realize that dieting can cause eating disorders and that's why I wish the book was also in the Health/Diet section of the stores.  However it is NOT a diet book, but teaches us to eat naturally and normally and how to loose weight and keep it off by loving ourselves.  However it is much more than that still.  It helped me realize that my body is unique and may not conform to the cultural ideal.  Thank God for this book",1
"For a long time I searched for information about Russian quilt history. I gave up when I went to St. Petersburg, Russia and could only find new publications on how to make a modern quilt. I was very glad to see in this book the quilt made by a Russian lady. I was glad to find that it was made of fabrics of used garments of loved ones. It affirmed my conviction that women everywhere will make something beautiful of whatever they have. Russia is a very large and cold nation there must be other quilts stories. I would like to hear the stories and see the quilts. ",1
"This book is especially good for those who want to get a good grounding on the subject. Mr. Garaudy does not condemn the entire Jewish community. He concentrates on the real culprits; the Zionists. One should also read Israel Shahak's books, as well as Alfred Koestler's on the ""Thirteenth Tribe"" and you will have a fairly complete picture as to why Jews in general and the Zionists in particular were not very popular in the past or now. I have noticed an annoying trend when a Jew reviews books by author such as Israel Shahak. Those reviewers almost always refer to the author as ""self-hating Jews"". How unfortunate that they don't have a better argument! What the Israelis are doing to the Palestinians now violates the old maxim that two wrongs don't make a right. What the Nazis did was certainly wrong and you would think that Ariel Sharon and his fellow thugs would feel some guilt about what they are perpetrating now. This is the main theme of Mr. Garaudy's fine book, one that every thinking American should read for the other side of the story",1

"This book is a very helpful reference.  If someone has writer's block, this book will get them moving forward again.  It contains many frequently used (and some less frequently used) words and, unlike thesauruses, gives information about words/synonyms so that the most appropriate one can be discovered.  The index in the back of the book helps to find the page the word is on.  I have quite a few thesaurus-like books and this one I use most often.",1
"This book was such a ride!  Since I grew up watching Agent 99 on Get Smart, as a kid, reading her book felt very intimate.  I just kept thinking, ""NOT AGENT 99!,"" as I read about the ups and downs in her personal and love life.  Yet, it isn't a celebrity expose.  Her words are meant to inspire and go beyond the shallow genre of gossip.  You really do forget that this woman was a television icon because she is very down to earth and generous in spirit.  As many other readers here have shared, I could not put this book down.  I found it inspiring and helpful.  Excellent!!",1

"This is a well written, informative and even enjoyable book to read on what is in many ways a difficult subject for people. The author discusses the psychological, physiological, and social factors surrounding bipolar disorders and depression and discusses current treatments and how they work. The book is full of a tremendous amount of practical information that should be of use to anyone concerned with this subject.I myself studied the neurobiology and psychology of emotion and moods in grad school, and I thought I'd make a few more comments there, since we're on the subject, in case anyone finds them useful.As many people are aware, much of the research up to this point on mood disorders has focused on the serotonin and dopaminergic issues, especially since these chemicals have a profound influence on the limbic system areas and the areas they connect with, such as the temporal, frontal, and prefrontal cortex, which are responsible for emotional behavior and many aspects of personality. It is well established that chemical imbalances and/or damage, such as through trauma and stroke and so on, can cause various syndromes, ranging from mood and emotional disorders to cognitive deficiencies. We still have a lot to learn about all this, but the basic chemical pathways, neurophysiology, and neuroanatomy has been worked out pretty well at this point. We'll be able to make more specific correlations as further progress is made. For example, deficits in long-term motivation (which many people have) have been found to be associated with the nerve pathways connecting the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system. Some of this research may even be relevant to issues relating to schizophrenia and even the problem of consciousness itself. For example one thing that has become clear in recent decades is that what we call ""consciousness"" actually results from the integration of separate and diverse brain areas whose functions have to be coordinated in time in order for consciousness to occur,  and that when this integration becomes impaired, there are problems. It has been suggested that this by itself could be responsible for schizophrenia. Of course, it remains to be seen if can be treated some way, but again, our understanding of the possible mechanism is continuing to progress. Another fascinating study I read relating to another aspect of emotional behavior was the finding that 70% of death-row inmates have been found to have abnormal EEGs and brain waves emanating from the amygdala, a structure in that primitive and often nefarious region of our brains known as the limbic system, wherein many of our most basic motivations, drives and needs are controlled--both good and bad. The amygdala is well known to be involved in aggressive and even homicidal behavior. In one famous case, a formerly quiet, unassuming man developed an amygdalar tumor and went up a tower at the Univ. of Texas back in the early 60s and shot 17 people and wounded 30 others before he was stopped. There are now drugs that treat abnormal electrical activity in the brain, and the hope is that someday they may even be able to detect and prevent situations like this.  For a another fascinating example, take homosexuality, which many people still think is a form of psychopathology. Freud said it was because the boy didn't have a strong father figure, and so doesn't know better. For years homosexuals were treated with psychoanalysis with no effect. Then about 20 years ago, a scientist at Caltech made the amazing discovery that heterosexuals and homosexuals had different neurochemical and anatomical characteristics in one of the limbic areas known as the neurosecretory zone of the preoptic hypothalamic nucleus. In fact, he was able to get animals to display either heterosexual or homosexual behavior by diffusing neurosynaptic chemicals into the preoptic area. So much for the Freudian theory. This research proves that this aspect of our behavior is due entirely to how are brains are wired from birth, and has nothing to do with old notions of psychopathology. Finally, one of the most fascinating cases I came across was a number of people who had been perfectly normal, but had recently become almost complete ""vegetables"" and had to be hospitalized. At least so they seemed on the surface. There was nothing wrong with them cognitively, they still had normal reasoning ability and could talk and socialize if they wanted to. They just had no interest in it. They progressively lost interest in their famlies, jobs, friends, everything, and eventually had to be hospitalized. Finally, it was discovered that these people had amazingly developed an epileptic seizure focus in the orgasm center in the brain. It's been a while since I read the article, but if I remember right, it had the tongue-twisting name of the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis. In any case, it was in one of the somatosensory processing areas in the thalamus, which is a structure just below the cortex but above the limbic system. Although this is technically a form of epilepsy, there are no convulsions associated with this syndrome (just as there aren't in the case of temporal-lobe epilepsy, which, since it occurs in the memory and associational area of the brain, produces intense visions and memories). Now it was obvious why these people weren't interested in anything else in their lives. They had orgasms that went on for several minutes, and due to the intensity of the electrical discharge, were probably 10 to 100 times as intense as a normal person's orgasms. And they kept having them. Especially the women patients said it was better than anything they could experience before. So they just sat there, waiting, yearning, hoping, for that next ""seizure."" Of course, these people don't want to be cured. As for me, I want to know how I can sign up. :-) Anyway, just a few interesting things to consider relating to our knowledge of the brain and behavior. I realize I departed somewhat from the original focus of mood and emotional disorders, but perhaps you'll find my comments about other areas of the mind and brain informative or at least interesting",1
"I've own my X3 for about 2 years now and overall, it has been used to make one double espresso daily. So when it stopped working a month ago, I was heartbroken. Called FF, after some back and forth I sent the machine in for repair. The cost of repairing it is about $200, incl. the shipping. Add that to the $499 I paid for it and this turns out to be one very expensive machine. After several days of back and forth with customer service, I still don't know what exactly is not working in my machine. Apparently, there are 3 items that have failed, one being the thermostat, a washer and something else, that CS was unable to explain. I really liked the machine when it was working, so I gave it some serious thought of shelling for repair, but at the end decided against it - I rather purchase a new Rancilio Silvia.When I called the CS with me decision and asked them to send the machine back, I was told that on top of the $12 shipping there will be a $13 handling charge for packaging the machine. I refused to pay that and the rep turned outright nasty. Long story short, I finally got them to send the machine back with just a shipping charge, but that was one very unpleasant experience. It is a whole another issue what additional damage they might have done to my machine after the nasty fight I had with them.I really liked the X3 when it was working, and I would love to have it back, but it is just not cost effective at all. What is really confusing to me is that with the low usage my machine had and the maintenance I provided, it has 3 parts needing replacement - if this was a good quality machine, it should have worked a lot longer without any problems.

"I can't find enough words to praise Jeremy Seal's book. Not only is the concept brilliant--a journey around the world to confront his own personal fear of snakes--but his prose is absolutely breathtaking. He weaves stories throughout the book and revisits each story as it moves along toward a conclusion.  There is just the right mixture of quasi-fiction (the American story) and travelogue.   His mastery of innuendo, description, detail, etc., is at the &quot;10&quot; level. I'm looking forward to reading everything this man writes",1

"I was in this thrift store called Trash about 45 minutes away from my home and I was browsing through the vinyl they had there, me being kind of a newfound record collector. I had heard about Slint for a long time, and how Spiderland was a great experimental/alternative rock album, and how it was essential. The guy who worked there told me that Spiderland was one of the greatest albums ever, and told me to buy it. So I did. I might've listened to Slint half-heartedly in the past, as well as other bands like June of 44, but then I learned that David Pajo (ex-Tortoise, ex-Zwan - both bands I like) was in it and that made me curious about this album, since I liked Tortoise's ""Millions Now Living..."" LP so much. When I put on this album, it immediately sucked me in. An aspiring composer, I felt that Slint's style of odd time signatures, heavy cruching guitars, and cryptic vocals/lyrics were the sound I was always kind of looking for. They amalgamated punk rock's energy without being purist or too simplistic, and prog's knack for odd tiem signatures and extended song lengths without being at all pretentious. The record itself has an enigma to it, from the black & white cover of four men in the water, from its interesting song titles (""Nosferatu Man,"" ""Good Morning Captain,"" ""Don Aman,"" ""Breadcrumb trail,"" ""For Dinner,"" ""Washer"" - I know they're not in order!), from how it sounded. I remember the opening to ""Don Aman"" and how it made me feel. Just a soft yet unsettling voice saying ""Don stepped outside..."" and the eeriest guitar chords coming out shortly after. Very rarely can a song just reach out and grab you like that one did for me. The lyrics have a certain enigma of them, exploring human emotions and romance in bizarre and ambiguous ways that only a few can do, despite the fact that a lot of the lyrics aren't that audible. Spiderland is one of those albums you have to spin a numerous amount of times before all of its subtleties and elements can be revealed. Sadly, Spiderland doesn't get as much credit as it deserves, but it stands as a magum opus for those who have discovered it and given it their undivided attention",0

The second time read it with a highlighter and taking copious notes.The one thing that guy neglects to include in this post-boom tome is: where can potential entrepreneurs meet investors and venture capitalists? Everyone says don't send in business plans blind, they will not be reviewed seriously. ""Get an introduction to the investor before you pitch."" I have to believe investors do not attend regular networking/business events shopping for ideas. They would be mobbed like Clay Aiken at a middle school pep rally. Perhaps they attend undercover, but I have doubts about this too. So, Guy, if you're reading this, maybe you could tell us budding entrepreneurs how to get an audience with a busy investor like you",1

He showed that many of the detainees were the unlikely ones at the wrong time at the wrong place being rounded and ended up at Camp Delta.  The torture on these 'suspects' may make a sharp contrast to American Constitution of all  men are created equal, due process, human rights and rule of laws.  Why it happened in the country with such high moral ground?  Do we hear the born-again call for turning the other cheek?	This book will answer why the President justify the camp and technique for protecting the American people",1
"I am sorry to say that I never heard of Del McCoury until a few days ago.  I heard the band live for the first time at the Down from the Mountain concert tour and was absolutely stopped cold by their extraordinary musical ability.  I bought &quot;Del &amp; the Boys&quot; before the concert was over (and so did the guy standing behind me) even though I knew I was paying more than I had to, and I haven't been disappointed.  There are some real gems on this album -- particularly &quot;All Aboard,&quot; &quot;Recovering Pharisee&quot; (what a great lyric line) and &quot;Goldbrickin&quot; (note the Celtic opening)-- as well as 1952 Vincent Black Lightning.  This is a real American sound.  What great music",0
"I wrote reviews for both the He-Man ""Best Of"" collection DVD, and the Season One, Volume 1 DVD, which were fantastic. I'll be stopping off on the way home from work tonight to pick up my Season One, Volume 2 DVD...and, call me a dork, I can't wait. Yes, I'm years removed from being that 12-year-old kid who flew off the bus after school to park his fat little butt on the chair religiously every day to watch ""He-Man and the Masters Of The Universe"". But, as the years go by, the memories fade, and thanks to the majesty of DVD, we can go back in time and enjoy guilty pleasures such as this wonderful show that consumed so much of my life.Some of my favorite episodes are on this DVD collection, most of which I have not seen since at least 1985. And, like what I experienced during my viewing of Volume 1, the memories will come flying back. It was so cool watching these episodes, and somehow remembering what happens. Once you hear that music, it's like being transported back to your youth. Isn't that alone worth the money? The treatment that this show has received in these DVD releases is nothing short of fantastic. From the DVD's themselves, to the artwork that they are packaged in. It's like 1983 all over again. Ohhh yes, my wife will ridicule and laugh at me for sitting around content, on my same fat butt, watching these episodes. But I don't care. Let her laugh. I'm enjoying myself. By all means, if you ever enjoyed this show, pick up these DVD's. I guarantee you will not be disappointed",0
This cd is incredible.  I love their style and the vocals are superb! I will continue to purchase more of their music.,0
Yes! This CD is a winner!! Cannot beat the harmony of the Statler Brothers and there were plenty of selections for wonderful listening. Buy it!,0
"Segre's style on physics is straight forward and non-intimidating.  But what make this book is his stories. Emilio met and worked with many of these men.  He describes their personalities attitudes and politics, and they come alive in his book.  This is history the way it ought to be taught. Squisito!  Bravo!  Bravisimo",1
"     Perhaps Fischer's greatest achievment here is in how much he tells us in so short a book.  He covers Nazi and German history from the 19th century to 1945 in under 600 pages!!  He shows a special gift for writing the most with the (relatively) fewest words.  Even those knowing much about the subject will learn a lot from this volume.  And Fischer knows what should and should not be included in a book of this kind.  This work will be a valuable addition to any historical library.     I particularly enjoyed the section on the Weimer Republic and the 20's.  Most books skip over this period, saying only that the Republic was democratic and flawed, and that Hitler sought to destroy it.  Fischer gives us an in depth look at this society, and explains how its insecurities contributed to the disaster to come.     I only wish the book had been a bit longer.  There is only so much one can include in a one volume work, I know, but a few hundred more pages would have made it truly outstanding",1
"Where do i begin? This is my favorite album of all-time. I have waited for years for this to come out on cd.The bonus tracks are amazing. Especially ""one of these days."" that song made me cry it is so powerful. The whole album is a rollercoaster ride between dance and ballads. It is an amazing experience. why don't todays artists make cd's like this? Barry is the king of live shows. BUY THIS CD",0
"-I'm not big on RPG's so I don't know much about the ""Final Fantasy"" games, but I do hear that the scores are largely excellent so I was a bit surprised when the game composer wasn't used and the great Elliot Goldenthal was brought in instead. Unlike the movie which is a beautiful disappointment, the score is fantastic and definitely one of the best from this very underrated composer that does not get the respect he deserves.-The best piece of music on the album and one of the best musical cues I've heard in my life is ""Race to Old New York"" which starts off with this fast moving strings that plays this simple melody, then shortly after the brass comes in and picks up the melody which keeps going to the short cue comes to it's natural resolution. I don't seem to remember hearing that cue in the movie which was a shame because it's so wonderful.-Other tracks that should make glad that you have ears are ""The Phantom Plains"", ""Dead Rain"", ""Code Red"", ""Music for Dialogues"", ""Winged Serpent"", ""Zeus Cannon"", and ""Adagio and Transfiguration"". I love how he blends the techno stuff with the orchestral elements in ""Dead Rain"" and ""Winged Serpent"" is just creepy as hell. ""Zeus Cannon"" is a majestic piece that sounds like the music that should accompany a Greek god. ""Music for Dialogues"" is a great piece that should be familiar territory for all Goldenthal fans. -There is an isolated track on the DVD which is great, but Goldenthal seems to have the same problem that great composer Marco Beltrami has, which is to talk over the music. Most of the cues he does talk over are on the album so it's not that big of a problem, although I do wish he would have actually talked for the scenes when there was no music. 10 minutes would pass by and we won't hear a peep from him, but he is a brilliant composer so I guess we can forgive his lack of great DVD commentaries. -Even if you find the movie to be a little disappointing, the score should keep you interested. It's fresh, it's great and gives birth to ""Race to Old New York"" which should be included in any filmmusic geek's top 50 of great musical cues of all time",0
This book is full of historical and factual material that is very helpful. The outlines are extra good and useable. The spritual insight is very challenging and preachable. The best commentary I have read on Genisus,1
This book is amazing. The writer takes a complex subject and makes it understandable and enjoyable. I found the links between cultures and tradtions to be fascinating--especially the geographic and plant connections between China and Appalachia. I can't wait for David's next book,1
"I really enjoyed this book and, not being a Grisham fan (AT ALL), this is really saying something.  I don't really care for courtroom dramas and my husband finally cajoled me into reading A Painted House by promising that there was not a single courtroom scene to be found.  And right he was.  This story was touching and fast-paced.  It was enjoyable along the same lines as To Kill a Mockingbird (the only courtroom story I've ever enjoyed) in its background and overall feel.  I didn't like the ending - not because it wasn't good and not because it didn't flow with the rest of the book (a lot of novel endings these days seem rushed and thrown together) but because it's not the way I wished it would go.  All-in-all a great book and highly recommendable",1
"In 1974, Duke Ellington died.  Miles Davis, as far removed as jazz can get from the swing of Ellington, went into the studio (a place he'd largely avoided recently) to record a tribute to the musician he loved.  That track (""He Loved Him Madly"") and a session a few months later augmented by some studio leftovers from the previous four years became what would be the last studio recording Miles would release before his retirement-- the double album ""Get Up With It"".The material from the two 1974 sessions is for me the highlight of the album.  Miles' working band featured no less than three guitarists (the underheralded genius Pete Cosey, Reggie Lucas, and Domique Gaumont), reedman Sonny Fortune, and longtime rhythm section Michael Henderson (electric bass), Al Foster (drums) and Mtume (percussion).  For ""He Loved Him Madly"", Miles used Dave Liebman, who had recently departed from the band, in place of Fortune.  That tune, an extended work, is among the most dense and difficult material Miles has recorded.  It is, not coincidentally among the most rewarding as well.  Davis sits at the organ for the majority of the piece, whih opens in a funereal mood, with Davis droning at the keys, the guitars gently churning a fractured pattern and a dirge-like snare pattern.  After a rather noticable edit around eleven minutes in, Liebman begins soloing, a delicate, gentle performance (on alto flute) where he takes time to develop the piece.  The rhythm section is nothing short of astounding, with Foster and Mtume gently prodding while Henderson is nothing short of jawdropping.  This is followed by a brief guitar solo and then an extended solo by Miles where he really pours his soul into his horn and is among the best performances by him on record.  After Miles completes his solo, several more brief ones follow, with the rhythm section picking up the tempo and becoming more insistent before a (albeit slightly sped up) reprise of the droning introduction closes the piece.  By the time its over, its nothing short of astounding.The other 1974 pieces, ""Maiysha"" and ""Mtume"", are similarly brilliant-- the former is a funky jam, with Miles alternating between trumpet and organ and a fantastic exposition of the theme-- organ hints at it, Fortune (on flute) states about half of it, then Miles reads it and briefly solos on trumpet.  Again, the rhythm section steals the show with Henderson, Foster and Mtume locked into a tight groove.  Just before the ten minute mark, it switches from into a totally different groove (if it's an edit, it's extraordinarily well executed), with scrambled up guitar playing and a funky guitar lead that defies description.  ""Mtume"" is much more vamp-oriented, with both guitarists (Gaumont was not yet in Miles' band), Henderson, Foster, and Mtume all holding the vamp with occasional breaks, usually triggered arhythmically by Miles on organ.  About five minutes in, the vamp is broken by Miles on horn stating the theme before the vamp resumes.  Things shake up for Miles's solo, not one of his more inspired on the record-- it's decent enough but he played much better.  But around ten minutes, Miles returns to the theme and Cosey plays a solo that gets deep inside the groove and never looks back.The leftover material from other sessions is actually all quite good as well-- Miles hadn't released much studio material at this point, so there wasn't a lot out there and these weren't really ""leftovers"" in the usual sense.  The oldest piece, ""Honky Tonk"" dates from 1970, whereas ""Calypso Frelimo"" is as recent as 1973.  As one would expect, ""Calypso Frelimo"" is the most similar in mood and sound to the later '74 material-- an extended work, it begins with a funky bass vamp and a blistering trumpet solo.  Eventually guest John Stubblefield plays a ferocious soprano sax solo which Miles plays a fine counterpoint to before the piece abruptly cools off into a laid back groove over which Liebman (on flute) and Miles both take lovely, slowly developing solos.  The piece picks up as Cosey starts experimenting on his guitar and Mtume and Foster become more busy over Henderson's constant vamping.  Eventually, Cosey and Lucas lay down funky muted wah lines and Miles resumes his intensity from the beginning of the piece.  Most amazing is that after over half an hour, you wish the piece would keep going.The 1970 piece, ""Honky Tonk"", fits in quite a bit better than you'd expect.  Driven by fractured lines from John McLaughlin (guitar), Herbie Hancock (clavinet) and Keith Jarrett (Rhodes), the three eventually state a theme together when Miles rips off a brilliant, funky, bluesy solo with McLaughlin providing a stunning counterpoint.  The piece fades out after just under six minutes-- entirely too early.  Contrasting nicely is 1972's ""Rated X""-- featuring no horn playing, its a propolsive, percussion-driven piece with Badal Roy's tabla and Airto Moreira's percussion settling nicely in opposition Foster's aggressive beat.  The most interesting vehicle involves the band cutting off while Miles sustains organ lines and the band tumbling back in.  Album closer ""Billy Preston"", from the end of 1972, fits in quite a bit less-- its got a brighter production to its sound and its a lot looser and more open.  Miles plays well enough, but the piece's lack of density makes it hard to consider it in context of the album.Still as odd as ""Billy Preston"" is, it's not the engima of the album-- that title goes to early 1972's ""Red China Blues""-- a pretty much straightforward blues number featuring studio aces Cornell Dupree (guitar) and Bernard Purdie (drums), Miles solos on a wah-wah trumpet on this piece.  But with everything else being vamp driven and extended jams, to hear a straight blues form sounds totally out of place on the record.  It's actually really good, but it definitely doesn't belong.The 2000 reissue, at the time of release heralded as ""the recent reissue you were most likely to pay a small fortune for a Japanese release for five years ago"" (I did) has the crisp, clean sound that one expects from the Columbia reissues of Miles catalog and features detailed liner notes from saxaphonist/flautist Dave Liebman, who is featured on the two extended cuts.  Liebman takes the time to discuss not only his own feelings and recollections on the music, but also all the pieces from a technical and critical aspect and his essay is well worth the time to read.When I listen to ""Get Up With It"", I feel the album would have been a masterpiece had they not included the extra material-- it's not that any of this work is bad, on the contrary, it's all quite good, but it spoils the consistency of the album and makes it sound like a compilation.  Nonetheless, this is such enormously high quality material that I have a hard time giving it less than five stars.  This is not easy listening, and newcomers to Miles' '70s music are encouraged to start with ""Bitches' Brew"" and ""A Tribute to Jack Johnson"", then look towards ""On the Corner"".  But if ""On the Corner"" sits well with you, this is the next place to check",0

"My daughter LOVES this doll.  She is very durable, is beautiful, the wand of light is fun and colorful.  As any little girl does, she LOVES to change her dress often and role-play along with the movie.  Being that she is almost 4yrs old, having the ability to change the dress by herself easily was a bonus!I collected Barbie Dolls when I was young and the quality of this doll, the coloring in her skin, makeup, hair quality, dress quality is wonderful!

"I have only seen My Morning Jacket play twice, once at Bonnaroo, and they are by far, in my opinion, the best live band in the world.  I was hoping they would make a DVD so I can watch them play live whenever I want, and finally one day, after I was complaining to my girlfriend that they didn't have a live dvd, I saw on their website that they were going to release this.  I bought the Okonokos live album as well, and while I loved it, the DVD sounds 2x better.  Every instrument seems to stand out, and Jim James' vocals are outstanding.  It's nice to see their almost mythical live performance ability finally caught on video so anybody can see it.  I've watched this probably 5 times already, and I'm amazed every time at how great everything sounds.I'm seeing them this weekend in Indianapolis; can't wait.  This is a band so good live, it's hard to get that excited about seeing any other band",0
"I had the privilege of seeing Mr. Stewart perform this live in New York City several years ago.  It was an amazing experience - I walked out of there absolutely convinced that there were at least 40 people on stage with him even though he was alone.  This recorded version is wonderful because you have the magic of his voice which is all you really need.  Put this on, have some egg nog and decorate the tree",1

The book doesn't focus on difficult defense,  like the Kelsey Killing Defense at Bridge books.  It focuses on general principles, and signaling.  A nice touh is a number of different signaling methods are presented at the end of the book.  The reader can become familiar with what they may face, and decide what signals to use.Roots book on Declarer Play is a good beginner/intermediate level book.  His book on Conventions is excellent, despite not having all the newest conventions. ",1

"The Little Nugget was my first experience with PGW, and I've since gone on to read several more. More serious in its nature than any of the other Wodehouse's I've ever read, Nugget is still a hillarious story--if not more wistful in the romance section. Smooth Sam Fisher is possibly the most likable villain I have ever read--every section with him had me rolling. While this might not be the best place to start, this is still an excellent novel and a humorous, easy read",1
"Second best isn't bad when the #1 book changed forever the way software architecture is talked about.  GoF is not only well-written, but it covers all the basic, most-used patterns.  Everybody thereafter is going to have to either re-hash GoF, criticize it, or come up with new patterns which are not as fundamental.This book is full of new patterns, and fortunately they are good ones: Command, Broker, Layers and worth the price of the book in itself Presentation-Abstraction-Controller.PAC can be seen as a generalization and extension of Model/View/Controller.  The Abstraction is the domain-specific part of the architecture, effectively the Model.  The Presentation exposes the Model in some interesting way, either as a user-interface in which case it is a View, or as an API, in which case the Presentation becomes a new Abstraction used by the next level up.  The Controller is left with the job of coordinating the Presentation and the Model.  The key to the pattern is that PAC agents can be built up into layers with the Presentation API of each lower agent creating a higher abstraction for the next level.  Thus PAC becomes MVC for all or your architecture, not just the UI.The book goes into this at length and adds useful discussion of MVC.  Highly recommended",1

"""Over, Under, Sideways, Down"" or ""The Yardbirds"" or ""Roger the Engineer"" was the Yardbirds` first real album released in 1966. They had released two albums in America in 1965 ""For Your Love"" and ""Having a Rave Up"", but they were merely a compilations of singles, EP`s , live-recordings or obscure recording which were included to fill up the albums to reach an acceptable playing-time. For the first time they were given the opportunity to record a real album. The were not given unlimited studio-time; on the contrary; the album was recorded during a very short time-period; I believe it was about 2 weeks. This makes the result even more impressive. It`s no exaggeration to call this album one a the greatest of the mid-sixties. Very tight playing by everyone, impressive and innovative guitar-work from Jeff Beck, solid vocals and great songs. In my opinion there is no doubt that it`s Jeff Beck who makes the difference. I love the sounds he can get out of his guitar. It`s not difficult to imagine how he stunned people  listening to his guitar back in 66. The great mixture of traditional blues and the new psychedelic sounds has never been surpassed.Even classic 12 bar blues tracks like ""Lost Woman"",""Over, Under, Sideways, Down"", ""The Nazz Are Blue"", ""Rack My Mind"", ""Jeff`s Boogie"" and ""What Do You Want"" sounded (sounds) new; and these recordings still sound uplifting and full of energy today. On songs like ""Ever Since The World Began"", ""Turn Into Earth"", ""Hot House"" and ""Happenings Ten Years Time Ago"" showed a purer progressive side of the band. In fact ""Happenings Ten Years Time Ago"" was not originally included on the album, as it was recorded shortly after, at a time when Jimmy Page had also joined the group. ""Happenings Ten Years Time Ago"" was released as a single with ""Psycho Daisies"" as the b-side. These two songs have been featured on most re-releases of the album, and can almost be considered as originals. The moving ""Farewell"" is a another favourite; makes you think of the sad destiny of Keith Relf who died electrocuted in 1976 by his own guitar while practising at his home. Unfortunately this 2 lead-guitarist period would last very short, as Jeff Beck soon left. As far as I know, they only recorded 3 songs; with ""Stroll On"" from the movie ""Blow Up"" as the third. The bonus tracks make the CD an even better buy. The Keith Relf solo tracks a all solid; in fact they are really the Yardbirds backing singer Relf. ""Mr Zero"" is not far from later Yardbirds recordings like ""Little Soldier Boy"". If you`re even the least interested in the music that came out of the 1960`s this milestone is a must buy",0
"Mr. Keegan's style is great in the descrpition of the battles and providing appropiate maps for reference. My only complaint is that certain parts of invasion was negelected for other ones. For example,Mr. Keegan description of the US 101st and 82nd parachute drop at southern end of invasion beach was great, but their britsh counterparts got just a few paragraphs. In descrpition of the beach landings the Canadian beach got described but the American and British ones got a superficial survey.

Apart from ""Stuttering"" there's plenty of other material that makes one wish to sit in and be part of that audience. Nasheet Waits and Drew Gress are great throughout the recording. Last but not the least, the recording quality and mastering stands as an example of what a club live set recording should sound like",0

"Enough takes the formulaic made-for TV battered woman story and actually makes a big screen movie sillier than its cheesy small screen counterparts. Another entry into pseudo-feminist category, Enough is a hypocritical movie that preaches empowerment but constantly shows its heroine being objectified and degraded. I hope by reading this review you'll avoid this horrible movie.Enough follows Slim, a waitress working at a Seattle Diner. (Strange she won't identify herself with her real name but objectifies herself by calling herself a shape) We never learn about Slim or her goals in life, she's just a beautiful woman in need of rescuing from her dead-end job. At work She meets up with a Mitch, a handsome rich customer. He woos her; after only minutes of screen time they're in love. Her unassuming ""Nice Guy(tm)"" boss warns her that Mitch bet him that he could get her into bed. He has the hots for her, too but Mr. Insecure doesn't say anything outside of that passive-aggressive(tm) warning. Despite OBVIOUS WARNING SIGNS about Mitch's CHARACTER Slim continues dating him. Golddigger is just happy to have a rich man sweep her off her feet and save her.So Slim marries Mitch Charming and he decides to buy some guy's house just because he can. Oooh. POWER ISSUES. They have a child, but he won't let her hold her after giving BIRTH to her. Oooh. CONTROL ISSUES. Slim, distracted by Mitch's money can't see BIG RED FLAGS in front of her. It's not until five years later when she gets a call from another woman that she learns he's cheating on her. Instead of quietly taking money out of the joint account, and filing the divorce papers THEN, she confronts him. This leads to Mitch becoming abusive although he's never displayed this behavior previously. Psychology books say batterers have a PATTERN of behavior with women they date, but this movie follows Bizarro logic. He beats Slim down and slaps the kid around for good measure so we can hate him.Slim goes to the cops with a huge bruise on her face but decides to NOT have him arrested or take out a restraining order, fearing he'll take her daughter. She actually believes the malarkey a desk sergeant tells her about the legal system instead of consulting an attorney. Scared, she makes a run for it in the night. But Mitch thwarts her escape plans. After another beatdown, he menaces her adoptive Dad and friend with a gun saying they're trespassing. When she tries another run for it, he freezes her financial assets. So with borrowed money, Slim takes her daughter to a motel. There, Mitch makes a threatening call saying he's everywhere. You'd think after being beaten TWICE she'd keep a tape recorder on hand to record moments like this for EVIDENCE. Making TERRORISTIC THREATS over the phone is a FELONY. Mitch breaks open the hotel door and Slim has to escape. They head up to Seattle where her ""Nice Guy(tm)"" friend lets them stay with him and puts his passive(tm) moves on her. Cop friends of Mitch pose as FBI. They rough him up, knock down stuff and cut up a sofa. Stupid Mitch doesn't know that ""Nice Guy(tm)"" would be a WITNESS and these cops would be facing charges from IAB and FBI because Mitch's pockets aren't fat enough to protect them from FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS CHARGES. Yes, Mitch here was STUPID enough to cross STATE LINES to commit his crimes. But Slim never keeps a RECORD of these incidents for EVIDENCE. She goes to real dad in San Fran for help, but gets none. You'd THINK she'd go to a library and study those wonderful Federal and state laws on the books and would be preparing her case with prosecutors.Not wanting to endanger her friends, Slim heads to another city. Detroit, Orlando, they all somehow look Like San Francisco in this movie. Turns out Mitch has friends even in THIS city to help him do his dirty work. Mitch may be a rich, real estate guy, but I don't think anyone is THIS well connected. He coincidentally knows cops in EVERY city Slim goes to? Come on. The cop he enlists to help him is aware that he's committing a crime, but follows orders. Mitch makes more terroristic threats over the phone that Slim isn't smart enough to record for EVIDENCE. This leads to a silly car chase where Slim is SMART ENOUGH TO EVADE HIM ON ROADS SHE KNOWS BUT NOT SMART ENOUGH TO CALL 911 DURING THE CHASE. Terrified, Slim heads back to San Francisco. Dad now decides to help out with his money and connections.Under Daddy's protection, Slim decides to FINALLY get legal advice from an attorney. She also decides to become ""empowered"" by training to kick Mitch's butt. I'd rather see her train to kick his butt in court with all the evidence shown throughout the movie, but she decides two wrongs will make right. Committing First-degree murder is far more satisfying to her than seeing Mitch and his colleagues go to prison.Final act, Slim breaks into Mitch's house. She plants signal jammers and shuts out the lights. ""Empowered"" in her belly baring cleavage-exposing black spandex outfit she prepares to confront him. She throws down with Mitch in one of the stupidest fight scenes ever filmed. It's never smart for a woman to take a man on in a fistfight because: A MAN IS EIGHT TIMES STRONGER IN HIS UPPER BODY THAN A WOMAN. He could have KILLED Slim with ONE PUNCH. It happens all the time in real life. Seriously. But following the Bizarro logic of this movie, Slim not only beats the crap out of the s Mitch, she KILLS him. After committing murder, (a handwriting expert would have easily figured out her letters were forgeries during the investigation), Slim goes on to live happily ever after with her ""Nice Guy(tm)"" diner owner friend, not knowing that he's just like man she just murdered. (Read my review of The Last American Virgin to learn why ""Nice Guys(tm)"" are dangerous.)Like its contemporaries The Rich Man's Wife, Gang of Roses, and Catwoman in the Pseudo Feminist genre, Enough makes a mockery of feminism with its sexist message of ""empowerment."" The wrongheaded ideas in this movie tell women to overcome domestic violence with violence, not seek counseling to deal with the emotional trauma or plan a legal strategy. It's interesting to note like in those other mentioned movies, the more ""empowered"" Slim becomes, the less clothing she wears. We never get to see Slim's face during the movie, only her body parts. This segmenting of her body takes away from her humanity and prevents us from connecting with her emotionally.Production values on this movie are not ""Enough"" considering the talent. The poorly written screenplay has dialogue that comes from the first draft of a Learning Annex student. Scenes don't transition into each other smoothly leading to a disjointed uneven story.Plain and simple, the acting is downright wretched in this movie. Jennifer Lopez is horrible in the role of Slim. She plays her character with no emotion in most scenes and is over the top in others. Billy Campbell is ridiculous to watch as the batterer. He is a cartoon character who gets more over the top with each scene. Don't get ""Enough"" at all. Pick up the far superior Sleeping with the Enemy. ",0
"John Sedgwick has written a ""family memoir"" that encompasses six generations of his famous Boston Brahmin brood.  His decision to mine through letters, public records, diaries, and the like came after his own breakdown in 2000.  Very much wanting to make sense of his hypomania -- a mild form of manic depression -- he turned to his family history, which itself is intertwined with America's history.  And that's part of what makes this ""memoir"" so special.  Instead of a salacious confessional, the reader is taken on a personalized tour of the Revolution, Shays Rebellion, Black-White relations, and more, all viewed through real people in real time. His portrait of the dignified Mumbet, a freed female slave is priceless, as was her character.  The writing is at once eloquent and accessible. If I have one quibble, and it's a minor one, it's over Sedgwick's own story within the story.  His WASPY discretion allows only so much, so that we get a mere cursory picture of his struggles with his father, Minturn, a Groton gentleman of Old School manners whose emotional distance can not be bridged.  Perhaps Sedgwick has another memoir in him",1
"This trailer is absolutely perfect for my two-year-old daughter who is still a little young for her own bike, but wants to go on rides with Mom and Dad.  She has been enjoying it and even fell asleep in it a few times.  I recommend propping up pillows or towels next to your child if you think he/she may fall asleep.  If not, she's bent over in half!  I was surprised that I didn't really feel awkward or much extra weight behind me (and my daughter weighs at least 32 lbs.).  We live in a very flat area, so that must help.  We ordered an extra coupler from the company for Dad's bike, so it's easy for either of us to pull her.  We recently took our bikes and the trailer on a weekend trip, and I was pleased to see that set up and break down is pretty simple.  The trailer fit in the trunk easily.  I definitely recommend this trailer and am very happy I bought it",0
"Although this book is obviously not geared towards those undergoing heavy-duty classical music training, if you just want to learn what chord construction, chord progression, scales, and a little of what jazz and rock styles are all about, this is the book for you.  This is, hands down, the best theory book for the player who just wants to play an instrument well enough to jam with his/her friends or to learn and play songs from a fake book.  Even an accomplished musician who knows little about theory (and yes, those people do exist) can benefit from reading this plainly-written, enjoyable, and inexpensive little book",1
"I got this book. .and I was very suprised, that it is actually a very Brilliant book on the Demo scene (first volume covers C64 and Amiga - with PC and the rest in Volume 2). I could not put the book down, and it covers scenes outside of Europe (ie, America, Australia, Middle East, etc..). It is very well researched and written. I recommend this book to anyone interested in computer arts. Oh the memories. so many memories come flooding back. Cant wait till Volume 2 + ",1
Everytime we read this book we see something new.  The adorable pictures combined with great dialogue make this a top ten book in our opinion. ,1
"If you're hoping for that ""dishy,"" tell-all, spicy account of Tallulah's life, this ISN'T it!  That bio is still to be written.  This attempt at capturing the essence of the grande dame suffers from two fatal diseases:  tedium and barely tolerable--lethal combinations in any dose.  And, there are glaring errors of fact.  Someone fell asleep at the research table!  Better to view some of la Bankhead's films than try to wade through these waters.  Anyone got a Lifeboat?!!",1
"I have the VHS tape of this movie &amp; will continue to own it while this Goodtimes version of this great movie is on the shelf.  I have not watched this movie for the fact that Goodtimes will screw up a good movie with bad quality picture, sound, &amp; all around basics.  The movie itself is great to watch with Weller &amp; Elliott in the action scenes &amp; the story is just all in your face.  The only problem is this movie was not released by MCA Home Video, if it had been you would have a great movie on DVD instead of this blurred &amp; muffled sound version",0
"This book gives trainers and managers the broader skills and knowledge they need to provide solutions (beyond training) to improve workforce performance.  It is easy to read, practical, and has exercises and case studies to reinforce learning. Everyone on my team is reading - and using - it",1
"As an artist and beginning animator, I have found Muybridge's motion studies to be helpful in understanding how the body travels in time (animals and machines too) using time-lapse photography.  This book remains  current and comprehensive especially in light of the current digital  revolution's emphasis on special effects and eye candy.  Muybridge's work  is important because it goes to the roots of motion and reveals its  simplicity and beauty.  I highly recommend this fascinating book for those  with curious minds",1
"This is a landmark book about the greatest painter of all time.  To write a book about over-hyped painters (such as Cezanne or Picasso) is easy... simply rehash other books or take bits and pieces from the large resource pool of readily available information.  However, to write a book about a once-famous painter, whose existence is almost concealed from the world, is laborious.  In spite of this difficulty, Wissman has written the first biography of a great painter we almost know nothing about (except now).This book contains large format pictures and an easy-to-read and informative biography.  Highly recommended",1
These are awesome training pants! They hold one accident really well and are the trimmest training pants I've found. They look like real underwear. Great for when the child needs protection from occasional accidents. They are not as absorbent as a diaper so they should be used once the child is doing well with potty training,0
"By around 1910,according to Veywey, the Old Time College had been reinvented and the modern graduate school tacked  onto it. The three functions of the new hybrid were to be teaching, research, and public  service. This book is as scholarly and as delightful to read as Samuel  Eliot Morison's histories of Harvard",1
I really enjoyed this even though my expectations were not huge. I don't really read business books but this is much more like a novel. I would recommend highly,1
"This drive may be excellent.  I'll never know.  I have now gone through two of them.The first one let out a loud pop and started smoking after being connected to power.  It was plugged into a power strip that has no problems with any other equipment.  Thank goodness it didn't take my iMac down with it.Just received the replacement today.  It powered up for about ten seconds before turning off never to spin up again.  At least there was no explosion this time.At this point, I'm done with this drive.  I'll be looking into another brand",0
"This is the second best album the man with the sexiest voice alive has done. If you are in the mood and with someone you love, just put this on and float away into the ethers together. Yeah baby. Good stuf",0
"Lord of the Rings Trilogy Soundtrack is one of the best epic motion picture soundtracks ever created.  The musics bring the scenes from the movie whenever they are played.  The themes are well-made and give different emotions. One can quickly remember the scene of the Bridge of Khazad Dum, Lothlorien, Gondor - Minas Tirith, the Dark Riders, the Rohirin, Battle of Helm's Deep, or even the happy scenes of the Hobbits.  Each CD consists of at least one or two beautiful vocals of female voices.  All soundtracks are composed beautifully by the great composer Howard Shore.Disc 1 The Fellowship of the Ring - ""Concerning Hobbits"" gives you the happy the life of Hobbits, which I really adore.  ""The bridge of Khazad Dum"" gives you the frightening scenes of the deep of Moria, consisting of vocals of football players ""hoof...hoof"".  ""The Breaking of the Fellowship"" is emotional, featuring the voice of Edward Ross and choir boys.Disc 2 The Two Towers - The theme of the Rohirin is beautifully played, especially ""The Riders of Rohan"", ""The King of the Golden Hall"" and ""Helm's Deep.""  ""Evenstar"" is beautifully sung by Isabel Bayrakdarian, which includes the Elvish 'Teliach Ú i vethed nâ i onnad. Si boe ú-dhanna. Ae ú-esteli, esteliach nad' meaning 'This is not the end...it is the beginning.  You cannot falter now.  If you don't trust [this], trust nothing else.'  ""Forth Forlingas"" and ""Isengard Unleashed"" are very dramatic and are my favorites.Disc 3 The Return of the King - ""Minas Tirith"" and ""The White Tree"" brings the scenes of Gondor and the Minas Tirith city.  ""Steward of Gondor"" begins with the theme of Gondor and is very emotional with the lyrics sung by Billy Boyd. ""The Black Gate Opens"" has beautiful tunes of flutes and themes of the Fellowship in an emotional way - I love it!  ""Into the West"" by Annie Lennox is a beautiful and dramatic song that gives you the sense of ""the end of a journey"".I highly recommend this soundtrack set for the beautiful themes and songs it holds",0
"Like his last masterpiece ""The Prayer Cycle"", Jonathan Elias has successfully inspired thoughtful minds with his moving music and his companions' profound words on ""American River"".  This cd is a refreshing break from the superficial pop music we're constantly inundated with. He's created a great compilation of soft tracks and sweet words as this album satisfies the classical lovers' soul and the wandering heart.  The music suggests a long transformation down the river of our history to the end where we find rebirth and renewal.  What's also amazing about this album is that he's collaborated with such great artists, including the last ever recordings of Johnny Cash.  I recommend this cd to all- for inspiration or mere enjoyment.   When you get this cd, check out number 3 and 8.  Top tracks for sure",0
"While some hardcore collectors and professional critics have found some small points to pick at in this book, most reasonable collectors will find it to be just what it purports to be: A very good standard reference guide to one of our all time favorite toys G.I. Joe.  So find a comfortable chair, turn off the TV, flip open the book and get reacquainted with a old childhood friend G.I. Joe",1
"Only Seinfeld rivals All in the Family for the title of best sitcom ever. But given the time in wich AitF was made, it was certainly very courageous, and it has withstood the test of time very well.

"Great book!  Every person thinking of starting a flock should really read this book.  My husband and I went through the same antics with our sheep, chickens and goats.  Very truthful and easy reading.  It gave me a better understanding of what I put my family through starting a farm.  I really hope there will be a sequel",1
"Leslie Gerber's on the money with her comments above. A colossal set with incomparable HEARING (playing) by Starker. What a MUSICIAN, my gosh!!  Prelude of the First Suite gives IMMEDIATE peace-- it's overwhelming! the way Starker embodies the ends of phrases -- such patience!-- this is Bach eternal!  Where Fournier can move chapel into dance court, Starker makes no compromises- the metaphysical comes first!  The AIM sometimes less elegant, but pure temple Breathing once inside.  For me, the god Fournier makes everlasting Bach. I know this, still a part of me made conversion of some kind hearing the Truth of Starker's completely immediate Art in Prelude of the First suite!  I tell you, Suite freaks, if YOU havent heard this recording you need to. Wispelwey is bright and free, I know. Starker, however, is Religion without artifice. Check it for yourself.  I heard the Mercury recordings only once & they stunned me. I should listen again. Tough to imagine another recording exceeding the depth of pure musical intention embodied in this one, but there's nothing valedictorian in Starker's understanding. This is Pure Musical Art, & as good as it gets",0
"I have to admit that I did not want to like this book.  I had decided to stop feeding my ""you create your reality"" addiction and was tired of ""you create your reality"" gurus.  I was on the mailing list of a self-improvement author who was part of the joint venture marketing campaign for this book and I thought ""Here we go again..."".  I decided to wait until the price went down - but could not get the book out of my mind.  I finally broke down and purchased it - fully expecting to return it if it turned out to be another rehash or book length sales letter.  All I can say is - GET THIS BOOK!  The author offers the same metaphysical principles as other authors in this genre, BUT she describes WHY and HOW these principles work and gives specific, simple methods.  Her use of metaphors is unique and her examples make some time honored self-improvement methods crystal clear.  One of my personal favorites is her metaphor on negative thought forms.  She asks, ""If you had bits of garbage laying around your house in little clumps, would you just leave them there?""  If you have read it all - GET THIS BOOK.  If you are new to manifesting - GET THIS BOOK",1
I bought this book for my 14 year old son to read for his independent reading journal in English. He had seen the movie and loved it. He is hooked on the book now - hasn't missed an English reading journal yet,1
"I have been battling Multiple Sclerosis for years and I have read almost every book I have run into on the subject. This book is by far the best, for people who are unwilling to surrender to this disease. Brad Hamler clearly understands that it is possible to delay the immobility and other physical problems that MS can cause, by maintaining a focused exercise routine. I had come to the same conclusion myself and I was delighted to read the experiences of a medical service professional, with extensive experience with MS patients, confirming my strategy in battling this disease. I highly recommend this book to anyone with MS. A well focused excercise routine has been the most clearly effective therapy, of all the therapies I have tried. If you have MS, this book will show you how to fight back, and keep active and mobile. Eventually, medical science will develop therapies not requiring this much effort, but until then Brad has the best strategy to battle MS. Continue with whatever drug therapy you may be on, but add Brad's exercise routine to it",1
"Don Keith has captured the history as well as the personalities of the crew of the Batfish.  His writing style perfectly complements the events of her service during WWII and the remarkable but quirky way she wound up in Muskogee, OK. at War Memorial Park.  A fun read as well as an emotional one",1
Lucareelli from the first chapther grabs the readers attention and doesn't let go to the chilling ending. It not only is exciting murder thriller but also offers insight into cultural aspects of Modern day Italy.  A word of warning the novel isn't for the faint of heart. I still have trouble sleeping at night I keep waking imaging the killer is in my room,1
"I remember many of the examples in this book that created good and positive change. How just one small act makes a difference. Malcolm Gladwell offers simple and effective examples of how others have made a difference, and how you and I can too. I enjoyed reading this book and think it brings good solutions to people just at a time in our world when we could all really use them. This is a book I would suggest for anyone who would like to revive a spark inside to make a difference!",1
"For a short time I worked at a Florida lab helping to compile the USDA list of introduced arthropods.  It was then I learned about a lot of obscure creature that had invaded the US in ballast, on plants, in clothing, and on wood, rock, sand, and just about any commodity or personal effect.  The invasion has not stopped, but it is often not even known to be going on by the general public, except in some high profile invasions such as the Asian tiger mosquito!John Leland, in his ""Aliens in the Backyard: Plant and Animal Imports into America"" presents us with many (but certainly not all) of these imported organisms, from starlings to Russian thistle and from dogs (first brought in by Native Americans) to anthrax.  Some of these introductions changed history as they destroyed or interfered with crops, or were of medical importance.  Smallpox, unknown in America, was used to kill Native Americans long before anyone heard of a virus by transferring contaminated blankets to the intended victims.  Both diseases and destroyers of crops had their effects on armies and the outcomes of wars, as well as the physical and economic health of the hemisphere.Despite a few irritating typos, I found the book to be basically accurate and I learned a few things as well, such as the fact that all species of human lice were already present in the New World when Columbus landed.  Typhus may have been here as well.This is one of those eye-opening books that should be read by everyone, especially if you are concerned with security.  We don't need terrorists (although they can help things along) to cause major impacts on society.  Nature and our own mobility can do it as efficiently or even better!  We should also keep in mind that we, who evolved on the plains of Africa, are aliens to the New World as well!  Indeed, John Leland drives this point home several times in this book",1
"I have had this book for about a year and needless to say, I am not even on page 100.  Every time I have tried to read this book, it seems like I am reading about the authors experiences, rather than the experiences she has had with her daughter. It got so boring that I have to put it down.  Every time I pick it up, I forgot what was going on in the pages before. On a recent family trip in the car, I brought this book with me, with yet again, another attempt to TRY to read it and give it yet, another chance.  After only reading a few pages, I said to my husband and daughter, ""No matter how I try, I can't read this book!""  The author has taught me nothing about my tween, almost 12 years old.  I only read about HER (the author's) feelings and experiences about herself growing up and things that are happening with her, which hardly touched on the experiences she was having with her daughter or the interactions she has had with her daughter or any conflicts, hard times or happy times she has had with her daughter.  In my opinion, save your money or try to get it from the library.  I thought I was going to read a book about my tween in training, but the best training is going through the daily grinds and figuring it out yourself. There is no better training than to be with your own girl and her friends and being a part of their lives and trying to come down to their level, singing, being silly, and sitting on the floor eating popcorn with them.  Sorry",1
"Incredible. After ten long years the boys with the golden voices and beautiful souls have returned to fill the world with beautiful music once more. I would be lying if I said I wouldn't think it better to have all five of them together again but that is the way it goes sometimes. No ill will towards either camp. I adore them both. It makes a warm feeling in my heart to see my boys back in action, to know that there are new sounds to listen to. For those not familiar with thier music know that it is a combination of blended harmonies, romantic love songs, and smooth adult contemporary sounds. They have grown from the teenaged boyband and evolved. Now if I can just get them to release in America and to tour here. Le sigh.",0
"After finding Liz's first book ""Ready or Not...Here We Come"" so helpful with the first year, I'm so glad she's back with lots of real-life tips (and fun stories) about the toddler years with twins.

It's like having a big sister who has gone through the twins-thing just ahead of me",1

Lynda's book takes the fear out of home improvement and actually makes it fun!

"This is a deeply inspiring photographic account of Ruskin's commitment to Venice.

I purchased this book to help me plan my small apparel company.  The author Mary Gehlhar has practical realistic advice and knowledge to offer anyone on any scale interested in persuing a fashion design career.  My favorite is when she explains the money pit runway shows have become and the small return that they often generate most of the time.  The chapter on marketing is indespensible for any small designer who doesn't have promotion experiance.  I can't believe this wasn't on my textbook list for my apparel degree.  I must for anyone looking for a realistic reference especially on a small scale.,1
"Posner has been leading up to this book for a long time.  He attacks moral philosophy as being irrelevant for helping make important legal or any other kind of decision.  Instead he advocates a pragmatic, empirical approach.  To paraphrase  Jeffrey Rosen of the New Republic, if we lived in  a sane society, the Senate would beg Posner to be Chief Justice of the  Supreme Court.  Unfortunately, for our society, Posner has not only left a  long paper trail, but a paper super highway",1
"From the first page, I was drawn into the authors' vision for how loving communication and respect for each other's needs can transform families and enliven our relationships.

I love the resources and activities provided that are practical support for the many ideas the book offers for family connections",1

"It has been twenty years since Dr. Ballard discovered the Titanic. Since then he has gone on to explore the hulks of several famous sunken ships. The photographs he has brought back to the surface have been nothing less than astounding. But the limitations of underwater photography prevent broad panoramic views of the ships. In this book there is a combination of photographs (both pre and post sinking) and of brilliant paintings done from these photographs. Here are descriptions of these ships as they were built, as they sailed. Here also is the story of their sinking. Finally here is the story of how they look today, ghostly remains of what they once were. The photographs record two trips down to the Titanic, and visits to the Britannic, Lusitania, Empress of Ireland, Andrea Doria, Bismark and to the warships sunk in Iron Bottom Sound off of Guadalcanal. This is a beautiful book of what was",1

"I should have given it less than a five for the lack of character development as it exists in the book, but I give it a five because it gets the job done a different way.  I am not sure this is a stand alone film.  It requires having read Bowles, I believe, to appreciate it.  When I read the various reviews of this DVD, it is very easy to fine many nuggets of truth in each review.  This film delivered the sense of bleakness, hopelessness, despair that was prevalent during the post war period of many disillusioned with our world.  The film did, for me, with images what Bowles did with words, striking the same sensibilities through the eyes.  Frankly, I loved it and believe it or not, I will watch it again",0

"I'd have missed out on what was probably the most profound reading experience of my life.I read Percy's ""The Moviegoer"" a few years before I read ""The Second Coming.""  I appreciated Percy's craft, but wasn't particularly fond of ""Moviegoer.""  I, like most passionate readers, will devour all the works of an author when I find a new one I like.  Suffice it to say that ""Moviegoer"" didn't send me in search of the rest of the Walker Percy canon.Years later, I met someone (of whom I thought very highly) who recommended two books to me: ""Second Coming"" and ""A Confederacy of Dunces.""  I read Confederacy first (which was also fantastic) and then, somewhat reluctantly, picked up ""Second Coming.""  I think I fell in love before the end of the first chapter.  By the time I was finished, I knew this book was my soulmate.  I was also sad because I knew that it might be decades before I would ever read another book that would touch me as deeply as this book did.This story is a difficult one to do justice to in a brief description.  I know every inch of this book, as I read it at least once a year now.  If you enjoy an introspective, character-driven story, PLEASE read this book.  While it's not a romance, it's the most quiet yet compelling love story I've ever read.  Percy truly created the OPPOSITE of ""inevitable conflict"" (i.e. Blanche and Stanley in ""Streetcar""); Will and Allie are inevitably one.This novel is truly underread and underrated.  As a another reviewer wrote, I wish I could give this book far more than 5 stars.  If I had to spend 50 years on an island with one book, I'd be found on the beach with a dog-eared copy of ""The Second Coming.",1

"Something inside me resists calling Kenneth Koch my favorite poet.  His poems are too conversational, too easy-going, too entertaining to be so important.  Except the one that made me break out in laughter while I was reading it on a treadmill at Bally's.  And the one that made me cry (on that same treadmill, damn it!)  And the one that scared me--really scared me--because simply, lightly, even jokingly, it presented a truth I absolutely did not want to hear. . .Now that I think of it, I realize that without any special effort on my part, I formed the kind of relationship with Koch that folks back in the old country had with Yevtushenko, Bloch or Pushkin.  (Without any effort on my part, I say--all the effort was Koch's.)  Koch is dead now, of course.  But open the pages of this book, and he'll become a part of your life as well--as a friend, a teacher, a soulmate",1

He is one of a very few finest writers in our world today.  I returned to re-read this novel with an accomplished insight into his work.  It has been an astounding experience!  A novel of such breadth, imagination, and history unlike any I have read.  The chapter in which  an enormous stone is transported from the quarry to Mafra may be one of the most stunning I have experienced.  I have never been to Portugal nor possess much knowledge of it.  Jose Saramago has shown  me it's glory and his.  This is one of his best!",1

"The *Diamond Sutra* is a fundamental Zen text.  It is very brief, very subtle, full of the most profound wisdom.  I think it is the closest I have ever seen in words to approximating the absolutely ineffable truth of the  Dharma.  This is a wonderful translation.

"I love the traditional carols on this CD.  The Carol of the Bells is my favorite!!  I also love Silent Night which is one of my all time favorite Christmas carols.

It will definitely get rid of any ""BAH HUM BUG"" moods",0
"Slow reader that I am I thought it would take me a week or two to finish what turned out to be an absolutely astounding book...Time flew! Two days later (two 3 hr. rapid reading sessions; could not put it down!) I slumped over my reading table with my head on the book almost in tears feeling a sadness almost as purely as the writer must have felt herself.But there are also deep, rediculously hilarious gut laugh moments. Other funny happenings throughout the book could have been sad had Montgomery not have injected her classic ""oh well, let's just go with it"" attitude you find throughout the book.It's rare we can sit so on the edge of our seats despite knowing what ultimately is going to happen: her beloved father, the family anchor dies...but it is the living along the way that Montgomery celebrates.Thank you, Ms. Montgomery, foe allowing me -- a typical guy who keeps his emotions on the surface -- to explore a greater depth that has actually improved and help me cherish my relationship with those dear to me...while I can.            -Clay             Keene, New Hampshir",1

"This John Le Carre adaptation is almost as good as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, there's no legendary performances here but the screen play by Arthur Hopcraft and a strong cast make it a pleasurable viewing experience. The suspense and understanding the psychology of a spy builds through each episode and for such a slow paced film at times it really is surprising edge of the seat stuff. Just a quick note on Peter Egen, at first i had trouble not picturing him standing next to Richard Briers (Everdecreasing Circles) but once you get over this initial shock by the end you realise what good job he does for the part and that he is actually a rather splendid actor.",0

"Joy Electric is one of my top favorite artists, I really like the song ""The Most Terrible Archer"" on this album. I went to their concert in the december of 2005.

"The thing that surprises me most of these reviews is how displeased people seem to be with the ideal of how political this album is.  KMFDM has been and always will be a socio-political machine, driving the masses to question authority and the social definitions of what is right and wrong. Classic songs such as Rip the System, Disobedience, Glory, and many others are the embodiment of KMFDM's political spirit, and the name of the band itself is an abbreviation of a phrase in German translated, ""No Pity for the Majority.""  I find it more likely that they simply may not agree with KMFDM's particular view on the current global and American political environment, as many people are torn in their opinions and at this point in time, it's a very sensitive subject for many people.As for the quality of the music itself, Sascha and Company seem to have found the edge that they lost when En Esch and Guenter had split the project, and this release is immensly powerful and is reminscient of albums such as Angst and Nihil - hence a must for any KMFDM fan",0
Miss Chin's book of poetry is a work of art in the present day. Crisp images and the rhythms she establishes are a pleasure worth savoring. She manages to place one foot in the modern day American experience while still  working and moving in the tradition of Chinese verse. This weaving of  cultures is skillfully done. I could almost feel those ancient masters  nodding proudly over her accomplishments,1
"Software security is a continual process, requiring first an understanding of the issues. To be effective, this understanding and knowledge must then be incorporated into the software development lifecycle including design, coding, testing, and deployment. Several years ago I helped build a security analysis tool for Windows NT, called NtSpectre. We built the tool to analyze the security configuration of servers designed for an online game played for money. The game idea remained simply an idea, but our tool developed a nice cult following, and my understanding of the layers of security and their complexity grew considerably. This experience left me with one main philosophical and practical approach to softwaredevelopment, and software security specifically-test, neither assume nor guess.This book puts software security in its place, integral to your software development process. Whether you're agile, extreme, rational, or perhaps teetering at the top of a waterfall, this book will guide you in building security into your methodology. Theory and abstractions aside, Dr. McGraw concretely describes actual, and scarily common, security vulnerabilities he has encountered in the field. He goes on to show that security issues are inherently related to gaps in the development process, and expertly guides you to improvements in that process",1

"I read the book Tonight on the Titanic.  Jack and Annie went to the treehouse and met a dog that they named Teddy.  They needed four presents to free him from a spell.  They warped to the Titanic and there they got the first present just by being themselves.  Soon they heard the Titanic scrape something.  They soon find out it's an iceberg.  Nobody thought the Titanic was sinking at first, and Jack and Annie tried to save people because they knew it was sinking because they had traveled back in time.  They saved a big sister and a little brother who later gave them the first present for saving their lives.  I liked and recomend this book for three reasons. 1.It gives information about the Titanic. 2.They tried to save peoples' lives. 3.It's exiting and adventorous.It's great and I'd recomend it to anyone.

"This is a very good tale, and I found it extremely hard to put down.  The booked is based upon a long hidden diary of Anna Maria, a minor Polish Countess, along with a diary belonging to her wicked cousin Zophia.  The translations of these diaries are transformed into a fascinating tale of star crossed lovers, treachery, intrigue and a slice of Polish (and European) history I knew nothing about.  Throughout, Anna Maria is resiliant and survives much hardship to start a new life with Jan and her son.Highly recommended, this book should entertain any lover of historical fiction. ",1

"Thud! (2005) is the thirty-second Fantasy novel in the Discworld Series, following Going Postal.  This work is the sequel to Night Watch in the Ankh-Morpork City Watch subseries.  A Dwarf has been killed and the killer is presumed to be a Troll.  The Dwarves are keeping this information to themselves.  No others need be informed, especially not the City Watch.In this novel, Sam Vines, Duke and Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, is running short of sleep.   All the Watch is working overtime, especially Sam Vimes.  Koom Valley Day is coming and the usual animosity between the Dwarves and the Trolls is being spurred by the fiery speeches of Grag Hamcrusher, a Deep-down Dwarf.Koom Valley was the site of a famous battle between the Dwarves and the Trolls about a thousand years ago and has been the incentive for subsequent battles ever since.  Previously such battles have not directly effected Ankh-Morpork, but now tension is building within the city.The City Watch is being overworked, responding to individual fights and small battles, and the Day itself has yet to come.  The tension is also taking a toll on Watch personnel, for Dwarf and Troll constables are facing accusations of taking the enemy side in the upcoming fracas.  Only a few have resigned from the force so far, but the trend is becoming worrisome.Now the word is spreading about a Troll killing a Dwarf and not just any Dwarf, but Hamcrusher himself.  Captain Carrot brings the news to Sam Vines and the Watch Commander immediately sets out to discover the truth.  He takes an escort of four constables to pay a visit on Hamcrusher, whether alive or dead.He eventually talks his way into the building, faces the leader of these Dwarves, and gets him to admit that Hamcrusher is dead.  Sam insists on the Watch investigating the murder, for the only law in Ankh-Morpork is city law.  Ardent takes him to meet the grags deep down in the tunnels and they agree to let Captain Carrot be the smelter (to refine the truth from the falsehoods).Captain Carrot takes Sargeant Angua and Lance Constable Sally -- the new vampire constable -- with him to view the murder scene.  They find some evidence of a Troll at the site, but the Watch investigators suspect that these items have been planted.  But when they find a skull -- such as are being worn by macho Trolls -- and Angua smells a faint Troll scent, the accompanying Dwarves suddenly become anxious and very excited;  the Troll Alert is quickly passed to every Dwarf in the tunnels.  Maybe they hadn't really expected to find signs of a Troll at the murder scene?This story has the usual cast of characters, from Havelock Vetinari, Patrician of Ankh-Morpork, to Nobby Nobbs, certified human Corporal of the Watch, but it also includes some new Watch members.  Salacia Deloresista Aminta Trigestatra Zwldana Malifee . . . von Humpeding -- ""call me Sally"" -- is a vampire who has come to Ankh-Morpork to enlist in the Watch;  Sam Vimes reluctantly accepts her, although he really doesn't want a vampire in the Watch.  Vetinari, however, has his own agenda and Sam is out of excuses.  Sally turns out to be a good Watch officer, but she also engages in some suspicious activities.On the other hand, A. E. Pessimal is a government inspector who just wants to check out the paperwork and write his report, but he keeps sending Sam questions about the Watch practices and methods.  Sam finally volunteers him as a Special Constable for riot duty and takes him out to the barricades to introduce him to his fellow Specials.  When a Troll attacks Sam, Pessimal attaches himself to the Troll's leg with both hands and feet and tries to bite the Troll (not recommended since Trolls are not very soft).  Afterward, Pessimal finds himself strangely interested in becoming a regular Watch officer and Sam enlists him as a Lance Constable, assigned as adjutant to the commander.  Of course, he still has to complete the report for Vetinari, but he can rearrange the files at the same time.Sam Vimes has also taken on a special assignment of great importance:  every day at six PM, Sam reads Where's My Cow? to his infant son, Young Sam.  Nothing can interfere with this duty, for any good excuse soon lets in bad excuses and then Sam Senior may not be there when Young Sam needs him.  Young Sam soon learns to expect Sam Senior at exactly six o'clock -- he has a very precise internal clock -- and Sam Senior is afraid of what might happen if someday he is late or not there at all.BTW, Where's My Cow is available if you have a Young Sam.  It is 32 pages long and leads a merry chase looking for the cow.  Of course, you will learn most of the text in this novel, but the separate edition also has pictures!In this story, the question of who watches the watchers is evident throughout the story.  Sam Vimes watches the Watch, but who watches Sam?  To some extent, all the people around him serve to remind him of his duties, but something deep within Sam keeps him from abusing his office.Recommended for Pratchett fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of police work, social commentary and assorted zaniness.  If you haven't yet read this series, please start with The Color of Magic for the full effect.-Arthur W. Jordi",1

"Very interesting and informative book. Unlike the music he puts out, he doesn't make this book easily accessible to those outside of hiphop culture. He doesn't spoonfeed it for those who just don't get it. This is part history lesson and part real life illustration of how and why Russell makes the moves that he does. The ""purple suit"" money breakdown was one of the more clear examples of his outlook that I've ever read. Russell details how he navigates easily between the actual world of hiphop and the corporations that shape what hiphop means to the world.Real talk",1
"Whitehead's text is a masterful study in the art of clear and precise writing.  Introduction to Mathematics brilliantly revels to those of us with little or no mathematical skill or background the fascinating allure of mathematical thought.  Whitehead's exploration of the basic central themes of math is made concrete through his frequent use of simple mathematical examples yet the text never bogs down in pedantic detail.  Moreover, while the book is introductory in character, and therefore focused on fundamental rather than advanced areas of mathematical study, it is anything but small minded or condescending.  Rather, Whitehead electrifies the reader's mind by illuminating for him the profound insights behind even the simplest of mathematical operations.  Written with razor sharp clarity, this little gem of a volume is required reading for all those fuzzy-headed intellectuals who never understood math in school or how anyone could find the subject even remotely interesting.  If only Professor Whitehead had blessed us with a whole series of such volumes taking us by the hand and walking us in detail through the wondrous intellectual word of mat",1
"Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Its most common application is to style web pages written in HTML and XHTML, but the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including SVG and XUL. Thus CSS primarily enables the separation of document content written in HTML or a similar markup language from document presentation written in CSS. Thus, this book will be helpful if you are a web designer or document author interested in sophisticated page styling, improved accessibility, and saving time and effort. All you really need before starting the book is a decent knowledge of HTML 4.0, and the book covers everything else you need to know and has lots of examples. This book covers CSS2 and CSS2.1 up through the 11 April 2006 Working Draft. Some CSS3 selectors are also mentioned and covered. I found this to be a pretty good book for someone trying to learn CSS from scratch as well as someone seeking a good up-to-date reference on the subject. Particularly helpful is the Sample HTML 4 Style Sheet in Appendix C. Chapter one makes the case for CSS as bringing order to the chaos that web documents had sunk into by the year 2000, and the rest of the book mentions all of the aspects of CSS that you need to know to use the technology effectively. The following is the table of contents:Chapter 1. CSS and Documents Chapter 2. Selectors Chapter 3. Structure and the Cascade Chapter 4. Values and UnitsChapter 5. Fonts Chapter 6.

"This book was a disappointment despite very low expectations. Darwin Porter is not a writer, so this is not really a book; it's a deluge of catty gossip, incidents presented in no particular order and with little consideration for their relative value or who they pretend to describe. As another reveiwer said, one gets a far more meaningful sense of who Brando was by watching his flims, even the bad ones, because he was a fabulous and fascinating actor and always gave himself away in his performances. One doesn't need to read page after page of repititious detail about his supposed homosexual and straight affairs presented as actual accounts, with foolish dialogs that all sound the same. For example: would Brando ALWAYS refer to his prick as ""my noble tool""? It does not bother me particularly to think of Brando as a man who gave into his own cravings. And there are no real secrets about him if one watchs his films attentively. He was a generous actor. But the eye and heart of the beholder are what count in writing a biography- and this biographer's are on view here and are far less noble tools than those of his subject. And it does bother me that a publisher would accept a manuscript like this.The author grew up in acting circles, and knew some of the people he ""quotes,"" so these could be actual accounts, though it is extremely doubtful. But he had the responsibility to use discretion and intelligence when presenting the material for publication. He failed in this responsibilty and this became particularly painful and obvious when he threw into the book for no reason that I can discern a morgue shot of Marilyn Monroe, and various other painful images. Yes, we are all destined for this end, even the very loved, very kind, very noble, very wise and very discrete among us-  does anyone's privacy need to be violated in distress or death?No, it is not a book. But I thought I wanted information about Marlon Brando that I could not get on the internet, and did not find in his own autobiography (which I liked very much) or another cheap star bio I read, or from seeing hin in about fifteen films, so I bought it. Brando was the first to say that we are foolish to waste our time with actors, that actors are just people, no different than anyone else. If it was proof of mortality, and of that equality under the sun of which he spoke, I got it. I knew before I opened it that Brando, the man who lived and breathed behind the image on screen, is dead, and there is no more of him to be had, no matter where one looks. The one thing which was put into clear focus was the entire Hollywood scene, and the book really demonstrated why so many people in its orbit crack up. Since they are all just people, how can any of them survive this bitter, jealous, senseless, rivalry- filled world? It sounds like an upper region of hell.Better to inspect one's own fascination for clues as to its origin than read books like this, but who knows, maybe it helps to go all the way with it. That's why I give this book the one star- it did provide me a glimpse of the empty ground at the bottom of the pit.The book really decays when it gets to the end of Brando's life- it just ceases even pretending to be a real biography somewhere in the sixties, though it's hard to tell from the jumbled way everything is dumped onto the page. The last years are presented in a few pages, divided into boxes with a photo for each, and  that is how the era covering the making of such films as Last Tango in Paris, the Godfather, Miissouri Breaks is covered. There is no more information on Brando's solitude or real quality as a human being after he failed the great American public and ceased to entertain its regard- save a dim photo of the sad fat star in his underwear at a window, which is saved for the end like a treasure. At that point in the book there is a perfunctory stab at dealing with Brando's children's lives: this is not good to read because it is terribly painful. It is not put in perspective, since the author has only got his own perspective to put to it, which is that of a tattler.  That offers little solace when reading about the most terrible things which could happen to a person-to see his own children suffer and know that the blame is partly his own, and all of this in the relentless spotlight of fame.I am reading a good biography by Hayden Herrara of the painter Arshile Gorky. I recommend that one, even if you are not interested in painting. It might be good to have something on hand to cleanse your palate, if you are thinking of reading Brando Unzipped, for afterwards. You'll need it, and a lot of fresh air, maybe a shower and some good conversatin with a real person. Why would someone write about a person they neither respect, understand or love? Why would someone buy a book knowing it will be bad? These are questions to ponder as you visit Amazon",1

"That's all it took: 5 minutes. I got this little stick of RAM in the mail, opened the package, popped it out, popped off the side of my system, popped out the two old 256MB sticks, popped in the new 1G stick, popped the side of my case back on, plugged everything back in, and pushed the case back into its place next to my desk. Unplugging and replugging everything into the back was more of a pain and took way longer than actually installing the card, and it took no work at all once it was in. My system automatically recognized the boost from the very first start, and now, it's running like a dream! For the small cost, relatively speaking, and the minimal amount of effort it took to install, I'm wishing I would've upgraded a long time ago. For those of you who are afraid to upgrade the RAM on their system because you're afraid to crack open your system and tinker around, just remember to ground yourself (so you don't discharge a bunch of static electricity into a sensitive component), and make sure you put the card in the same way as the old one(s)....then again, you don't even need to worry about that last part, because it won't let you put it in backwards. So, if you want to inject an old system with some fresh speed for a pretty small cost, get this card, plug it in, and proceed to be amazed. ",0
I am an avid reader of this venue of books and this book rates the highest with me for its objectivity and thorough research into the story it renders.

"In this insightful novel that takes place after the loss of the land the Barnes family has farmed for six generations, Vinita Hampton Wright touches that most basic human predicament, known as far back as the first parents and homesteaders, Adam and Eve. Griefs come to us all --- as universally and yet as personally as fingerprints.Though written in third, not first, person, the story unfolds from alternating viewpoints of four of the five Barnes family members. There's Rita, a widow who has moved off what's left of the farm and into town --- that being the fictitious Beulah, Iowa, not far from Oskaloosa. She's a good Christian woman, who every Monday ""scavenges the produce that is beyond selling at regular price"" so she can make soup for ""half a dozen other old folks."" (As a character, she's also a most interesting mother-in-law.)Rita's husband, Taylor, died ten years ago, in a freak farm-field accident. Or was it maybe not an accident? --- wonders her middle-aged son, Mack, who lives in the original farm house, having sold off most of his land, given up farming, and taken a job at a machinery store in town. Maybe his dad was intentionally careless, thinking his family needed life insurance money more than they needed him. The tragic loss of his father only compounds that of another absent figure. Who knows what demons had driven Mack's only brother Alex to drink and self-destruct?As the story starts, Mack has a lot on his mind. Armed with a parcel of prescription medicines, he's just being released from a psych ward, where he's been treated for suicidal despair. He's coming back home, oblivious to the precarious mental states of other family members. His wife Jodie, stretched to the limit, trying to hold the family together, is increasingly attracted to and aware of the workplace attentions of  ""another man."" His fervently pious and devout 14-year-old daughter Kenzie is spending hours after school praying at the altar rail of First Baptist Church. But where is her spiritual path really leading her? Then there's his 17-year-old son, known as Young Taylor. Troubles here are more obvious; he's taken to wearing all-black clothing and white face makeup. Should Mack be as worried about Young Taylor as Mack's mother is?Some of the interesting family dynamics draw on that very topic of worry and responsibility. Who's worried about whom and why? Who's responsible for what and whom, and to what extent?The lead character in this story is Mack, but Wright thoroughly develops the personalities and inner lives of all the family members, bringing each, separately, to a personal, age-appropriate crisis. Ultimately Wright brings the family from the brink back to a centered hope and a faith, lived maybe not victoriously but with a tempered affirmation of possibilities. Chapters open with epigrams taken from old hymns, and the last chapter significantly starts with a question: ""Is not this the land of Beulah?""DWELLING PLACES is clearly the story of the Barnes family, but the stage-set is larger than a family farm. What happens to community dynamics when the banker and the farmer attend the same church? What healing can a church community effect when members gather to acknowledge the reality of their losses?This novel includes some adult themes and is not for readers who need light, airy plotlines. But if you're looking for complex characterizations, a satisfying read, and possibly needing something to draw out a few tears --- mourning your own collection of personal griefs --- I highly recommend DWELLING PLACES.   --- Reviewed by Evelyn Benc",1
"I am a proponent of organic foods and products -- most of the products (food, cleaners, toiletries, etc) I buy are organic, and I know that contributes to my health. And the medical community is finally realizing that the overwhelming amount of white sugar, white flour and processed foods in the Western diet has led to an epidemic of obesity, heart disease and diabetes in this country. No disagreement there. (Atkins and the South Beach Diet say the same).But be very careful about going overboard in accepting all of what this book says. A friend of our family gave us a copy of this book to read. This friend has become religiously devoted to this book's advice and outlook on health. He has become self-righteous about the health 'knowledge' he has gained from it, to the point of insulting the people around him (co-workers, friends) who have any kind of health issue by telling them that it's because they don't eat right.Well, the proof is in the pudding. I saw this friend recently, and I seriously did not recognize him: he looked sickly, deathly thin, very pale, with sunken cheeks and eyes. Prior to getting into this book, he was very healthy and normal looking.I don't know if this change for the worse is because of the book itself, or because he is going way overboard with its advice. But some of the negative reviews match my impressions I have gotten of the book based on our friend's 'testimony' and attitude, and now, even his sickly appearance. So beware",1
"WOW! At first I thought this would be a run-of-the-mill psych book, but it is actually outstanding! I've read about personality from some other sources, but this is by far the best I've seen. It is a goldmine of useful information. You will find out exactly what kind of person you really are. You will find the answers to the mysteries of your life. You will find out why you behaved the ways you did and why your life has turned out the way it has. You will find out how to get the best out of your particular set of personality traits. You will find out how to best deal with other people of different personalities. I found out why my parents were unnurturing - it's because that's just how the workaholic types are. This book describes 13 different personality styles which everyone has to varying degrees. This book shows you how they affect things like your work and love life. It shows you how to best cope with and minimize your weaknesses. This book enabled me to accept who I am and make the best of it. This book answered so many questions that have been a vexing mystery to me all my life. I think there are a few therapists here poo-pooing this book because it is very helpful and THEY are NOT! They're jealous! Truth is that most therapists and psychiatrists are incompetent and just waste your time. Many people like me know that from bitter experience. This book is VALID because it perfectly nailed down my personality traits and explained them like nothing else ever has and gave me tons of very helpful info and advice that I didn't even dream existed.

"This is a terrible disappointment.  My grandchildren and I also collect words and compile word lists.  This book seemed like a great addition to their library.  The story is weak, the illustrations unattractive...and what is up with the ethnic dialect thing?  I was going to return it but would not have gained much.  Was going to donate it but did not want to be responsible for wider circulation.  Was going to throw it away but could not bring myself to trash a book.  Finally took the weakest way out and shared it with the kids.  There are some fun words... and now their mother will have to dispose of it",1
"I love steamed fish, this steamer is a wide, flat, stable place to put my plate for steaming. I tried to use my vegetable steamer with the post removed but it just wasn't stable enough. This is perfect. We also steamed a few tamales left in the freezer from Christmas, I'm sure you could steam other things like buns or vegetables but I haven't tried those yet. Also, a big plus is that it stores in the wok so it doesn't take up space in the kitchen. Delivery was very fast as well",0
"Describes in detail the world of a life science researcher.  This is a book you'll want to buy in order to read, and re-read again.  Many of the pages are of reference quality such that you'll want to consult again and again.  Especially useful for students with little or no prior experience in a life science research lab",1
"I bought this game and guide over a year ago, but I love the game, and this guide is the perfect compliment to it.  I've yet to find a single mistake in this guide; the maps are flawless, the pictures are exactly what you need to see; every level and subquest is included along with strategies for all. In short, this is probably the most complete and accurate guide I've used so far for any game.  Of course, you can get free tips (and even some crude ASCII maps) on the internet, so I normally wouldn't even recommend buying a retail strategy guide.  But this one is definitely a worthy investment; it's just so much nicer (and prettier) to have everything you need, in lavish detail, right there in one place.  So if you love this game and plan on playing it for 100's of hours like I have, you should probably get this guide.  If you're only a casual fan with a passing interest in the actual game, then yeah, you probably don't need it; but for me this is la creme de la creme of strategy guides.  Nice job",1
This book is such a wonderful way to open up dialogue with yourchildren.  They love to tell you what they would do and you get theopportunity to share your values at the same time.  I really think this is a wonderful way to talk to your kids about peer pressure and right and wrong so they are prepared to make good decisions when the challenges actually arrive. I highly recommend this book to all parents,1
"    WOW !      This can only be described as Dyke-lit.....Deranged Dyke-lit.     WOW !!!     Mary Daly is nothing short of a feminist version of Louis Farrakhan, only that Daly is far more extreme than that.       This is a 417 page raging screed of man hate. It's unreadable drivel. Daly dissects words, and turns them inside out to form linguistic bludgeons. A little of that can be taken as entertaining, and at least somewhat factual, or at least plausibly factual.400+ pages of it....???  It leaves me thinking of the kook in front of my local Post Office who keeps trying to run for President. He rants complete nonsense too, he just hasn't written it down, and had it published.      As a man I find this to be not the least bit threatening. You can't even take this stuff seriously. ""Gynocide"" .... hun???  ""Gynocide"" ????  This chick has such a gyno-centric view of the world she doesn't have the faintest clue as to what makes men tick.   It's a travesty to give this thing even one star.     ",1
"This is the kind of movie no one would have the guts to make today--maybe not even as an indie movie. It's a horror movie that pretends that it's not a horror movie. Just as the girls have to pretend they are not sexual beings but this repression only ignites their sexuality further, Weir pretends this is a straight Victorian drama but that only heightens the mystery and horror further. Modern filmakers seem to have abandoned the ""less is more"" approach to their own detriment. People may find it boring--but it's to serve the theme. Weir tells his story the way Victorians lived their lives--with everything swept under the rug. And there is a point to the second half of the movie. It's a retelling of the first half. Miranda and her girls are done in by the hidden mystery and supernatural cruelty of nature. Sarah is done in by the hidden cruelty of human nature which lies behind that perfect Victorian etiquette. The rock and the headmistress are basically the same character. ",0
"Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash are largely responsible for starting off the country star duet cycle in the late 1960's and they won every duet award to be had but they only record three albums together despite decades of performing together.  This first album is the best, recorded actually before they were married.  These tracks are packed with the sexual sparks these two soul mates displayed on the stage. Cash certainly seems to be enjoying himself more in the duets than in any of his solo work, he's clearly having fun!  And who wouldn't, June gives such a delicious comic sass to their toe-tapping numbers.  Their legendary hit ""Jackson"" is here as well as their sassy smash ""Long Legged Guitar Pickin' Man"".  Just as good is their first duet hit, ""It Ain't Me, Babe"".  The Carter Family adds their unmistakable harmony to ""Shanytown"" - with all these Johnny and June reissues on the market, there is a definate need for some of the 60's/70's Carter Family recordings to come out of the vaults.  Johnny & June weren't as prolific as Porter & Dolly or Conway & Loretta or even George & Tammy but they certainly take a back seat to no one when it comes to producing great music together. Be sure also to get the brand new 16 BIGGEST HITS collection by Johnny and June which has all of their popular duet hits in one package",0
"I remember buying this book. I walked up to the register holding the thin hardcover, a coffee table book, and a CD, all graced with John Lennon's picture. ""Infatuated, much?"" The cashier inquired.And who wouldn't be tickled all shades of pink by this collection of stories and poems? The world knew he had a talent for rhyme, and a wicked sharp sense of humor, but not many singer/songwriters can carry their own outside the studio. (Jewel's poem book...that guy from Smashing Pumpkins. Ringing any bells?) This is one of the few books I've read where the literature defies my expectations and ends up raising the bar despite me. Something about the words stands alone--they perform with or without an audience, and always with the same goal in mind.A beautiful book written by a beautiful man, this is a poignant reminder of what it means to be a wordsmith. Few people have safely utilized Lennon's misuse of words.One can only imagine what a moment in John Lennon's mind would be like, but this is as close to it as we'll ever get, and for that I am eternally grateful",1

"Like any artist, Teena Marie has been effected by changes in modern music production, but who cares?!!  Every track is still classic Teena Marie!  She was the first R&B female to rap on an album in the 80's, and she continues to manipulate the mainstream as she wishes, while staying true to the sound that has kept her on the scene for 3 decades.  The CD is really good music.  Miss T did her thing!",0
"Reasons to own this set:First: Patrick McGoohan. A young Patrick McGoohan. If that isn't reason enough for you to run out and seize this set, you are made of tougher stuff than I. Women want to be with him, men want to be him (wait, that's Austin Powers...still....) Second: the screenplays are absolute marvels. Even though these are half-hour episodes, the writing is tight as can be. These seem like full-length films. You can't take your eyes off for a second as the action is nonstop. Third: these period pieces, filmed at the height of the Cold War are the real spy genre. John Drake (McGoohan's character, later transformed into Secret Agent) is the cool, ""I don't do wet-work"", get the job done action man. It was reported that McGoohan turned down the job of James Bond because the Bond role required jumping in and out of beds and doing a lot of killing; John Drake rescues damsels in distress, not dames in a state of undress. We ration out watching McGoohan trudging around Portmerion-as-Italy or on location in some other places and it never, ever palls. For Prisoner fans, this is a must-have as a precursor to that iconic series. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for all fans of spy drama",0
"I liked this book because it had one or two simple activities that you could do with your children in order to learn something about secular holidays. There was a green eggs recipe in order to celebrate Dr. Seuss' birthday (March 2nd) and then a little lesson about how to respond when you are served foods you don't like. It's nice having a quick index for parents to do fun, simple activities with children. Most didn't involve more than some construction paper, crayons and maybe a 2Liter bottle.",1
"The book I read was My Side of the Mountain. Jean Craighead George is the author. My Side of the Mountain is about a teenager who is sick of living in the city. He lives in an apartment with his family in New York City but is unhappy there, so he runs away to the Catskill Mountains where his grandfather has some property. He tries to survive against the brutal winter and ice covered trees, hunters during the deer season, and tries not to be seen by hikers and campers. The setting in the book is in the 1960's or 70's and takes place in New York. The main character in the story is named Sam Gribley. Sam is adventurous and does not like to be kept inside. He can make tools out of stuff you can find in the woods. He is also very brave and courageous for going and staying in the woods alone. 	This book is realistic fiction. The moral of the story is if you want something, do something about it. I highly recommend this book for others because it is great how the author explains everything. Sam makes different tools out of twigs and grass and the author explains every detail. The book is also very adventurous and exciting. If you want a book where you hate to stop reading, then this is a great book!",1

"I had ignored this movie on the rental shelf many times, thinking that it would be a very boreing bio about a forgotten old actress. Then one day I examined the pictures on the box and notices the star wearing the sexy ""banana suit"". So of-course, I rented it immediately !It turned out to be a beautiful movie about the life of a fallen angel/fallen hero. It shows you how she became one of the richest black women in showbusiness, a member of the resistance in World War 2, and a fighter for civil rights. I noticed a lot of symbolism in this movie. Like during the first 5 minutes of the movie, she does her provacative topless night dance. If you look really deep, you won't just focus on her body....what you will begin to focus on is HER EYES, her wild untameable eyes. During her life she was untameable, always fighting, not willing to giveup.The star Lynn Whitfield is very entoxicating. If you're a guy, she'll make you forget all about Hally Berry",0
"This cookbook is a must for those who want a refreshing, tasty meal but do not have the hours, or the energy, to spend in the kitchen. If you work outside the home or if you live alone and do not want to go to all the effort of preparing a time-consuming meal for one, you will find the recipes here are just what you are looking for. There is plenty of flavour in each of the dishes and the wonderful part is that most recipes can be prepared in approximately thirty minutes. No more frustrated children (or cranky husband) asking, &quot;When will dinner be ready - how much longer?&quot; These recipes are a cinch to prepare and soooo delicious! This book is highly recommended and most deserving of a five-star rating",1

My husband then showed up.(I called him and told him to come). I taught him how to halter and then stepped out of the round pen....the horse Joined up with my husband....I cried again....My husband was literally beaming with pride....He then took the horse for a nice walk around the stables.... I have to again thank you....I can catch the most uncatchable horse at the boarding faciliy thanks to your book.....Much to the amazement of the stable owner,,,,who states she has never been able to catch him.....She said he was a cowboy horse and they had to rope him to catch him.....NOT anymore....Now he is my husbands horse....Thank you.Also I may add that a few days later after working with my husband and teaching him the right body language,  he was able to approach the horse and halter him, in pasture.",1
"This is a gorgeous book;  hardcover with glossy pages of varying sizes and vibrant color.  For every country in the world (yes, EVERY country), the book lists some important information, such as what language the people speak, the currency, the flag, and how to say hello (with pronunciations).  It also shows a map of the country, listing the major cities and natural landmarks.  For the major countries, the book also gives additional information like the foods people like to eat, famous landmarks, natural ""wonders,"" and famous people.  The page on Germany, for instance, gives not only the basic information but also pictures of the Brandenburg Gate, Neu Schwanstein, an Audi, the Black Forest, some sausages and beer.I bought this book because I really admire Priddy books in general, and I wanted to add this one to my son's collection.  My son spends HOURS looking through his other Priddy word books, and I suspect that this one will be no exception.  He's only 20 months old now, however, and so this picture atlas is far too advanced for him, but it will be handy as he starts to ask questions about where he lives in relation to where other people live.  I can tell it will be a useful reference -- it's fun to look at, and is full of great information to get conversations started.As with all other Priddy books, this is highly recommended",1
"12 year old Gerry Garner joins a group of ""heavy"" kids that are sent to their favorite fat camp for the summer, ""Camp Hope"" (a place where they're supposed to lose weight, but instead have a fun time). The kids find out that the camp has been sold to a crazy fitness instructor named Tony Perkins (Ben Stiller), so now, the camp has turned into a living hell for the kids. No more candy, or fun things like Go Karts and ""The Blob"". Tony wants the kids to lose weight, so he'll be able to make a profit from his fitness TV commercials (he has a camera man follow him around the camp). However, the kids rebel against Tony, because they want to have fun, not exercise, therefore, Tony starts to go crazy (in a hilarious way), so he decides to counter their actions, for example: one day, he takes their lunch away, and on another day, takes them on a 20 mile hike, among other things. Gerry and his new friends, along with the original camp staff members Pat, who has visited the camp every summer for the past 18 years, and a goofy counselor named Tim who became fit before the summer, as well as a new nurse named Julie, decide to take the camp back.Ben Stiller is HILARIOUS in this movie. Seeing him as an insane health nut, patting kids down, searching for a pez dispenser or watching his character getting mad at the kids is great. While the film is not a cinema masterpiece, Stiller's performance in this film is great, and he delivers some of the funniest lines I've heard in a movie. His character in this film is like a younger version of White Goodman in ""Dodgeball"". Is this a guilty pleasure? Definitely.As for the DVD, in 2002, Disney established a new policy whereby any movies that they feel have limited adult appeal will be released on DVD in Pan & Scan only. No widescreen DVD. They've reneged a bit since then, but many titles from their live action catalogue have made their DVD debuts exclusively in reformatted fullscreen. This affects every unreleased live action Disney film, particularly those that the studio suspects have limited appeal outside of children. THEREFORE, this film, like many Disney classics, is only available on DVD in fullscreen (pan and scan). BLEH",0
"Two sections are absolutely incredible in this book-- that of &quot;Rational Self-Interest&quot; and &quot;Death Anxiety&quot;.  Dr. Branden uses REASON as his perfect way to convey his ideas.  He is the  first author in this area, that does not look at self-esteem as if it is  something by itself that you &quot;work on&quot;.  Instead, he reveals what  it really is, and how it comes about from REAL choices and actions; thus,  it is based in reality.  Dr. Branden's books are rare to me in that I read  them almost continually; while other books are useful and good, I would put  them on my shelf and re-read them only occassionally.  I am ALWAYS reading  at least one of Branden's books at any time, continually",1
"There is a reason this recording is the best selling jazz album of all time. The music is magical - I loved it when I was a teenager in the early 70's (despite being a ""rock"" fan), and it's still special 35 years later. I highly recommend getting the pure CD format. This disc is not a pure CD - it is a special new format called DualDisc, with ""CD Audio""* on one side, and DVD video content and 5.1 audio on the other side. Seems like a great idea, a great way to get people to buy CD's instead of downloading them. NOT! Notice that asterisk next to ""CD Audio""? There is a warning on the outside of the disk that it does not comply with the strict CD-Audio format, and it may not play on some CD or DVD players. If that was the only problem with this disc I say fine - the risk is worth the possible reward.  But no. Despite the added content of the DualDisc format with various extras, the DualDisc format is treacherous, very treacherous. If you want to play this ""CD"" (DualDisc - CD side) on a computer, on a Windows machine it installs a small hidden piece of software on your machine altering the driver for your CD or DVD drive reducing the CD/DVD's functionality. I have not yet been able to reverse the damage this disc has done to my machine's software despite reading many posts about methods to do this. I never agreed to any software installation (I never would have), and yet my CD/DVD drives have lost the ability to do DMA. And to add insult to injury, the DualDisc - CD side will not play on my computer - I cannot even listen to it where I spend many hours a day. Outrageous.  I've wasted so much time on this DualDisc that I haven't had the time to watch the DVD side content. Unbelievable that I paid for this abuse - this is the way the publisher Sony/BMG - Columbia treats a legitimate customer? I don't have enough words to describe my loathing for the purveyors of this current DualDisc product.  This DualDisc seems to violate the first rule of customer relations - ""treat your customers with respect.",0
"I love Christmas Movies and I also love to read romance books and this movie is based on a Christmas themed romance book called A Christmas Love by Kathleen Creighton though the title of the movie was changed to A Holiday to Remember. I have the book this movie was based on but haven't read it yet but I did peek at a couple of pages in the book and it looks like Carolyn and Clay didn't know each other in the book until they were adults but they changed it in this movie that they had known each other in their past and were getting married after they had finished high school but she jilted him and left him standing at the alter. Though I didn't read the book except to peek at a couple of pages and I can't really compare them I can say that the movie was good and the acting was very good especially from Connie Sellecca, Randy Travis and Rue McClannahan. The movie is about a recently divorced woman named Carolyn played by Connie Sellecca who takes her teenage daughter and moves from California back to the small Southern town she grew up in, the town she hasn't been back to since she jilted her fiance Clay at the alter and when she gets there she runs into Clay played by Randy Travis and his aunt Leona played by Rue McClannahan, a character unlike the character Blanche she played on The Golden Girls but more like a combination of Rose, Sophia and Dorothy, a down homey type like Rose but feisty like Sophia and wise like Dorothy but the only resemblance between Leona and Blanche is the southern accents. This is good movie!",0

Frankl, 'Souls on Fire' by Elie Wiesel is among the two books that have changed my life.In these powerful and beautiful stories of Jewish Hasidic masters Elie Wiesel teaches us to fight depression by deliberately cultivating joy,that we must enjoy life in spite of life,that death is never the answer,and that that life is sacred,so much so that in spite of anything we have suffered we must say yes to this life.In sum this book (and Frankl's) should be read by all who struggle with sadness.It is a very poetic and life-affirming book by a survivor who has seen ultimate evil in man and yet still affirms the holiness of our lives",1

"Tony Williams Lifetime in this collection is composed of Allan Holdsworth on guitar, Alan Pasqua on keyboards, Tony Newton on bass and some vocals, and Tony Williams on the drums. Tony Williams got his start early on the drums by being a drummer for trumpeter Miles Davis when he was only 17 years old and left at the age of 23. Miles Davis was extremely impressed with the skill that Williams possessed. Miles commented, ""Tony played on top of the beat, just a fraction above, and it gave everything a little edge because it had a little edge. Tony played polyrhythms all the time. He was a cross between Art Blakey and Philly Joe Jones, Roy Haynes and Max Roach.""The Lifetime rhythm section grooves and grooves hard in this album. The mixture of jazz and funk creates the perfect environment for a rhythm section, sometimes forgotten in jazz in favor of wind instruments, to shine. Each player gets his time to shine in this album. The rhythms that Tony Williams provides creates a central groove that can be heard at all times during the album. It is amazing to hear Williams not only lay down the beat, but also solo and fill like it is a beat. Holdsworth and Pasqua create their awesome and funky melodies on top of the hard grooving that Newton and Williams provide.Vocals by Tony Newton are contained on ""You Did It To Me Baby"" and ""Joy Filled Summer"". String and horn accompaniment is featured on ""You Did It To Me Baby"".   It was great to listen to a great grooving album with electric instruments and the excellent drumming by Tony Williams. A must have for all funk drummers and a great CD for those of us that want to sit back and enjoy the groove.Total Playing Time: 77:10Total Tracks: 13Originally Recorded in 1975-1976 as Believe It! and Million Dollar Legs by Columbia Jazz.

"Reading Gene Kranz's experience as mission controller at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration brought back childhood dreams of being a ""space man"". Gene Kranz lead an exciting life, and he relates his story through exciting tales from is tenure at NASA.Many times during his recollection of events at NASA I felt the the exhilaration of a mission accomplished, and the defeat and sadness during NASA's failures. I felt the adrenaline coursing through my veins during the reentry into the atmosphere of Apollo 13, and felt saddened when reading the account of the electrical fire that took the lives of three brave astronauts.Much can be learned from Kranz's life experiences in both making career decisions and in facing conflict head on without surrendering or admitting defeat. Often Gene Kranz's bravery and persistence during a seemingly impossible situation, has inspired me during challenges in life.I would recommend keeping this book in your library for reference in dealing with your own seemingly impossible tasks. This book will help you in making decisions concerning your career and your life. It must have been difficult for Gene to give up his flying job for a desk job, but the world and our country are the better from his selfless decision.Gene's dedication to his family, the space program, and the the United States of America is evident in his memoirs.

"From the tone of Dr. Seger's book on web-thinking, one comes away with the humorous impression that she believes she personally invented the entire concept of networking.  What could have been a helpful text is written instead as a look-at-everything-I've-done account that falls short of enlightening or inspiring women professionals who are serious about making the right connections in the film industry or anywhere else. Much of this, unfortunately, is due to a voice that borders on condescension and implies her readers wouldn't recognize common sense if it jumped up and bit them.  This was a disappointment in light of her prior releases regarding women in the movie biz.  By comparison, there are just better business-oriented resources available out there if networking is something that readers want to hone in order to advance in their professions.  It is also essentially a rehash of some of her earlier books which were more persuasive and practical in their focus.  I came away from this one wondering what the point of all of it was",1

"It seems that ""Napoleon Dynamite"" has a very pronounced polarizing effect on viewers--you either love it or hate it. In my opinion, a film that can elicit such strong responses in an audience (for better or for worse) is worth its salt. Any movie can lull an audience into feeling a predetermined emotion, be it patriotic fervor, paranoia, lust, or nostalgia, and sometimes these movies can be very well done (but often they're two-dimensional cookie-cutter affairs). However, Napoleon Dynamite is one of a tiny group of films that remain emotionally open-ended. Reviewers condemn its ""lack of plot"" and bland texture, but it is only plotless and bland in the sense that you have to do a little thinking and connecting with your own life and experience to appreciate it. And maybe you won't. Maybe it hits a little too close to home, and you'd rather reject it. Maybe Ebert was right (in a sense), and you'll either pity Napoleon or, as several reviewers have proclaimed, want to beat the stuffing out of him (these people are called bullies, and one of them features prominently in the film).Suffice it to say, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is nuanced. It requires patience and understanding and empathy--there are no explosions or conspiracy theories or crude jokes. It reminded me of Wes Anderson's movies (""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" ""Rushmore,"" ""The Life Aquatic""), especially the polarized audience effect. Watch it for the subtle details, the facial expressions, the pauses for effect. Napoleon, Pedro, Deb, and Kip are average Americans--they are like you and me--we all have quirks, shortcomings, a certain level of geekiness (try as we might to cover it up or pretend otherwise; let's admit it, we're on here reviewing movies). So if you can see the humor in everyday life and laugh at yourself, you'll enjoy ""Napoleon Dynamite.",0

I have gotten papers from school, that my son did poorly on and then found the answers of how to modify the papers to make them do-able for my son (same work just presented in a way he can understand). Then I would show the teacher the idea(s). I have been doing this all year and have learned the majority of the accomodations and modifications I show the teacher are from this book.  The teacher now incorporates these into all of my sons school work.  This has decreased his frustration and improved his quality of scool work and learning.

"Hey, you might say, what's this? This guy's reviewing a fantasy novel and yet gives his review a title that suits Orwell's ""1984"". Well, the short version of the story is, I come from a post-communist country. The spirits of communism still haunt today's society and many people, especially from my generation, but mostly ones from Western Europe and USA, simply don't envision what communism, the real one, not the utopian one, was about.The long version: in this book, Goodkind draws probably the most detailed analysis of communism I've ever seen. This is not taken from a utopian point of view, Goodkind doesn't draw pictures of a prison-state like Orwell's ""1984"", nor does he follow the lead of Kafka's ""Trial"". Instead, his picture of communism is one of the real people and real motivations - the flesh and blood of the system.What I've seen lacking from most historical descriptions of communist systems, as well as the press articles describing the situation in communist countries, is a detailed analysis. Why does the system work? How does the system work? You have all of this and more in this novel. Goodkind shows this from both a psychological and a philosophical point of view - he shows the reader why people follow communists, why idealists fall for the communist dream, where's the ruse here and why the system is inherently evil. This is a story of how communism destroys people , not in the dramatic sense of political prisoners and death sentences to political opponents, but the slow work of the demoralizing system causing people to become ""living zombies"", who have no will to oppose and no motivation for self-cultivation.What the book lacks is spell-throwing battles, swordslashing, epic battles of Good versus Evil - of all the novels from Goodkind's Sword of Truth, this one is by far the least 'fantasy' novel. I will be honest with you - if you desire a pure heroic fantasy novel the likes of Wizard's First Rule and are bored by 50 pages of psychological games between characters, you will be pretty much disappointed by this book. I, on the other hand, found it a pleasant surprise - a book that gives a lot to think about and a lot of very real-life insight into one of the 20th century horrors instead of a fun and enjoyable, but intelectually nondemanding 'easy read'. The choice is yours",1

"This movie is a great one, and you will like it even more if you are interested in the historic time period in which it takes place.Mel Gibson plays a pacifist who, after doing his best to avoid violence, has it thrust upon him by a heartless officer.  After one of his boys gets murdered right in front of his eyes, IT'S ON!!!  While I am not big on revenge, this movie urges that justice be done.  You find yourself rooting for Mel Gibson every step of the way after that.  This is easily one of the best period pieces ever made",0
"I am the mother of an adult bipolar daughter and have read this book to my grandson who is seven years old. It's right on the money. Mental illness is difficult for most adults to truly understnd let alone a child.

"I have been amazed at the response we have received since the first screening...universally audiences are touched by so many of the stories on the screen but beyond that everyone I have talked to has their own story to tell.

"This is a review of many different types of fraud. It is perhaps most applicable for a course in school. To make it more interesting in the next edition, I recommend that the author tie the fraud to the penalties and the likely liability of perpetrators, chances of getting caught, and more anecdotes about criminal cases brought to conclusion, and details about how the prosecutors operate. The (surprising) general idea I get from the book is that fraud is rampant and seldom discovered. The collection of estimates about the society-wide costs of fraud at the end of the book is fascinating, as is the history of fraud at the beginning.",1

"Can the computer be used to prove God's existence? Dale Kohler, a computer scientist, attempts to find out. He goes to Roger Lambert, a professor of theology, to seek out funding for his project, and much of the novel consists of ""debates"" between the two men, Lambert siding with faith as the only way to know God. (There's irony here, too, and not a little bit of self-interest on Lambert's part, because he fears if Kohler succeeds he [Lambert] will be out of a job.)All does not occur in the stratosphere of philosophical debate, however, as some very down-to-earth happenings are dealt with. It's possible that Kohler has had an affair with Roger's wife Esther, though there's no way Roger (or the reader) finds out for sure. Even when she becomes pregnant there's no way of knowing whether it's by Lambert of Kohler. Ironically, this is Roger's ""by faith alone"" argument coming back to haunt him. Lambert has a brief affair of his own with the somewhat seedy Verna, who also seems to know a lot about computers (she's a friend of Kohler's). Kohler's experiment eventually fails, or at least it can't be repeated after some kind of ""image"" appears on his computer screen. Many people might be turned off by the depth of the argument between Lambert and Kohler as Updike makes references to the Patristic Fathers and rather technical scientific and theological points of view. But I thought that was one of the most interesting things about the book. There are also many similarities between this work and Hawthorne's THE SCARLET LETTER. In general I thought the book not as good as the Rabbit books, but among the top tier of Updike's novels",1

"I have to say that I am in constant worry of the state our Country & World are in. Friends of mine, that have been healthy their whole lives (have hardly drank or ever smoked and eat healthy)and are in their 20's and 30's, are coming down with breast cancer, kidney cancer, liver cancers... all having no family history of this stuff. HOW ARE THEY GETTING IT???? Why are our beloved pets being killed now with this pet food that has been recalled? How did all that rat poison get into the foods???? I just lost my cat this past December and am highly supspect that was the problem though I cannot prove it. I had two cats, unrelated, for 8 years that developed diabetes. My husband has Type II diabetes now; he is 38 yrs old. He was on Nexium for years (stomach acid problems) and is taking a ton of glucophage every day for the diabetes. Again, only treating the symptom but not getting to a cure for him. I recently made him go to a Naturopath and he was off the Nexium within 3 months. We both got a full panel of blood work done and are on the recommended supplements to get back to health. We both feel much better and are now working on his diabetes. I know the supplements are expensive but isn't your health/life worth it? Kevin also commented that it is impossible to do all the stuff he recommends in the book overnight or ever for that matter. Making gradual changes the best you can do or afford is the way to go. It is not expensive to grow your own vegetables or make your own bread; we do. Buy a Brita water filter and use that if you can't afford to put a system in your house. There are ways to get healthier without spending a fortune.  We are slowing killing ourselves gobbling down all these pills that treat only the symptoms of all these illnesses but then cause another. That's what is ridiculous to me; not Kevin Trudeau. The FDA and the Pharma companies are getting rich off of us while we live with unexplained illnesses and eventually get very sick and/or die! Just think, if we had cures for all of the epidemics out there, (breast cancer & all cancers for that matter, HPV, AIDS- which I highly believe some could have been manmade and released for experimentation & do have cures but are hidden) then why would we need drugs or doctors for that matter. They would be out of business! They want to keep us sick! Please consider what I am saying and do not be brainwashed any longer! Check out these two links; it will make your head spin!

"Yet another brilliant collection from Datlow and Windling. ""The Green Man"" takes you furthur into the otherworldly forest realm with each new story. I could not stop reading, knowing that with each new author came another tale I knew I wanted to get lost in. The beautiful chapter illustrations by Charles Vess serve as more than decoration, but set the stage for the next story to be ensared by. His ability to capture the spirit of a story in only a few inches of ink is reason enough to buy this book for me. The enchanting stories by such greats as Charles De Lint, Neil Gaiman and Gregory MacGuire are a pretty good reason too",1
"Anatomy and Asana is quite an accomplishment.  I took a university course on yoga, and recommended that this text be added to the required reading.  Any serious student of yoga, and all instructors, should have this book as a resource.  The information is clearly and concisely presented, with illustrations and brief meditative quotes throughout.  I agree with the reader below that it complements Coulter's much larger book ""The Anatomy of Hatha Yoga"" well, and would add, that if you found his text daunting, start here.  What makes ""Anatomy and Asana"" more accessible is that it was created to accompany a live workshop, and has more of a ""workbook/presentation"" feel.  That said, it's amazing how much information is on these pages.  You will refer to this yoga resource for years to come",1

Its combination of literary, political and pop culture essays was replete with fresh information and insights, and I was pleased with its lack of political correctness.

" Supreme Bar Rvw's MPRE course is amazing. I took one of my school's ethics classes to fulfill the professional responsibility requirement & prepare for the MPRE. Unfortunately, I didn't learn much, so I was vary wary about taking the MPRE. Fortunately, Supreme's course taught me everything I needed to know & then some - I scored 30 pts above the minimum pass score for my jurisdiction. Professor Lazarus does a great job of explaining the course's rather thorough outline, & does an even better job of showing how to deal with the exam's tougher questions. He is serious, but has a wry sense of humor, & a presence that is both authoritative & comforting.  The course also comes with many practice questions & well written answers for each. One of the best things about the course is that unlike in a crowded lecture, you can stop it when you come to a difficult pt, rewind it, & watch it as many times as you want! I highly recommend this course! - I would take this over Barbi anyday!(its alot less expensive than a Barbri course too!",1
"This is a terrifc book by a unique writer.That's no surprise, because Karen Blixen (Isak Dinesen) wrote a number of fine books. Her ledger contains a couple of volumes of reminiscence about her life in Africa, a pseudonymous novel of adventure (_The Angelic Avengers_), and posthumously published books of stories (_Carnival_) and essays (_Daguerrotypes_). Despite the interest and occasional excellence of these books -- especially in the case of _Out of Africa_ -- it's as a writer of long stories that she exhibited her greatest artistry and achievement.She published 4 collections of short stories in her lifetime: _Seven Gothic Tales_, _Winter's Tales_, _Anecdotes of Destiny_, and _Last Tales_. She also published a slim novel (really a novella), _Ehrengard_. As a devoted reader, I've enjoyed every one of these books.  Still, it does her no disservice to point out that some are better than others.Her first book, _Seven Gothic Tales_ is usually the book of stories that people remember first -- deservedly, because any book that contains ""The Deluge at Norderney,"" ""The Monkey,"" and ""The Poet"" gets high marks.  The other stories in the book aren't exactly chopped liver, either.However, I will submit that _Winter's Tales_ deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the earlier book. I approached _Winter's Tales_ the first time expecting to be disappointed after the bravura performance of _Seven Gothic Tales_. I was surprised in the most pleasant manner imaginable. Indeed, in some ways, _Winter's Tales_ surpasses the earlier book as a work of art. The level of writing is uniformly high; the style is still ornate and surprising, but better controlled. And there are still the touches of melodrama and the gothic that give much of her work a strange feeling of having emerged from the 19th Century, while at the same time being very modern.Although I found the whole of _Winter's Tales_ to my taste, some of the stories stand out. Two stories that I particularly liked were ""Alkmene"" and ""The Fish""; but what puts this book over the top is that it contains ""Sorrow Acre,"" arguably the best example of Blixen's fiction.  In fact, one could argue that ""Sorrow Acre"" is one of the finest stories written in the 20th century by *anyone*. An historical and philosophical novella that reconstructs a day in 19th century Denmark, it plays out personal tragedy and comedy on an aristocratic estate with a subtle irony worthy of Theodor Storm or (dare I say) Thomas Mann. By itself, it was worth the price of admission. I've read it many times since. The thematic connections between this story and the earlier ""The Deluge at Norderney"" are patent.Her two later collections, _Anecdotes of Destiny_ and _Last Tales_ have their moments. In particular, several stories from _Anecdotes..._ have grown on me over the years, such as ""Babette's Feast"" and ""Tempests."" Still, to my mind, she hit her high water mark in _Seven Gothic Tales_ and _Winter's Tales_",1

"Nicholas Monsarrat's superbly written ""The Cruel Sea"" captures in fiction the essence of the Battle of the North Atlantic in a way that a history could not.  It describes, at a very human level, the desperate struggle to safely escort convoys across the North Atlantic in the face in incessant Nazi submarine and aircraft attacks.  On the success of the these convoys hung the outcome of war; without them, the Allied war effort would have ground to a halt and Britain would have starved.The narrative of ""The Cruel Sea"" centers on two men and two ships.  George Ericson, a middle-aged commercial sea captain and Royal Navy Reserve officer, is recalled to the fleet in 1939 to lead the newly commissioned corvette HMS Compass Rose.  Also central to the narrative is young Lockhart, a very green and newly commissioned Sub-Lieutenant who will grow into a fine naval officer and Ericson's ""Number One"" on both the Compass Rose and a follow-on command, the frigate HMS Saltash.  ""The Cruel Sea"" is populated by an astonishingly rich cast of supporting characters, including ship's company at sea and wives and girlfriends ashore.The story itself, richly informed by the author's own experiences at sea in the Second World War, is that of the convoys.  The Compass Rose and the Saltash will spend weeks at sea, sheparding merchant vessels under wartime conditions, enduring the harsh weather of the North Atlantic, and fighting the Nazi onslaught.  It is a fight that calls for patience, endurance, skill, and cunning, much of it learned the hard way, on the job.  The fight will demand the utmost from the men of the Compass Rose and the Saltash, making heroes of some and breaking others.  Monsarrat captures it all in superbly readable, often lyrical prose: the mundane routine, the terror of combat, and the heartbreak of loss.""The Cruel Sea"" does not attempt to glorify war.  Monsarrat faithfully describes the huge human cost of war, in the strains on tired and frightened men, the struggle to acquire and keep the hard edge necessary to kill in combat, and in the sometimes unsuccessful effort to have a normal life ashore. This book is very highly recommended to the reader interested in the Battle of the North Atlantic and to the reader looking for a superb novel of the sea",0

"This is one of the most important nutrition books of our time and has spawned thousands of other nutrition books. Over 3,000 other books have been written about this topic. Eating foods with a low glycemic impact has been a cornerstone of my own eating style. Glycemic impact incorporates the twin principles of the glycemic index and glycemic load. The glycemic index measures the percentage rise of blood glucose caused by various carbohydrate foods in comparison to pure glucose. The glycemic load applies the glycemic index to serving sizes. This enables us to healthily eat foods with a higher glycemic index and still control their overall glycemic impact. For example a half cup of peaches has a carbohydrate count of 10 grams. With a glycemic index of 42, it has a glycemic load of only 4 (10 X .42 = 4). Cantaloupe has a much higher glycemic index of 65, but because a half cup only contains 6 grams of carbohydrates, it also has a glycemic load of 4 (6 X .65 = 4). This is important to know because cantaloupe has more vitamins than any other fruit. We can safely eat a measured amount of cantaloupe without it having a high impact on our blood sugar.Other surprises are forthcoming. Table sugar has a glycemic index of 61 which is considered moderate. Baked potatoes, which are composed of complex carbohydrates, have a glycemic index of 85 which is quite high. This is because table sugar is 50% fructose which has a glycemic index of only 19. Fructose must be converted by the liver into glucose, but it only does so as the body requires. Potatoes, on the other hand, consist of molecules of pure glucose which are rapidly broken down into glucose during the digestive process. Potatoes because of their high nutrient content are not to be forbidden, but their serving sizes do need to be carefully monitored. Learning about these kinds of details can only be done by carefully studying the principles outlined in this book. They are critical to anyone who is serious about managing their weight and blood sugar. I highly recommend this book",1

"In the book titled Critical Pedagogy: Notes from the Read World, Dr. Joan Wink creatively and successfully weaves her personal experiences with useful information on the interaction between teaching and learning. She also discusses the three models of learning. The first being the ""transmission model"" which is when the students engage in passive learning and the teacher passes down information to the students. The second is the ""generative model"" which is when the students actively participate in the classroom. The most important model is the ""transformative model"" because this is when the students use knowledge gained in the classroom to improve their lives outside of school. Her stories and examples are what make the concepts presented in this book all the more real and tangible. Many of us can relate to her stories because we have either experienced something similar to them or know someone else who has. One of the most important concepts of this book is the significance of a teacher being open to various teaching methods in order to adapt to the changing situations in the classroom. I would absolutely recommend this book to others who are interested in becoming teachers because it will help guide them in their journey toward becoming a teacher that every student deserves",1

"Brigham & Young's book is prescribed for the CFA curriculum.  I find Fundamentals of Financial Management to be excellent in all respects.  Twenty years ago, I studied earlier editions of Fundamentals and Intermediate Financial Management while earning my MBA.  I was impressed then and I am even more impressed with the authors efforts now.The table of contents organizes topical material in a progressive and logical manner.  Chapters exploring financial management and markets, cost of capital, capital budgeting, cash flow estimation and risk analysis, capital structure and leverage, and divident policy provide readers with a solid foundation of these concepts.I am very impressed with the authors continued commitment to accuracy.  (The authors offer a $10 reward to the first person who discovers material errors.)  What a pleasure it is to read chapters and illustrative examples knowing that there aren't many miscalculations or sloppy mistakes.Colorful graphic presentations and chapter-end review questions make this book wonderful to read.  The CD-ROM has thus far provided me helpful chapter review quizzes which are ""graded"" on the spot, and the book provides a myriad of website references for further study and inquiry.Truly a 5 star book!  I highly recommend this to any investment professional or serious student of finance",1

"With Spielberg's new film adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS in theatres, more attention is being paid to both the original Wells novel, and the infamous 1938 Welles radio broadcast.  If you're interested in both, why not treat yourself to the best presentation of either version available today?  THE COMPLETE WAR OF THE WORLDS is an excellent book.  It reprint the complete, unedited novel; prints the entire script to the radio play; and comes with a CD containing the entire radio play broadcast, plus archival materials such as the only interview Wells and Welles did together on the topic.  [The recording sound quality is the best I've ever discovered for this play, BTW.]  In addition, the book has lots of great historical and biographical material, including articles looking at the lives of both Wells and Welles; the story of the radio broadcast and the panic it caused; and a survey of the many incarnations of WotW in literature, film, and television.   If you have any curiosity about the book or the radio play, do yourself a favor and buy this book.  It's worth it",1

"I have never read a more cynical writer than Campbell. He shows no restraint in his description of Kosovo,in his opinion,nothing more than ugly brown hills with &quot;ragged&quot; natives. He spends much of his  time ridiculing albanians and where they live.I used to live in Kosovo,and  i can assure you it wasn't that bad. As for the serbs,they get treated a  bit differently. Apparently,the serbs aren't really bad people,just led by  manipulative leaders. Utter nonsense. Serbs might not agree with Milosevic  on most things,but they agreed with him on Kosovo. Blaming evil leaders is  far too convenient",1

"I borrowed this book from my local library, to test a few of the recipes.  I am very impressed!  Every recipe that I've tried has turned out absolutely delicious!  The book begins with an informative section about the meanings behind the buzz word ""organic,"" and the recipes are neatly organized according to age (in case one needs a guideline).  The author has even included little labels that point out which recipes are vegan, vegetarian, and allergy friendly.  As a very picky mom with little patience for recipes that take too long/don't turn out, I highly recommend this book and have purchased my own copy.  The recipes are not only delicious, they are easy and pretty foolproof!  And nothing can top the feeling I get when watching my little boy hungrily gulp down a meal I prepared just for him....eager for each spoonfull.  The recipes aren't just yummy for babies either......I made some of the recipes for my teenage sisters, and they ate every last bite!  If you purchase this book, you won't be disappointed!  ",1
I found this product after searching for ways to make traveling with my two-year old easier.  She loved riding in her carseat through the airport and 6 people stopped me to ask how it worked.

Serger Secrets has been one of the best books on this issue that I have ever read. I loved the full color illistrations  on the different stitches the serger can do.

"I've just listened to the superb audio version of this wonderful book, and recommend it highly. It was a selection for my bookclub, and I had to really search the local libraries to get hold of an unabridged copy-- absolutely worth evey moment of the 12 (or was it 14?) CDs. The narrator, Nigel Anthony, is the ideal actor for this sort of assignment-- lots of characters, both genders, and various class and regional dialects. I was intrigued at our discussion to realize that some readers had been a bit confused about certain things which I feel were completely clear-- and I believe Nigel Anthony's performance is responsible for a lot of that. The mood he created through the voices for the title characters in particular added so much atmosphere and shape to the story that I rather doubt I would have enjoyed it nearly as much if I'd used my own eyeballs, rather than my ears. I may read further Julian Barnes, but I will definitely look for more audio performances by Nigel Anthony",1
I bought this bed for my 2 year old daughter.  It is a very pretty pink bed.  It is perfect for a little girl.  My daughter loves Strawberry Shortcake.  The first night she slept in it she layed down and didn't get up. She slept through the night. She was proud of her new bed.  The bed is tough to put together.  It does need two people to put it together,0
"I remember when I bought this album back in'88. I had heard reign in blood and thought I'd give this a try, well to tell the truth I really didn't know what to think. It didn't really sound like the other albums. At first I was kind of dissappointed! I was wanting to hear speed and angry, fast as hell riffs, but here was this sort of droning singing and chugging guitar. So I put it away for a week and wouldn't you know it I was constantly singing this album. It was stuck in my head like a cancer imbedded deep in your brain. I couldn't get it out of my head, I needed a fix. After that the mighty SLAYER!!!! has been my all time favorite. What makes this album so damn good is the lyrics, the riffs, the drumming, hell everything! It may not be the heaviest out there but if you're a true fan this album will not disappoint, and if it does its your fault for listening to an old coot like me. long live SLAYER!!!!!!!!!!",0

"BB offers no meaningful insights into the securities industry. Like all businesses, there are various types, but he never once calls into question the very nature of the activity. As he is still in business, he does not want to offend the pantheon of interests that control OPM (Other People's Money). Among his comments:1. Long only managers add value - some may. His friends? Who knows. But the vast majority are closet indexers.2. Hedge Funds add value - this is dubious.3. Funds of Funds add value - I TRIED to believe this one. But I can't. Not after BB describes his own diversification strategy. Its just another layer of diversification - and hence fees.He does say that large asset management firms are run along business rather than investment principles. He worked at MSAM for 30 years. THEN he found religion? This is a convenient jailhouse conversion, now that he has a hedge fund.There are several veiled comments that one is only TRULY successful unless one is worth $500.

"As an engineer for several years, but new to telecom, this book has been a wonderful reference.  For one reason, acronyms, for another, descriptions.  People around me and the technical literature constantly express acronyms.  I reach for the book and not only do I find the acronym's definition, but also a paragraph or more to describe it.  If you want in depth descriptions, you must go elsewhere.  I refer to this book at least once daily",1
"I read this book during my second pregnancy.  Now pregnant again, I knew I needed a refresher.   I realize that many books and magazines provide pregnancy and postpartum information, but author (and mother) Theresa Francis-Cheung includes quotes from interviews with moms that really tell it like it is - from their worries about weight gain to battling postbaby blues.  The most helpful tip for me is a list of ""Nutrient-Rich Foods"" (Chap 22) designed to help you lose weight postpartum.  I made a copy of it and posted it on my fridge.  I recommend it to all moms, whether this is your first child or not",1

"Susan Smith Jones is well thought of as a health and fitness expert, and this tape certainly presents her at her inspirational best.  The purpose of the program on this tape is to help you reflect and renew, spend quality time in solitude and silence, simplify and rediscover your relationship with God, and ultimately make peace your constant compantion.  These three cassettes contain 40 messages and affirmations.  Some benefit most by listening to them all at once and others will find playing one message each day of most benefit.  You may find suggestions that don't seem appropriate for your situation.  For instance, a vegetarian diet might not be right for you.  This shouldn't spoil the value of the total program though.  This program is so good for your mind, your body, your soul",1
"Released in 1971 this album shows Gong adopting the heavy space rock sound that would carry them through their most distinctive and classic works: Flying Teapot (1973); Angel's Egg (1973); and You (1974) (aka The Radio Gnome Trilogy).  Unfortunately, after the excellent You album Daevid Allen left the band and Gong moved in a jazz rock direction.  Although I like the jazz rock phase of Gong, it does not quite compare with the magic of their 1971-1974 output, and especially the excellent Camembert Electrique.The core lineup on this album contains French and English musicians of considerable skill: the first-rate Pip Pyle (drums); Christian Tritsch (bass guitar); Didier Malherbe (saxophones, flute); Gilli Smyth (vocals, ""space whisper""); and bandleader Daevid Allen (vocals, electric guitars, and bass).  Also present are two brief appearances by keyboardists Eddy Louiss (Hammond organ and piano); and Constantin Simonovitch (phased piano).  I think it goes without saying that all of the musicians in Gong are excellent.  In fact, Gong has had some of prog's best drummers including Pip and the late Pierre Moerlen.  When the band really gets going, the ensemble work can get very complex.  The bass playing is extremely aggressive and Christian favors a slightly distorted tone on his Fender.  In fact, this tone was used by bassist Mike Howlett during the subsequent albums during the 73-75 period.  Coupled with some wild playing on an equally distorted electric guitar, the interplay between the bassist and guitarist is hair raising.  Pip of course really drives everything along with his incredible technique.  Although I really enjoy Daevid's vocal style and altered spoke word passages, his approach may not appeal to everybody.The 11 tracks on this album all (more or less) blend into one another and include very spacey instrumental interludes that feature Gilli Smyth's sultry space whisper, short experimental passages that fature tape loops and other electronic experimentation, and thunderous prog rock workouts.  Of all the tracks on the album it is only Tried so Hard that comes even somewhat close to being a ""song"" with melodies - it actually brings a bit of a reprieve, especially after the cacophonous closing jam on Fohat Digs Holes in Space, although it too is pretty crazy in its own way.  I guess it is worth mentioning that Fohat... comes close to the sound that Gong would get on albums like Angel's Egg although I think that, in general, the blueprint was pretty much established with this album.  This reissue by Charly is, like all of the other Gong releases by Charly, pretty lousy.  The liner notes are however, informative although the sound quality is only just OK.All in all this is an incredible album of very heavy progressive space rock.  The musicianship is positively top shelf and the music gets pretty cosmic at times.  This is fantastic stuff all around that is highly recommended along with Continental Circus (1972); Flying Teapot; Angel's Egg, and You",0
"This book was boring to me.  The author went on and on with detailed descriptions of the principles of diving, repeating himself many times.  It was very hard to read the story through all this extra detail.  It seemed as if the author needed to add the detail to make the story longer but it actually greatly took away from the story.  I do not recommend",1
"This book is very revealing to the reader of the special aspect of being a Christian, which is being a dispenser as well as a receiver of grace.  So much of the Christianity portrayed today is the exact opposite.  We see more often the Christian faith portrayed as a religious form, political arm, and unloving attitude.  This book is a real insight into the Christian faith  of how to be a true follower of Christ who cared so much about individuals, especially those who were not self righteous, but fallen and in need of grace to restore their lives.

"One of the greatest R&amp;B bands ever, The Ohio Players reached superstardom with this album and their greatest hit ever, &quot;Skin Tight&quot;. From top to bottom, this is one of the most tightest band to ever play. Each musician was accomplished at his instrument. Elements of rock, jazz, pop, and blues were always present in most of their compositions. And while they can funk with the best of them, they can get Isley Brothers-smooth, as evident with &quot;Heaven Must Be Like This&quot;. Many babies were made with this song in the background and if you couldn't get romantic when this song played, there's something wrong with you. With musicianship in R&amp;B/Soul less evident in today's songs, this is a reminder that at one time quality music was created by several humans with technical accuity, not just with one sitting behind a computer",0

"The new Canon EF-S 60mm f2.8 Macro USM Digital SLR lens is designed to cover the entire field of the digital imaging sensors in Canon's digital SLR line, most notably the Canon EOS 20D. This corresponds in film to a normal lens perspective of approximately a 50mm lens. Furthermore it benefits from having Canon's USM autofocusing technology, allowing the photograher to have rapid, almost silent, autofocus, which is important when working in the field (You don't want to distract the animal you are photographing with the sound of the lens being focused.). Although this lens is not a L Series lens, the quality of its construction comes close to Canon's premium L Series professional line of lenses. Indeed, I have read elsewhere an excellent test report (I believe at Erwin Puts's website) on this lens praising its optical performance. Any Canon user of digital SLRs such as the EOS 20D who is interested in macro photography will regard this lens as absolutely essential for making great macro images",0
"I am a recent college graduate with a BS in Math.  I went through college simply as I could.  I chose math because it was typically easy to me, but I never really tried to get any true grasp on it.  I only began to understand the most basic concepts in math when I taught Algebra I for a semester to high school freshmen.  That experience motivated me to develop a better understanding of the most basic concepts in math.  Jump forward a year, and I am now about to enter grad school for applied math.  After reading this book and soaking it in, I feel like I have the tools to be very successful now.  I will take classes with a very different mind set.  I am very excited to get started next week.  I tell you that I am motivated so much that I am going to retake a few undergraduate math courses for my own sanity.  Maybe I'm crazy.  I have never been so excited about math or viewed it as a beautiful art.  It is pure.  Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean Theorem truly humbled me.  I had viewed it before, but had never been motivated to try to understand it.  That is where Dunham steps in.  He creates such an excitement about it that it forces the reader to read and reread the proof.  I have actually worked it out 3 times for myself to ensure that I truly get it.  It feels powerful.  Furthermore, I'm only about half way through the book.  It is going to take me a while though.  I have to convince myself that I can reproduce everything before I move on to the next chapter.  Maybe I'm being hard on myself.  For those of you who seem to suggest that if you took high school algebra and geometry everything is peaches and cream....  I don't get it.  To read this book and really soak it in, one has to have the foundations of a true understanding of high school algebra and geometry.  That is a different animal.  It is easily attainable with the proper focus though.  I ask that you read this book and make the world a bettter place! ",1
"  In this day and age of the so called ""emo"" music and people who are so ignorant that they are calling groups like Def Leopard and Metallica punk music, it is refreshing to listen to a group that actually has talent.    Granted, Per Gessle's voice is not on par with someone like U2's Bono (but then again whose is?) but Mr. Gessele's song writting skills are  unique and the lyrics are good to sing along to in this day and age where actually writting your own songs is virtually extint.  We all remember ""It Must Have Been Love"" and ""Joyride"" from the good ole 90's.  It goes without saying that those two songs are well done.  However, not everyone may remember the little known ""Never Is A Long Time"", but this song is a hidden jewel.  ""Don't Bore Us, Get To The Chorus"" will definetely deliver your bang for your buck;  whether you are already a Roxette fan or just someone looking to try out some good music from a group that has talent, you won't be disappointed.  Why not try a group that does have talent, unlike the saccarine Britney Spears pop or Avril Lavinge's ""my-life-is-so-horrible"" punk music that does nothing but pollute the environment's airwaves.  Roxette is refreshing - a breath of fresh air.",0

"I read this book at the suggestion of my high school English teacher back in 1996, and find myself still aluding to it today.  He makes the argument that America's attention span has been shortened by television, among other things, and that this explains a good deal of our political history.Think about how the soundbite has limited the ability of American's to actively engage in political discussion;  how much you multitask now that you have IM and email and TV and radio and 30 seconds ads all blasting at the same time.A really intersting argument...

"""Winnie the Pooh ABC's"" is an original Winnie the Pooh story designed to teach rhyming, words and letters. Rather than straight, rote learning, this is presented in the form of a half-hour adventure. Things all get started when Christopher Robin introduces Pooh to a book of rhymes about the characters in the Hundred Acre Woods. Christopher Robin lets Pooh borrow the book and soon Pooh and all of his friends are learning about rhymes, words, reading and the alphabet, with some help from wise old Owl.One of the major complaints about this movie seems to be that it only introduces a few letters. If this is a concern for you or your child, then I recommend making sure you get the DVD version and not the video. It has a wonderful special feature that goes through the alphabet thoroughly, having the characters teach each letter in both upper and lower-case and associated words. Adults will probably get bored with this pretty quickly, but it'll be dead useful for your kid(s). There's also an ABC song with scenes from ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" that's quite worthwhile.Overall, if you want your kids to learn the alphabet, or just wanna see another good Pooh story, I'd say you can't go wrong with this, especially if you get the DVD version. Also included on the DVD version is a Fast-Play option and previews for movies such as ""Mulan II"" and ""Pooh's Heffalump Movie,"" as well as the original trailer both this and the 123s video / DVD.Was there anything else I wanted to say? Oh, bother. Think, think, think..",0
"I am a big Audioslave fan.  I felt the first CD was fantastic.The second CD was a lesser product, but still holds up on it's own.But for ""Revelations"", these guys appear to be hitting their stride as a musical foursome.  This CD is superb!  In my opinion, the only mediocre track is ""Until We Fall"".  Every other song is as good as anything Audioslave has ever done.  There are several tracks (Revelations, Sound Of A Gun & Jewel Of The Summertime) that are among the best Rock songs I've ever heard.  Tremendous CD.  This is one of the best CDs I own, and I own more than 400 of them.  I've had this CD since it was released, and I'm still listening to it to this day.  It never gets old.  If I were able to give it a ranking out of 100 stars I would give it 99 of 100.  Seriously!",0
"I've been seriously consuming Medeival literature for about a year now after my interest was re-awakened (I found out the Mythology & Folklore shelf at Barnes & Noble is a veritable treasure trove!)  I'd never read a saga before, but the Poetic Edda had convinced me that I would enjoy anything Norse or Icelandic.  Sagas of Icelanders is a huge, bulky book.  To get a book that size at such a reasonable price was a bargain I could not pass up.  The introductory material helps put a historical perspective on the sagas and prepares you for what to expect ... then the fun starts with Egil's Saga, which is the longest and possibly best in this collection.  Other reviewers have lamented the absence of Njal's Saga here - it is published seperately and was probably too long to include in this collection.  (Based on what folks have said though, I'm going to have to get Njal's Saga.)I am now a saga addict!  I devoured this book with amazing eagerness; each story is an engrossing page-turner.  I just couldn't stop reading them.  The style is intentionally simple with an economy of words and an emotional starkness that reminds me of Dashiell Hammett.  There's no chivalric nonsense or courtly fanciness to be found here.  The storytellers do not attempt to flatter their audience or paint their characters in a more positive light.  Characters are tragically stubborn, stupid, violent, irrational, sometimes even psychotic.  They can also be strong, noble, just, independent, faithful, practical, and hardy.  The sagas have a ""just the facts"" attitude that is unique in Medeival literature.  They are also unique in being epic-length prose instead of poetry, and having secular subject matter.  I have to wonder - these monumental works, produced in the Christian era but portraying semi-historical pagan characters in a sympathetic light - how did they get written?  Who wrote them and why?  Who was the intended audience?  This is the mystery of the sagas when the indroduction refers to them as a ""literary Stonehenge.""The world of the sagas is violent.  There's plenty of killing - sometimes for no apparent reason, but usually it's an act of revenge for a wrong, real or perceived.  One reviewer with an axe to grind has condemned this book as a ""distorted view"" of Icelandic history, but I think he misses the point of the collection.  It's not meant to be an accurate history; it's a sampler of Medeival sagas.  Consider how ""accurate"" a collection of two-fisted detective novels would be as history of early 20th-century America.  Literature is supposed to entertain.  Who wants to read about Grimwald the Meek who just stays on his farm and lives peacefully for 50 years?  That's not interesting.  The sagas are about interesting people who did remarkable things.But - again, strange for Medeival literature - most of the saga characters are NOT of noble blood.  They are often members of wealthy and influential families, but seldom are they royalty.  People in the sagas are not afraid to get their hands dirty.  They make their fortunes by working, trading (and going on Viking raids.)  You won't find Romance cliche's of idle kings and queens and knights here.  King Harald of Norway shows up often, but he's certainly not presented as much more than a successful warlord, and usually a tyrant.I was surprised but not especially disappointed to find a lack of ""mythology"" in the sagas.  There's a little bit of magic here and there, and a ghost or two, but little is said of the gods and even less of nature spirits, dragons, fairies, etc.  Compared to Celtic tales (like the ones in the Mabinogion, for instance) the sagas are firmly grounded in reality.One other caution:  I found myself sometimes bewildered by the Icelandic names and I had difficulty keeping track of who was who.  Most sagas tell a story of several generations of a family, and sons are named after grandfathers, and neighbors have the same names, and after a while you're floundering in a sea of Thorvalds and Thorgrims and Thorsteins and Snorris, etc etc ... and each one of them is a son of another Thorvald, Thorgrim, Thorstein, or Snorri and you lose track of who is who.  I had to do some page-flipping sometimes to look back and re-establish who a character was and what he had done earlier.  But other than that this was a quick and enjoyable read.It's interesting, it's huge, it's affordable:  If you don't buy it there's something wrong with you",1
I wanted a camera that the whole family could use - Including my 10 year old son. This camera has proven to be that and much more!  What impresses me the most is the astounding battery life and the quick focus features. It is at an excellent price point as well. Our pictures no longer suffer from the dreaded 'redeye' effects. I upgraded from a 4 year old Olympus4 megapixel camera and am blown away by the improvements over that period.Canon rocks,0

The printer's size was a little bigger than I expected but overall it is a good value purchase.  ",0
"Brown posits that cultural decline may NOT be inevitable for the West.  He's not pollyanna-ish about where we are on the ripeness curve, but he's refreshingly optimistic about the impact individual Christians can have by  being, in Jesus' words, the salt of the earth",1
"I cannot put into words the impact this book has had on me. This is my 4th translation of this text and this one is the best. Originally I started reading the Bhagavad Gita as it has a calibration of 910 (David Hawkins, Power vs. Force. It is a cosmic text which reaching out of the book and touches ones soul. This version is a joy to read. It is a dessert fresh from a tree. It is a day not too hot with gentle breezes. God becomes the companion rather than the gloom and doom king/parent/authority. Many of my friends now have this book just from seeing the joyful change in me.",1
"I'd put money that you've already seen the movie. What you wanna know is if the book is any good/better/different, right? I'd say different. For example in the book ""Donnie"" is much older, perhaps over forty - his kids are in high school, whereas as I recall Jonny Depp's Donnie was late twenties/early thirties perhaps, with pre-school-ish kids....Maybe that's not a big deal. A bigger difference is much of the tension in the book comes from one of Donnie's early connections and sparring partners, Tony, who feuds with Lefty over ""control"" of Donnie - this is a very important strand in Donnie's rise in the Mafia, and as I recall wasn't in the movie at all. Bottom line is there is far more in the book than the bare bones story told in the film, and it's a well told tale. Forgettaboutit, just buy it...",1
"If this is your first beading book you might find useful information here. If you've been beading for some time this book offers nothing, the projects are way too simple, more for kids than adults. It feels that the author is only starting with beading herself, she has not learned enough to teach others. There are so much better beading books out there, don't waste your money on this",1
"As you might have guessed, this is another cool game I have played in the arcade. AND IT ROCKS! Time Crisis 2 was wonderful but this is just outstanding. I mean, it has cooler graphics, more usable weapons(including grenades! YOWSERS!)better sound effects and above all such terrific explosions, shot hits, music and gameplay that it makes this the best Time Crisis Game I've ever played in my whole, entire (BEEP)ing life! When I played this in the arcade, I had tons and tons of fun. Why you think I put five stars for the fun rating? To make this game even more enjoyable, I used the fact I am a lover of animals and good people, most especially lions, tigers, jaguars and sexy women of all sorts. I imagined that those kinds of innocents mentioned were being threatened, that the enemy in the game was the poacher slime threatening them(as you know, I not only love big cats, all cool animals and decent human beings, I also HATE, HATE, HATE poachers!)and that I was the hero along with a sidekick who meant to save the women and the three large cat races. Needless to say, every time I killed an enemy, with bullet or grenade, I let loose the words: ""Go to hell, poacher scumbags!"" which of course made the game all the more enjoyable, as did saving lives which I imagined as either a big cat species or a beautiful woman. Anyway  whether you imagine this or not, this game is the best, coolest & most fun Time Crisis ever made and if you like shooting games or video games in general for that matter, you must either play this in the arcade(like me)or if you got a PS2, buy it and enjoy! I'd say it rivals the masterpiece that is Silent Scope, it's so perfect",0
"I have said it before but for give me, I am a West Reader.  This was the first West/Gates piece I read when I was in high school.  It started my love for social science learning.  The book not only is a piece of great insight on DuBois' ""The Talented Tenth and Guidging Hundreth"" but follows up on the topic with more indepth information on leadership in the African American race.  Reading it once will leave you stuck, in order to really get a real of what the words mean you must read it over and over and study it to see what DuBois was saying years ago and how West and Gates assists him in showing the need for leadership in the African American race",1
"Roland Topor's book about city life alienation is one of the most brilliant pieces of horror I've read in some time; while reading it I couldn't help it but find some parallels between Topor's book and Thomas Ligotti's own ""My Work is not yet Done"". Ligotti himself also happens to write a great introduction to this book's main course, focusing on the differences between ""pessimistic"" receivers of the Novel prize for literature and the REAL pessimist writers that go unnoticed. Also included is a selection of four previously unpublished short stories and a brief gallery representative or Roland Topor's ink drawings.But please, don't read Donna Di Giacomo's review on this page; I have no idea what she was thinking while writing it, but she pretty much fills it with SPOILERS for 75/80% of the novel, laying there for any unsuspecting readers to find and I have no idea why the amazon staff that usually checks these reviews before public viewing gave it the green light.. Fortunately for me I finished the book long before finding that spoiling wreck, but others might not be that lucky, and this is a very good book to have it mercilessly ruined like that",1
"The Corrs second CD TALK ON CORNERS put the Irish group further into the pop music stratosphere. It is easily their best album so far in their career. Filled with radio friendly hits like ""What Can I Do"", ""Only When I Sleep"", ""I Never Loved You Anyway"", ""So Young"" and a great cover of Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"". This Special Edition of the cd features their singles in remixed form. Also a bonus track, a remix of Runaway which was later rereleased as a single in 1999. Other highlights include ""Don't Say You Love Me"", ""Hopelessly Addicted"", ""When He's Not Around"" and ""Love Gives, Love Takes"". Overall a great pop album!",0
"Thsi set of tapes is wonderful.  If you are a fan of the Michael Chekhov Technique, or merely curious, the tapes are an opportunity to hear Michael Chekhov share the elements of his technique with a group of professional actors.  I have a set just for drive time in my car - they keep me very connected to the technique and Chekhov's artistic vision",1
"The recipes in this book consistently taste like the food I've enjoyed in Spanish restaurants.  Her chicken dishes are among the best I've made, and I am thrilled with how authentic the tapas dishes are.  The recipes are  easy to follow and most are fairly easy to prepare.  They are organized by  region rather than type of dish.  Although it is interesting to read about  the variations in regional cooking, the organization makes finding the  recipes you are looking for a bit more difficult...  but the results are  worth it.  I have a large collection of cookbooks, but this is one of the  few I use repeatedly",1
"I concur with the majority of reviews of this book. I have owned my hardcover copy for many years, and I've read it three times. Joe Klein did a good job. For most people, there is more here about Woody, his times, his friends and his foes and his sorrows than they will want or need to know. However, I must also advise true fans to consider buying another book, &quot;Woody, Cisco and Me&quot; by Jim Longhi. That one depicts only the WW II adventures when Woody and his friends took jobs feeding the crew and troops on merchant ships crossing the Atlantic in l943. It shows a side of Woody that Joe Klein's work does not, and both books should be read or owned by people with a serious interest in this wiry, weird genius",1
"""Her terrace was the sand/And the palms and the twilight"" -- and those are only the first two lines. Dipping into surrealism and imbued with spirituality, his poetry is compiled into ""The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens,"" which includes seven compilations of his work.Over his lifetime, Stevens wrote several books of poetry, but his exquisite poems are best taken by themselves: the lush grandeur of ""Sunday Morning,"" the hymnlike ""Le Monocle De Mon Oncle,"" and the humid grittiness of ""O Florida, Venereal Soil."" He takes multiple looks at ""Thirteen Ways of Looking At A Blackbird,"" and the lush ""Six Significant Landscapes.""In other poems, Stevens dips into outright surrealism, like in the delicate ""Tattoo"" (""There are filaments of your eyes/On the surface of the water/And in the edges of the snow""), and also adds a meditative bent into ""The Snow Man"" (""For the listener, who listens in the snow,/And, nothing himself, beholds/Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is"").If nothing else, Stevens' poetry can be read just because it is exquisitely beautiful. He lavished details all over almost every poem he wrote, and gave many of them the quality of a dream. His descriptions are simply written, but brilliantly laid out: ""When my dream was near the moon,/The white folds of its gown/Filled with yellow light.""His style tends to be a bit on the ornate side -- Stevens freely uses the more exotic terms -- such as ""opalescence,"" ""pendentives"" and ""muleteers"" -- wrapped up in complex verse, sometimes with a rhyme scheme and sometimes free-form. And lush detail is added to many of his poems, with descriptions of the moon, sun, plants and lighting, along with dazzling descriptions of the colors.But his writing is more than beautiful. Stevens' work often poses questions about death, life, religion, and art, taking the conventional and turning it on its head. His belief in the importance of his art is reflected in poems like ""Not Ideas About The Thing But The Thing Itself,"" which ends with the portentous lines: ""Surrounded by its choral rings,/Still far away. It was like/A new knowledge of reality.""Wallace Stevens is one of the most unique poets of the 20th century, and the sprawling ""Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens"" is a wonderful read",1
"Ok that title's kinda cheesy but I really don't care! Anyway, hi! I'm a sophmore in high school and we recently just wrapped up out fall musical ""The Music Man."" When I auditioned I had heard of it, but I had no real clue what it was about. I had the pleasure of playing Maud Dunlop...one of the Del Sarte Ladies. I fell in love with this musical from the start, and I just wanna tell you all about this wonderful soundtrack. So sit back and I hope you enjoy reading this review!Main Title/Rock Island/Iowa Stubborn 9/10 - The main title is basically just an instrumental of a few of the songs. Nothing special, but a good listen. Rock Island has to be one of my favorite track just because it's so much fun to listen to. The audience enjoyed this ""song"" every night during our performances. Iowa Stubborn is also fun to listen to. It can also get stuck in your head very easily. It's just one of those upbeat numbers that gets the musical going, but it is fun.Ya Got Trouble 10/10 - Wonderful! One of my favorites! It's just so well delivered and so funny. Our Harold Hill disappeared one practice, came back after about 15 minutes and had this entire song memorized! He was very good at it. It's a very enjoyable song...one of the best in the musical!Piano Lesson/If You Don't Mind Me Saying So 10/10 - I can't really say why I love this song, but there is just something about it so appealing. I absolutely love Marian's mother in this song, because she's just so bluntly funny. I also love Shirley Jones and her voice is just beautiful! A very fun song to listen to! I always had fun watching it when we rehearsed or performed.Goodnight My Someone 8/10 - Ehh...It's not a bad song, but kinda slow and dragging at times...by any means it's not horrible or anything it's very beautiful and wonderfully sung, but it can be boring in some spots. Otherwise very good and not a bad listen.Ya Got Trouble/Seventy-Six Trombones 9/10 - Great...I especially love the line ""Billiard parlor walls come a-tumblin' down!"" This is definitely the most famous song in the entire musical, and it's easy to see why. It's very energetic and very addictive. It so much fun to listen to and if you listen to the band behind the singing, they sound absolutely excellent!Sincere 9/10 - Gorgeous...It's not my favorite quartet song, but that doesn't mean it's bad. It's very beautiful and just takes you away when it begins to when it ends. Beautiful!The Sadder But Wiser Girl 8/10 - Not a bad song, but not the best. I do, however, enjoy the line ""I smile, I grin, when the gal with a touch of sin walks in."" It's a very addictive song, but a little too short if you ask me. Still a good listen, though. Pick-A-Little, Talk-A-Little 10/10 - I'm not giving this 10 outta 10 because it's my song, but because its so hilarious, and the quartet do and excellent job! I don't know what it is about a bunch of old women singing ""Pick a little, talk a little cheep cheep cheep..."" over and over again, but it's just so funny! I can just picture them pecking around resembling chickens to a T. It's a great song! I fully enjoy hearing Mrs. Shinn saying ""BAL-ZAC!"" It's so funny! One of my favorites!Marian The Librarian 9/10 - Love it! Very addictive! If you ever get a chance to watch this scene it the movie, take it! It's quite possibly the best scene in the entire film! The song is very enjoyable and quite funny when you listen to the words. I got to do a bit of a tango in our production. It was one of my favorite scenes. I also enjoyed how much rejection Harold was getting but he pressed on. Another wonderfully delivered song!Being In Love 8/10 - Again...Eh...I prefer ""My White Knight"" to be honest with you. This isn't my favorite song, but it's still beautifully sung thanx to Shirley Jones. Its a bit faster than you'd expect, but it's still not quite as enjoyable as ""My White Knight."" Still, not too bad.Gary, Indiana(Prof. Hill) 8/10 - This song is alright, but I get tired of hearing about Gary, Indiana, because I live in Indiana and Gary ain't all that good. I also quite enjoyed Winthrop's version a bit better. Also, it's a bit short. Still, it's okay for a listen once in a while.The Wells Fargo Wagon 10/10 - I love this song for some odd reason. I'm not really sure what it is, but it's just one of those songs you just like. It's just got that addictive sound to it that you can't get out of you head. Winthrop is just adorable! It's a definite favorite!Lida Rose/ Will I Ever Tell You 10/10 - Beautiful!! Absolutely beautiful! This is my favorite song by the quartet! It's so gorgeous! And ""Will I Ever Tell You"" is just as equaly wonderful. It's probably my favorite Marian solo. I love how they compliment eachother so well. I love listening to it so much! Our quartet was very talented and got standing ovations everynight. I highly recommend this track!Gary, Indiana(Winthrop) 9/10 - I think I enjoy this so much because of how cute Winthrop is! It's adorable! If it weren't for him I don't think I'd enjoy this song so much. It's a fun track!Shipoopi 10/10 - The best song in the movie and on the CD! You can't hate it! It's kinda like ""We Go Together"" from Grease...You could hear it over and over and over again and still love it every single time. It's just so energetic and fun. We had the most fun performing it everynight! This was everyone's favorite song! Simply awesome!Till There Was You 9/10 - My second favorite Marian solo, because it's just so gorgeous! I remeber hearing this in the movie The Wedding Singer and I didn't realize it was the same song until a month into rehearsal. It's a beautiful song. I enjoy it everytime. I remember our last night of performing the musical when Marian was singing this and out footbridge broke! it just crack in two pieces! it was hysterical! Anyway, this is a very good song! I love listening to it so much! Props to Shirley Jones, once again!Goodnight My Someone/Seventy-Six Trombones 8/10 - It's more relevent to the story than the soundtrack, but I like it because it's when Harold finally realizes he's in love and it's just really enjoyable.Seventy-Six Trombones 9/10 - This is basically just the closing number, but it's nice to just be able to enjoy the band without having to listen to all the singing. Then near the end they bring in the entire company and it still sounds wonderful. I think it was a great idea to open and close the sountrack with this song. It's just a great song!All in all this soundtrack is and excellent listen! I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks they would enjoy it! You will! I'm very happy to have been a part of this musical and I had a wonderful 2 months rehearsing for it! It was a wonderful experience! I hope you enjoyed reading this and I'll now let you get back to you lives! I also hope you enjoy ""The Music Man."" It is truely one of the greatest American musicals! Goodnight my someone, goodnight!~Your Haunted Angel",0
"As a Memphis native, I have heard B.B. on many occasions. Never have I seen or hear him play with the same passion he did here in 1964. The quality of the recording is outstanding, with Lucille giving the center-stage on many occasions. The clarity and quality is amazing for a forty year old recording. This is the live B.B. King recording to buy. The Cook County Jail performance from 1971 is a close second, but the quality is not nearly as good",0

"This is hands down the greatest book I have ever read, not including the Bible. I say that as a Christian and as an individual. I can understand how some choose to apply the concepts without the religion, but I personally think this would have infuriated SK.Again, not including the Bible, ""The Sickness Unto Death"" is perhaps the only literary work I have ever read that altered my life, either by perception or action.His elaborations on the various forms of despair should hit everyone, as there are several, each applicable to each personality.If anyone were to ask me to recommend a single work, this would be it.I must add, that I have not read scores of philosophy, only a handful. I say that to say this. This book may seem somewhat difficult to understand at first, but it gets easier the more you read and the more accustomed you get to SK's style. Once the first few pages regarding the definition of self have been comprehended, the rest falls beautifully into place.",1
"If you were a Spice Girls fan, this would be good reading.  Get to know the facts that you never knew was going on during the Spice Girls' careers, what life was like for Mel B as a child to her mid-20s, her marriage & divorce, solo music, and what she had planned to do after the dwindling spice career.  The only con I can say about this book is that she is too young to have written a truly grasping autobiography. She's only been through 20-odd years of life",1

"This book is the good non-technical introduction to the implications of String Theory.  The theme of the book is that String Theory implys there are a very large number of possible vacuum states ( sets of physical laws ).  Our world is just one of these vacuum states. Each different vacuum state would have different sets of elementary ( sub-atomic ) particles and forces.  However, String Theory is still a long way from being strongly supported by experimental evidence.  This evidence may or may not be discovered over the next century. However, I do not think it really has much to say about the existance or non-existance of an intelligent, purposeful god.  In my my opinion, human knowledge is, and always will be, too limited to make final statements about the nature of god and the universe.  Large unprovable statements about the nature of the world are more likely to be a reflection of the character of the the individual making them.  You see what you choose to see.  This is only human nature and everyone does this to some extent.  Never the less, as a non-technical physics book I recommend this highly",1

"It's interesting how the negative reviewer below can speak of ""delving"" into so many styles of music, yet evidently came into this album with a pre-conceived notion of what it should be.  This album makes no claim or attempt to be ""classical"" Indian music, except for maybe the last track.  This album IS a fresh collaboration among some of the world's most talented performers (Indian and otherwise) that had my jaw firmly planted on the ground from the moment I hit ""play"".  Hearing traditional Indian instrumentation combined with western production proved to me that nirvana or a great album of any style can only be obtained with an open mind.  Absolutely amazing.  10 stars...   ",0

"This is the first Sue Miller novel I have read. I picked it up from my wife's collection of unread novels when I had run out of my usual suspense/thrillers. To my surprise I found myself very quickly caught up in the story and the characters. Sue Miller is an excellent writer. She has a good eye for the details of domestic life and family dynamics which provide a good backdrop for the mysteries and secrets of vet Jo Becker. Jo is in an apparently happy marriage to Daniel, a minister. It's her second marriage. One day a friend from the past shows up as a client at her vet clinic. This leads us on a journey through Jo's memories of a time in the 60s when she escaped from her first marriage and lived in a group home/commune in Cambridge Mass. This hippy period of her life ends with the tragic murder of one of her roommates by a person or persons unknown. In the present Jo learns the identity of the killer, someone with whom she is tempted to stray until she learns his terrible secret. Jo wrestles with her conscience and reveals all to her husband who is shocked more at her intent to betray him than he is by the murderer's identity. How Jo deals with these challenges is dealt with in a well crafted way.I highly recommend this novel",1

"This CD's tracks are a good representation of the post-war Django, after he had been exposed to the emerging be-bop style and phrasing. Here, Django and extraordinary violinist Stephane Grappelli record some of their classics with three Italian jazzmen (piano, bass and brushed snare-drum), providing a somewhat different feel from the sound of his guitar-dominated 1930's Hot Club days.For ""generalist"" jazz fans, this CD will give a nostalgic taste of rhythms, textures and sounds of another time - delivered by the best. For Django and Stephane's aficionados, these tracks are a gem. Django's playing is red hot yet polished, crisp and precise, and continues to amaze for the sheer richness of his inexhaustible ideas both as a soloist and an accompanist. Stephane once again proves why he was the indisputed genius of the jazz violin - never missing a beat, a quarter-tone or an opportunity to say something fresh, new and heartfelt.The all-Italian rhythm section is in style and non-intrusive, allowing the two stars to express themselves to the fullest while providing great steady support. The occasional piano solo is delivered beautifully in a very personal style, with techniques clearly reminiscent of a strong classical background.Sound-wise, a great effort was made to rid the old recording of white noise and hissing. I am extremely pleased with the result - Django's Selmer guitar and Stephane's magic violin come across crisp and clear. Listen to ""Minor Swing"" or ""I'll never be the same"" if you want to get a chill up your spine. This CD helps understand why Django is, to this day, the most influential jazz guitarist who ever lived",0

"Excellent and brilliantly witty and dry series of lecture courses on literature from the master, Vladimir Nabokov. In this volume, Nabokov fights against all interpretive lenses, he denounces the sociological, political, and autobiographical perspectives on literature, arguing that a true reader should pay attention to the detail of the author's narrative, to the artistry and creativity, and not get drawn into banal generalizations. He writes that ""the novels in this series are supreme fairy tales"" (pg. 2). According to Nabokov, good reader should:1.	Have an imagination2.	Have a memory3.	Have a dictionary4.	Have some artistic senseIn this volume, Nabokov lectures on a wide variety of great literature, including Jane Austin's `Mansfield Park,' Charles Dickens' `Bleak House,' `Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson (an unusual choice at the time), `Madame Bovary' by Flaubert, Proust's great `a la recherché,' `the Metamorphosis,' by Kafka, `Ulysses,' by Joyce, and an excellent essay called `The Art of Literature and Commensense.' This volume is filled with pleasurable surprises, especially the marvelous facsimiles of Nabokov's lecture preparations with complete annotations, and many wonderful diagrams and illustrations of the works analyzed. He has some great drawings of Gregor Samsa the beetle, and the floor-map of his apartment. It really helps the reader appreciate the work unlike the bulk of literary criticism, which seeks to mystify and empower the interpreter. This is a true appreciation of the novel form, and a classic of lit criticism from one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. His depth and breadth of understanding and attention to detail will astound you.    ",1
"What an enjoyable book! It is so intelligently done, and provides so many satisfying answers for this curious reader. It is not a book version of the movie, nor is it an advertisement for the movie. It is truly _complimentary to_ the movie. Everything in the book should be interesting to anyone who would be interested in the movie, and vice versa, but there is practically no overlap. It is almost as if the filmmakers gathered and organized the material that they thought would be interesting to people who like crossword puzzles, and sorted it out into two piles, one labelled ""cinematic"" and one labelled ""literary"" (or ""cruciverbal?""), and made the movie using the material in one pile and the book using the material in the other.It illustrates the different editing styles by showing puzzles edited by Margaret Farrar, Will Weng, Eugene Maleska, and Will Shortz. It illustrates the ascending difficulty level by giving New York Times puzzles from Monday through Sunday. (I'm not a puzzle fanatic, I'd always assumed the Sunday puzzle was the _hardest_). It gives a number of examples of some puzzles that champion solvers and enthusiasts considered their favorites. And I like them, too. In a way this book is a ""best crossword puzzles""--as chosen by the people you saw in the movie.It also gives you a chance to solve the puzzles that flashed by in the movie, including the ""Wordplay"" puzzle itself, and the puzzles that Ellen Ripstein solved to win the championship. It gives information on how people construct puzzles, and what the rules for a properly constructed puzzle are considered to be. It gives directions for submitting puzzles to the Times--even telling us that the Times pays $135 for a daily puzzle, and $700 for a Sunday puzzle.I think that anyone who enjoys crosswords would enjoy this book regardless of whether or not they had not seen the movie, although of course the book makes you want to see the movie (and vice versa)",1

"I recently watched part of the movie on MTV and was so impressed by the acting and singing that I bought the movie.Watching the movie brought back alot of memories.  My pal Louie was a HUGE fan.I was more of a psychedelic rock guy.My how times do change.I first bought some other Temps cd of 16 recordings which were not original .  So I bought this here and WHOAH. I am now a HUGE  fan. The talent of these guys was truly inspired.

"The scathing review obviously had some axe to grind. And ignore the fact that the author is French, and that weird author's photo. The fact is, this is a very good, sensible book, and while it is true that there is some stereotying involved, the author's conclusions are often quite profound.",1
"I loved this book! As an author, Ray Kurzweil isn't afraid to delve into the difficult task of attempting to foresee the future. Kurzweil receives plenty of criticism by those who find his predictions about the direction of future technological progress hard to fathom. Some complain his visions are scary, depressing, or otherwise miss the mark for some reason. I found The Age of Spiritual Machines to be an optimistic, comforting, entertaining and well researched look at some likely implementations of future technology.Kurzweil has a very respectable background in the computer hardware and software field and is undoubtedly qualified to throw his visions about the future into the ring. He supports his notions with ample research and evidence. This book isn't proposing to tell you exactly what's going to happen in the next ten years; rather it's following current and past trends and logically extending them into the future. In many respects the future is simply what results from decisions we make today. Kurzweil helps us consider our alternatives and future results based on a look at currently available technology and the trends in future development.",1

"This is a very well-designed and well-made reading light. The LEDs are very bright and provide a nice white light, suitable for reading or to serve as a hands-free flashlight. The lights can be rotated thru a small axis up or down (maybe 45 degrees) so you can aim it perfectly. Since the lights are LED the batteries should last much longer than other bulbs.The only problem I had with this light was that I originally only bought one and my wife liked it so much I had to surrender it often.

"I've been in muscle heaven for the past four months, watching and rewatching some of my favorites from these 50 sword and sandals sagas. One fabulous revelation is the discovery of Mark Forest, probably the most phenomenal looking Hercules of them all--with the exception of the Man-Who-Looks-Like-A-God, Steve Reeves. Forest was massive, with a beautifully shaped face, head and of course, that incredible torso of bulging pecs and ridged abs. He also conveyed a powerful sensuality lacking in nearly all of the musclemen you see here. His amazing physique is starred in ""Kindar the Invunerable"" and ""Hercules Against the Mongols."" Also contained in this collection is the ultimate valentine dedicated to Steve Reeves, ""Giant of Marathon"" where his fabulous torso is exploited from the first frame to the last. Lucky for us, he plays most of the picture in a very brief white loincloth which emphasizes his phenomenal body. At the beginning, there's a scene where he is crowned with a wreath of olive leaves as his fellow Olympian warriors look on. Reeves steps forward and your mouth drops for his body is lit and glows beyond belief. This is the best investment I've ever made in purchasing a DVD collection. You're able to watch and compare all the muscle men who went over to Italy in the early 60s: Reg Park, Don Vardis, Gordon Scott, Gordon Mitchell and all the others. This is a collection to treasure and hope for a follow-up sequel that will contain the rest of Mark Forest and Steve Reeves body of work",0

"A Match Made In Heaven: How Singles And The Church Can Live Happily Ever After by Wendy Widder is a compelling and timely recommendation of how unmarried, divorced, and widowed parishioners and the Christian church can and should serve one another better. Though the community churches have traditionally been family-oriented, an unfortunate yet common occurrence is that these churches have begun to substitute programs for relationships when it comes to the unmarried. A Match Made In Heaven is an inspired and inspiring exploration of positive alternatives to enhance and strengthen the bond of the single person with the rest of the Christian congregation through the auspices of the community church",1

"Dr. Sun explained how to achieve a successful career from many angles - as a manager, a report or a peer.  He explained the theory on how human brain works during interacting with others and how to use the theory to your advantage - open yourself up and be direct in order to help others  perceive you early and perceive you well. He emphasizes that you should not be shy to expose your career passion.  People admire the courage when someone shows his desire and will never look down on him if he failed. A manager definitely offers a career opportunity to the one who showed his desire for it.  This even applies to personal relationship:  I tend to make friends with people who showed to like to be my friend too.      If I read this book earlier, I would have be more successful in my career.  But it is never to late to fix something.  I especially recommend this book to people who are starting a new career.

"As a committed Progressive Jew who fluctuates between Reform and Reconstructionist affiliation, I was glad to stumble upon Michael Meyer's excellent history of the Reform Movement.  Meyer traces the development of Reform from the early years in Hamburg and Berlin to recent decisions made the Central Conference of American Rabbis.  In so doing, he explodes a number of horrific myths that Orthodox &quot;Judaism&quot; lobs at Reform: that significant numbers of Reform congregations shifted their main day of worship to Sunday; that the movement is simply &quot;watered down&quot; Judaism; that Reform Jews are simply &quot;lapsed&quot; Jews who would be Orthodox if they didn't find it difficult or knew more about Judaism.  Meyer also shows that, just as there are and have been important movements and currents within &quot;Orthodoxy&quot;, there were and are many different movements and currents within Reform.  The discussions of the movement's growth and foment on German soil, and the transfer of that foment to the United States, are particularly enlightening",1
"I was thrilled (but not surprised*) by the fluidity of the prose.  I couldn't put it down.  It's an easy read.  It's engaging.  You're constantly wondering what Janice is going to do next.  It's a real page-turner.  ... a highly descriptive tale of being a teenager in the New York of the 80's.Note:  The book is unapologetic about her drug use, sexual freedom and other life choices.  They were just a fact of her experience.  A parent might want to read it first, if they find these topics unacceptable.  Personally, I am giving this to my 16 y.o. niece.  I believe my teenage niece has a solid grasp on what is healthy for her.  This story is about a brave young woman who made some good choices and other not-so-good choices.  It's reality.  It's life.  The heroine is very courageous.  I think all teenagers need the encouragement that this book provides - the courage to face your fears and face the choices you must make.  Growing up is scary.While reading, I was sometimes very jealous.  Janice got to go to Danceteria and hang out in Washington Square when she cut class.  Meanwhile, her mother blithely let her check into a group home.  I was never as brave as Janice.  Unlike Ms. Erlbaum, it took me years and years to finally find ""home.""Like me, her friends were fake and the teenage Janice was sometimes a complete jerk.   High School can truly suck, in every era and any location.  We can all relate - even if your teenage years seem so much more or less  ""damaging"" in comparison.   In essence, this book is a fascinating tale of a strength and courage to ""raise yourself"" and find some place or state of mind that you can finally call ""home.""

"Christianity In The Academy: Teaching At The Intersection Of Faith And Learning distills the wisdom of author Harry Lee Poe (Charles Colson Professor of Faith and Culture, Union University), who also serves as the program director for the C. S. Lewis Foundation's Summer Institutes, a training resource on faith and scholarship issues especially for Christian Faculty. Wrestling with serious issues confronting Christian educators in institutions of higher learning, Christianity In The Academy touches upon the Christian worldview, interdisciplinary dialogue, the religious spectrum that can be found in higher education, the repercussions of the postmodern age, and much more. Tackling difficult dilemmas of faith and academics seemingly at odds, Christianity In The Academy is an opinionated but thoughtful resource recommended for personal contemplation among college educators of all levels who share a common bond through faith in Jesus Christ",1
"Written within the tradition of cultural and media studies, this book offers a wonderful resource for those interested in critical approaches to ethnographic sudies on audiences.  The four chapters that constitute the  first section present an  in depth  critical discussion of the assumptions  of previous theories, research, and measuring methods used by traditional  academic and commercial analysis of audiences. They situate the debate  about audiences in the realm of the consumption of TV as a domestic  experience and point out the limitation of those traditions which  decontextualized the audience from their consumption environment. The  second section provides strong evidence of how women negotiate cultural and  personal meanings when watching TV. One of the articles, for example,   deconstructs the traditional premise that portrays them as passive and  alienated viewers of soap operas. This section intends to offer a solid  theoretical basis to understand how gender is related to media consumption  by giving actual examples of ethnographic interpretive research. The last  section situates media reception in the complex landscapes of globalization  systems. It emphasizes how local audiences &quot;localize&quot; global  media by re-interpreting those &quot;global&quot; media in their local  experiences, challenging the thesis of global cultural homogeneization hold  by some traditions in sociology and media studies. Finally, I want to point  out that the value of this book is not only the relevance of the topics  that are addressed, but the solid academic base that supports their main  thesis. Moreover, among the virtues of it, I can name the clarity of the  language, the well organized exposition of complex ideas and, of course,  the passion of the discussion that will definitely involve even those  readers with no previous expertise in media or cultural studies literature.   This book can definitely have a place with important advances in media and  cultural studies such as  David Morley's Television, Audiences and  CulturalStudies  or Shaun Moores' Interpreting audiences",1

"Charles Haddon Spurgeon was born in 1834 and was converted at the age of  16.  By the age of 17, he was already adept enough in the Word of God that  he was called to shepherd one of the  local churches.  During his lifetime,  he published over 1900 different sermons.  Each was original and  thought-provoking.  Those who have read his sermons know that each message  was filled with the Word of God and sought to bring honor and glory to  Christ alone. The teaching done by Spurgeon in these 28 lectures is a skill  that has almost completely vanished from among pastor-teachers today.  This  443 page book reflects just one reason why he was called, &quot;The Prince  Of Preachers&quot; and &quot;A Master Pulpiteer.&quot; Spurgeon's teachings  and messages will go on in Christendom as being revelant to any age in any  decade.  The ministerial student will do well to study these lectures and  seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit in applying them to their ministry.   The experienced minister should also take the time out of often hectic  schedules to study what made this &quot;Prince of Preachers&quot; a prince  among preachers. No minister should ever be able to find fault with this  classic.  This contents of this book and the author should never be  considered to be &quot;out-of-date&quot; and &quot;not up-to-par in this  modern world.&quot; It is a timely piece which I thoroughly enjoyed.

This is an excellent and very informative account of Berkeley's theory of vision - a topic that deserves to be studied on its own and not only (as has often been the case) as a minor side of his subjective idealism.

"All of the underlying themes of Trollope's work are in this book; (1) the underlying strength of women; (2) the weakness of men; (3) and the portrayal of how people manipulate, or attempt to manipulate each other.This book has well-developed characters - as always with Trollope, including a young woman who is seeking to marry a rich man, a rich lord, two rich men who are members of the upper class (but one rung below the lord), a successful farmer, a lawyer, an heiress and a couple of nice people.  The book has two successful love stores (Reginald/Mary and Rufford/Penge) and three failed love stories (Twentyman/Masters; Trefoil/Rufford and Trefoil/Morton).  It deals honestly with the emotions of all concerned.  Every scene is put together with the thoughtful approach of Trollope, who never lets any strand of the plot dangle.What makes this book unusual is Senator Gotobed, who is on a visit from America.  The Senator speaks frankly about everything and often offends his English hosts.  His comments bring buried tensions to the surface.  I ended up admiring the Senator because of his fearlessness and outspokenness.  He is, of course, ridiculous and Trollope was having a bit of fun by introducing him to the story",1
"James H. Wilbanks has written one of the finest military histories to date of the final two stages of the Vietnam War: the period from the Tet Offensive in 1968 to the American withdrawal in 1972, and the bitter end game, 1972-1975. A retired U.S. Army officer and a professor at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, Wilbanks focuses much of his attention on the Nixon Administration's strategy of strengthening the Armed Forces of South Vietnam (RVNAF) while at the same time withdrawing American forces from the war. Known as ""Vietnamization,"" the goal of the program was to make the RVNAF capable of standing alone against its Communist opponents. Why Vietnamization failed just two years after the United States withdrew its forces from Vietnam on 29 March 1973 is the central question of the book.Drawing on an impressive range of primary and secondary sources, Wilbanks charts the course of Vietnamization from its origin in 1969 until the fall of Saigon in 1972. In addition to providing superb summaries of the major military campaigns fought by the RVNAF during this period, Wilbanks also delves into some of the political-military elements of the story. We learn, for example, that General Creighton W. Abrams, the Commander of the U.S. Military Assistance Command Vietnam, warned the Nixon Administration in a 2 September 1969 memo that Vietnamization ""would not permit"" the South Vietnamese to handle the combined threat of a North Vietnamese invasion and the insurgency in the South (28).  The main reasons for his pessimistic outlook were ""poor leadership, high desertion rates, and corruption in the upper ranks of the RVNAF"" (28).All the same, Nixon's Defense Secretary, Melvin Laird insisted on going forward with the strategy even though the ""best that the United States could hope for was to build-up the South Vietnamese so that they could hold on for at least a decent interval after the American troops had been withdrawn"" (28). Laird had to reject Abrams's assessment because accepting it would have meant admitting ""that the United States could never gracefully exit Vietnam"" and achieve Nixon's goal of ""peace with honor"" (28).            In the end, Wilbanks reveals that Vietnamization ""achieved neither peace nor honor""(4). Beginning with the Operation Lam Som 719 debacle in 1971 and ending North Vietnam's invasion of South Vietnam in 1975, Abandoning Vietnam carefully analyzes the final battles of the RVNAF. It is not a pretty story, but there were some shining moments such as the 1972 Easter Offensive, when the RVNAF managed to hold on against a 14-division North Vietnamese attack. Wilbanks, who fought at the besieged city of An Loc during this campaign, attributed much of the success of the RVNAF in 1972 to the presence of American advisors on the ground combined with American air power and naval gunfire support. Three years later when these American elements were not available to ""save South Vietnam"" (160), Saigon fell in a mere 55 days.            As much as he criticizes Nixon's Vietnamization program, Wilbanks does not completely condemn the concept of America training a developing country's army to defend itself and its nation. Had Vietnamization been applied in 1965, or 1963 for that matter, rather than 1969, the RVNAF might have survived longer or perhaps even achieved a lasting stalemate similar to Korea. Instead, the Johnson Administration relegated the RVNAF to a secondary role 1965 and ""Americanized"" the war. By introducing large numbers of U.S. troops into Vietnam to bear the brunt of the heavy combat between 1965 and 1968, the Johnson Administration not only retarded the natural growth and development of the RVNAF, but indoctrinated it in a style of war inappropriate for the military of a lesser developed country: big unit operations that relied heavily on advanced technology and firepower. As retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Douglas Kinnard put it, ""we erroneously tried to impose the American system on a people who didn't want it, couldn't handle it and may lose because they tried it"" (287).            A far better approach, Wilbanks points out, would have been to train the RVNAF in small unit, counter-insurgency warfare. Not only would this approach have made the RVNAF more mobile and capable of dealing with the demands of guerilla warfare-the predominant form of warfare between 1963 and 1968-but it also would have made it less dependent on the United States for technology, ammunition, and advisors. Wilbanks argues that a counter-insurgency force with extensive battle experience, sound leadership, and a proven track record of operating independently of foreign advisors had a better chance of transforming itself into a modern, conventional army than one hamstrung by a history of dependency on American military assistance and know-how. Such a force also would have been more accustomed to fighting with maneuver and light arms as opposed to heavy firepower and high technology-useful competencies to posses when American military assistance began to dry up after 1973.But in the final analysis, Wilbanks contends that the South Vietnamese ""deserve a large part of the blame themselves"" (287). To succeed, a military force must be led ""by men of courage and skill, and have purposes worth fighting and dying for"" (288). Without those critical ingredients, the best intentions in the world are meaningless.This is sobering tale told by balanced, exacting scholar. The level of Wilbanks's research not only meets the bar of most current scholarly publications, but exceeds it in many areas, especially his use of U.S. Army documents. Wilbanks carefully builds each of his major arguments with the best available evidence, and is careful to employ historiography from all sides of the political spectrum in making his case. One will find, for instance, quotations from Marxist scholars and U.S. Army generals in the same paragraph, making nearly identical observations about the war. In short, Wilbanks's history of the period along with Jeffrey J. Clarke's Advice and Support: The Final Years, 1965-1973 will stand out as a seminal account of the period for many years to come.",1
"""Pythagoras' Trousers:  God, Physics & The Gender Wars,"" Margaret Wertheim, NY, Random House, 1995  ISBN: 0-8129-2200-Xm HC  280 pgs., (10 pgs. Biblio., Index 18 pgs.),  9 1/2"" x 6 1/4""An Australian writer with BS major in physics & BA major in math, Wertheim writes with exemplary literary style & credits include science/tech writings for TV, Radio, & consequential magazines.Her thesis is summarized in the book's last sentence: ""The time has come for a mathematically based science envisioned and practiced equally by both sexes.""  Literally, this equates to physics being historically & currently still dominated by males (in same fashion as Catholic Priesthood bars women) & whose mission or quest in finding the Theory of Everything (TOE) is misdirected & financially irresponsible - but that society would benefit by having the woman's touch or participation by virtue of females having been acculturated differently.The author quite brilliantly reviews & chronicles the sciences of math-based astronomy & physics with respect to who, what, where, why & how important findings arose & were received by populace, Popes or ""religiosa"", & fellow scientists from ancient times to the present - noting & documenting the all but rare females of science who were, in effect, banned by decree or barred from participation.  Those female exceptions (Marie Curie, etc.) are exposed in considerable detail, fully noting their censures, the hostile criticisms & limitations under which they were forced to function.  The book is written largely from a feminist's viewpoint, one who has thoroughly documented the cause celebre.  I'd disagree with the author's desire to abdandon the quest for the General Unified Theory (GUT) or TOE as too expernsive & socially irresponsible.  The book title's reference to his trousers is given in Chapter 1.  It is a very good read & we obtain a good account of religion & science, at times wed & other times waging war with the other.",1

"I finished re-reading this book yesterday and am suffering withdrawal pains.  This book is one of those sorts of fantasies that works as it should, filled with magic, romance, devious plans, fortune telling, sword fighting, disowned royalty, and the sort of plot that makes you eager to read what happens next.Given, the the writing is not top notch.  And yes, as one reader pointed out, Vesputo as a villian's name is a total cliche.  The first few times I tried to read this book I couldn't because the first chapters unfold awkwardly.  However, as the author seems to get into the swing of things, the story improves and makes for a very good read.The story is of a seer and a prince of a conquered country.  The seer is princess, her father conquered the prince's country, and he is presented as slave to the girl, who frees him.  A friendship, and romance, develops; the evil villain plots several murders, people escape, make friends with kings, save the world, tell the future, and fall in love.  A wholesome, good fantasy. While there are some rather ridiculous points in the story (men becoming friends as ""tears stand in their eyes"", help coming in the nick of time, merely just ""seeing the future"" and saving the world) it is nonetheless a good read.  The words Hanley uses are creative and well chosen and the plot, though not unique necessarily, is good.  It would have been better to have fleshed out the story; it ended too quickly when so much more could have been said and done, and some things happened too fast and the author told too many things rather than letting the reader see these things (we were told they became friends, we could not see the friendship form). Still, I quite, quite enjoyed it and recommend this to anyone looking for a fantasy, in particular young, romantically-minded girls",1

"Juno Reactor is awesome.  Their music would fit in the trance category, but it doesn't wear on you like a lot of repetitive music in the genre, and it isn't overly trippy.  They best way to describe their music is that it is trance, but with more substance.  Case in point: listen to the sample of Conga Fury or God Is God; the pseudo-Middle Eastern female vocals in the background add a cool texture to the music and elevates it beyond most music in the category.  Also look at the ratings: they don't lie.  Highly recommended.  Also, if you are into the Juno Reactor sound, try S.U.N. Project.  The two rank at the top of my trace list",0
"It's sad to think the state that America is in right now, with hardly a new voice of reason to combat it. Allen Ginsberg made sense when he wrote and he makes sense now. But has anything changed?

"I've just finished rereading this courageous and deeply personal journey, and it's still lingering with me as I type this review.  I wasn't in the same mindset the first time I picked up the book many years ago, therefore I felt a bit on the peripheral in identifying with Alice. I have since embarked on my own soulful expedition that's lasted several years thus far, and I've come to realize that to truly find my inner core, it must be done alone and it must often be a raw, painful process. I don't let &quot;them&quot; tell me it isn't. It's not for the weak willed, and certainly not for the person who NEEDS people to survive.  I have reached many of the revelations that Alice achieved, and they were hard won battles indeed, but am convinced worth it in the end.  Alice's message, and my own experience, is to give in to the the power to BE!  For me, it's rejoicing in the most basic aspects of being alive when the veil of despair darkens my vision - the ability to take deep cleansing breaths, the range of graceful motion my physicality allows me, exploring my inner universe, quietly surveying my surroundings, loving my animal companion, trusting the ability to take care of myself, and knowing that nothing in this life is etched in stone, except my demise. I've taught myself to pay closer attention to the way I interact with others and, surprisingly to me, there's a compassion I didn't realize was there, and wouldn't have had I not undertaken this private excavation. Alice, I hope you're still among us.  Thank you",1

"Francis Jennings, long associated with the Newbury Library American Indian collections has brought his vast knowledge to bear on the subject of the Iriquois as the fearsome 5 or 6 nations who independently cowed both their  fellow tribes and the English and French colonists. He proves it wasn't so  with so many documents of which we have never heard in our schoolbook  history texts that I wonder how such material escaped notice previously. In  the process he slays some American Sacred Cows such as Francis Parkman. One  learns that the Indian frontier was no such thing and didn't exist but was  a commonly inhabited piece of terrain, peopled by various tribes and the  European invaders who traded with them. Relations were, for the most part,  reasonably amicable, which accounts for the fact that during later wars the  Eastern Indians frequently exhibited what we call civilized treatment of  enemies and prisoners. (Of course there were the exceptions, usually well  justified.) But in the beginning, the Dutch, Swedes, English and French,  all found it necessary to deal with the various tribes quite diplomatically  in order to survive, and use them in their wars of empire with one another.  Furs in return for trade goods were king.  The undoubted reality is such a  vast contrast with the accepted picture of our frontier that this book, as  well as Jennings others in this series, should be required reading to  repair the damage done in our schools by claptrap such as Parkman and other  revered historians who followed his lead, writing off the Indians as  barabarians and the frontier as a clearly delineated line across which  whites stepped only if they were willing to take their lives into their  hands. Instead we find two cultures living amicably in common communities  up until the first half of the 1700's when the balance was upset by driving  out the Indians such as the Delewares and Shawnees so that they located in  the Ohio country and became relatively independent. The Iriquois had a  large hand in this and it was their undoing. Read the book. It is a  complicated subject but well worth digesting. I recommend reading it in  small doses and having an atlas nearby",1
"If you are interested in how FDR turned the country around and infused it with a sense of optimism, replacing fear and confusion with purpose and concrete plans, read this book.

"I actually prefer this novel of Anne Bronte to her sister's ""Wuthering Heights.""  However, having just read the Penguin Classics edition of ""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall"" I have to say that the ""explanatory"" notes were much more than just explanatory. Now, I know that Stevie Davies is a professor herself, but I wish she would leave the interpretation for the reader rather than giving her own in the notes. I've noticed this trend to interpret and analyze rather than just ""explain"" in recent editions of Penguin and Oxford, but this example struck me particularly. I can see how some might find this helpful, but there were places in the text when I was actually wondering to what the reference might be but found no note explaining it. Rather Davies focuses on Bronte's feminism, which, though potentially helpful, forces a certain interpretation and analysis on the reader that should be left in the introduction and necessarily leaves out other aspects of the text that Davies may or may not find interesting. I don't disagree with her interpretation; it just took a lot of the fun out of reading the novel when I would turn to the back pages and find the thinking done for me. ",1

"I look forward to Paul Campos' articles more than any others. Whether he addresses the topics of academia, jurispridence or even football, he argues with razor precision and mixes in just the right touch of humor. As an attorney with a  belief that the system does work, I am hesitant to agree with assertions that American law is &quot;madness.&quot; There is nothing outlandish or over the top with Mr. Campos' reasoning, however. He draws me in with his arguments, and in my determination to refute them I often fall short. He plays an important role when he shines the spotlight on the system I admire so much. He's worth reading. He's challenging and has the courage of his convictions",1

"I reviewed the original text of this book a few years ago and commented it would be nice to see an updated version... it seems someone was listening and here we are with a reprint and updated version. We get the original text which covers sightings of bigfoots from 1818 up to 1980, continentwide. Now included is coverage from 1981 to 2004. Again, this may be the best book out there for the casual reader as you get a wide variety of coverage covering 'typical' sightings to the ufo/paranormal angle. This new addition doesn't cover every single incident of the last 25 years but gives a very nice cross-section of more current sightings. Once again in the back is a chronological listing of over 1000 sightings only reformatted. Unfortunately this list is from the original and does not include the new addition section. To counteract that though are some new photos throughout the book that I've never seen before, most intriguing is the picture on page 27 of an unknown shot-dead creature, it's hard to figure out what it is but it's very intriguing. Once again, excellent book for all and this is the book a casual reader would want to read",1

"The Glenn Miller Army Air Force Band was far and away the best band that Miller ever fronted, and the evidence of that is overwhelming on these four discs.  What clinches it for me is the version of ""Star Dust,"" where the combination of strings and Miller's trademark reed section is absolutely breathtaking.  This would have been the sound that Miller would have carried back to the US with him had he lived, and in my opinion the Big Band era would not have died as quickly.  This is a must for any collection",0
"The first thing that needs to be said about this movie is that it should be taken as a historical piece and not indicative of the life of many if not most nuns today.  Yes, there are still cloistered nuns that follow the strict rules of silence depicted here.  However, for example, the hospital nun who visited my mother as she was dying lived in her own apartment in town, didn't wear a habit, and seemed to me to be much more interested in the people she was serving than in following onerous rules of piety.That said, 'The Nun's Story' certainly comes in among the 1000 best movie ever made.  It is a very powerful drama, with flawless performances by the main characters.  In most ways, it fairly accurately depicts the pre Vatican II Catholic Church.  Since Vatican II, a lot has changed, and this change is spotlighted by this film when comparing Sister Luke's life with that of most nuns today.  In a lot of ways, Sister Luke's convent was similar to the Pharisees so vividly depicted in Scripture.  They were so concerned with following every letter of the Law that they failed to perceive and serve the real, everyday needs of the people.   They were so focused on serving God that they forgot that Jesus said that 'if you have done it to the least of these (people), you have done it to Me.'  This is not to suggest in any way that the sisters were not really sincere in their desire to serve God; indeed, their desire, and the sacrifices they willing made, needs to be admired.  I think Sister Luke would have made it as a nun today.  Of course there are still rules and disciplines that need to be observed.  But, as Jesus told the Pharisees, if a cow is stuck in a pit on the Sabbath, you forget the rules about only resting on the Sabbath and help the distressed cow.  If Jesus thought that about a cow, how much more so can the 'rules' be broken to serve another human being in distress?  It is purely this dichotomy that distressed Sister Luke so much that he eventually had to leave the convent.  She was there to serve the needs of people, hurting people, not to follow endless rules to the letter.  She complained that the Convent expected that a sister counseling a lady who, for example, really needed comforting as she was dying, had to forsake the patient at the tone of the bell tolling silence.  Sister Luke couldn't reconcile the emotional affliction of that woman with the perceived benefits of silent meditation.The whole movie is full of conflicts like this.  At one point. Sister Luke, an outstanding science student was asked to fail an exam so as to not appear to be superior to another, less talented nun in the same course.  What the Mother Superior didn't seem to realize was that for Sister Luke to give a false, wrong answer on the final exam, would make her into a liar.  As one is watching this movie, they would do well to look for situations such as these and ask himself what God, through the lens of today's Catholic catechism, would expect her to do.  Protestants should ask themselves the same things through their doctrines.Knowing that everyone in religious life in this movie was sincerely trying to serve God in their best way possible, one can see the makings of great drama.  The big question addressed by 'The Nun's Story' is which way is the right way?  Or, maybe, different people need different ways of serving God, so both are right?  Perhaps, like Sister Luke, you'll want to pray about it.  Watch this classic movie, then decide for yourself! ",0
"One of my favorite albums is finally on CD, and to think it was made right here in Chicago on the long defunked Billingsgate lable! This album has some great dual guitar work on it.

It doesnt matter if you know the words, the music speaks for itself. It lifts you, it moves you, and this is quality all over.The soundpicture is clear, with great acoustic certainly on the guitar, and Gloria`s voice is even better here, then when she sings american language songs. The good thing with this cd, is that it`s so much room inbetween the instruments that lift`s forward Estefan`s voice to a higher level of ""earjoy""Track 7 Si Senor and Track 9 Montuno shows that Gloria Estefan really knows here roots when it comes to the rythmic upbeat songs too. I dont know much of the words, but the music speak for it self.  Like Track 12 Tradicion, im agree, and i think that the word is universal. This Cd keeps the ""tradicion"" when it comes too roots and the ""real thing",0
"If you've owned cockatiels for a long time, this book is not for you.  But if you're just beginning, like me, this book gives a great overview of all the things you need to consider when buying and taking care of a cockatiel.

Overall I'd say this  book deserves an A++",1
"Brommer's text is perfect for anyone interested in exploring collage as a fine art.  He gives some history, hence context, for the work of collage.  There are plenty of different techniques offered for exploration by the reader with lots of detail and materials lists.  These are not ""specific"" projects, but rather show a project using the methods described and leave open-ended your own creation.  The art of collage is also placed in current context when contemporary applications are examined in the end of the book.  I rate this for anyone interested in collage as an art form.  This is not a ""craft"" book, but rather almost an art course in collage in a book",1

"At last!  A book written for non-biologists, non-ecologists and non-tree-huggers!!  I have read several books on permaculture which always left me wondering, ""What the heck IS permaculture and who needs it?""  This book, by Toby Hemenway, will get you so excited about the relevance and applications of permaculture that you will want to race outside with a bucket of vegetable peelings and leaf mulch before breakfast.  Gardening can be a lot of hard work, but permaculture is about making it easier.  Turning over compost piles every week is not for you?  See his section on sheet composting.  Does the very word ""grey water"" turn you off?  Read Hemenway's description of taking a shower, then tearing outside in a towel to see the water drain out through a rocky stream.  This book is full of concepts and inspirations that will not only make gardening a little easier but will also improve the land you live on, help you achieve greater self-sufficiency and create sanctuary for beneficial critters.  And here is a major plus:  Toby Hemenway, unlike other permaculture authors, actually has a sense of humor! An enjoyable read on the one hand and a basic gardening manual for the rest of your life",1

Yet, it is one of those things one takes pleasure in when loaning.",0
"Scott Landis knows how to write.  This is both a history book and a woodworking book, and I still loved it.  I never liked history in HS or college, but if I had had Landis, I would have been a history major.  The book is captivating virtually from cover to cover (although I found the latter chapters a little less enthralling than the first 3/4 of the book).  I plan to build a significant workbench, and I bought this book thinking it would help me with ideas and planning.  It did so much more than that, I'm stunned.  The insights it gave me about different ways of working with wood have expanded beyond the previous limits of my imagination.  Landis' approach to describing the workbench from an historical perspective highlights the changes in tools that have occurred over the years and how benches have evolved alongside.  I started reading the book as a devoted user of power tools who would put up with some hand tools if absolutely necessary.  I ended with a much clearer understanding of how hand tools, working in conjunction with the appropriately designed and build bench, could enhance my woodworking pleasure and accomplishments.  lol, I've even started buying high quality planes.If you enjoy history, get this book.If you want to gain better insight into ways to work wood, get this book.I you are looking for bench plans, this has some, but I wouldn't buy it for the plans.  While there's nothing wrong with the plans, they just seem sort of out-of-place here.  I would rather have had more narrative.If you are looking for a tutorial on how to build a bench, this is not the book.If you just like looking at and reading about neat stuff made from wood, buy this book.Bottom line - if in doubt, buy this book",1

"This is an excellent book. The author takes what could be a dry as Karoo dust subject and makes it come alive. The basic premise is that much of the population in sub-Saharan Africa is poor while the countries are rich in resources. It doesn't need to be that way. Good government coupled with enlightened economic policies can change the region into an economic dynamo.One of the more entertaining and, at the same time, thought provoking chapters has to do with transporting a truck load of beer from the brewery in coastal Douala, Cameroon to a distribution depot 500 km to the east. A planned two day trip becomes four on the road. The troubles encountered, 47 police checkpoints among other things, illustrates the problems to be overcome.It is a generally up beat book that doesn't pull punches when they need to be thrown.Like too many books these days, more and better maps would be nice to supplement the text",1

"The two films in this set are definitely worth watching. The hilarious antics of Roland Young, Billie Burke and their supporting casts make these a must-have for Film Noir buffs and car fans alike!In Topper, Roland Young plays quiet bank president, Cosmo Topper, who alongside his wife, Clara (Burke), lead their quiet, highly scheduled life. On the other side of NYC, George and Marian Kerby (Cary Grant and Constance Bennet) live it up, every hour on the hour or until the manager kicks them out.After a boring board meeting, George puts his foot down once too often and send himself and Marian off the road and into Limbo. In a quest for the important Good Deed that they lack, they decide to help their friend Topper out of his rut, turning his life, and marriage, on its ear!While Young steals every scene from Grant, the uniqueness of this movie wouldn't be possible without the one uncredited star of the film, the Painted Jezebel, the Kerby's 1936 Buick Roadmaster roadster. This one-of-a-kind Bohman & Schwartz creation is the focal point for much of the film's important scenes: the wreck, Topper's rebellion against his wife and his discovery of the Kerbys, and the scene at the end. The car was one of the best examples of mid-'30s coachbuilding, and reflects the flash, style and vibrant youthfullness of the Kerbys perfectly.While the Buick gives way to a Mercedes in Topper Returns, the cast makes up for it in a slightly non-canon sequel to the first film. This time, Cosmo gets a visit from another lady ghost, who earlier got him in hot water with Mrs. Topper (again!). Her insistant request to find out who killed her leads him to the suitably frightening Carrington house just down the road. Along with his chauffeur, Eddie (played by Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson of Jack Benny fame), they explore the grounds to find out whodunit. Later, Mrs. Topper and the maid, Emily, end up looking for Cosmo in the midst of the murder investigation.While Mrs. Topper is unusually ditzy in this film, it adds to the nuttiness of the story greatly. Anderson lends his sharp wit and inimitable style to the cast, providing much of the comedy scenes, which compete with Joan Blondell and Billie Burke's characters. While vastly different in feel to the original, it's a good film nonetheless, with an exciting and amusing chase scene at the end, where Blondell's ghost ""drives"" Topper's Benz in pursuit of the villain",0
"I'm sorry - I absolutely loved ""Instance"" and was hoping for something of comparable caliber. Instead I found myself dreading the time I would waste slogging through it. Sort of the way I felt about Michael Chabon's ""The Final Solution"" when half-way through I realized that that's all there is and what a shame to waste the energy writing even a novella on so flimsy a framwork.Lewis Libby's ""The Apprentice"" is a better rendition of the ""slender little mystery elevated towards art"" genre which isn't really saying all that much.Spend your time reading ""An Instance of the Fingerpost"" twice.",1

"I feel deeply for those who have had their favorite books ripped to shreds by a movie (nothing on earth could tempt me to see the new Flicka movie)--but I haven't read this book.  I absolutely loved this movie with all of it's 70's songs.  The costumes, sets, and fx were cheesy and cheap--but I'll take them over the cold, computer-generated world of Shrek any day of the week.  This movie even made the Princess Bride seem a bit dreary--I'll take Ella over Buttercup any day of the week, too.  The cast pours their heart and soul into this and obviously had a blast making it.  I had a blast watching it--I laughed out loud a number of times and sang along with the tunes.  This is 96 minutes of pure escapist fare--buy it and enjoy.  It's definitely for kids, but sometimes that's a good things for adults",0

Having grown up listening to the Beatles, working in the music industry, and generally absorbing everything I could regarding their careers, both individually and collectively, much of what you see in print these days about The Beatles has all been said before.

"Anyone who is familiar with mid/ late 80's pop has got to remember Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam and the great jams they cranked out. All of the big ones are here. You get both of their fabulous #1 hits. &quot;Head To Toe&quot; starts out like a Supremes song and then takes off with a terrific catchy chorus *instantly recognizable.* &quot;Lost In Emotion&quot; was the other #1 and is just as great. Then you have the slow song &quot;All Cried Out&quot; which is beautiful and although Lisa Lisa comes off as sort of whiny, it justifies the song so it's forgivable. &quot;Youuuuuu you leave me so confuuuused, now I'm all cried out...over you.&quot; An 80's slow jam classic. Plus, you get the great free-style dance jams that put them on the map in the first place. Who can forget &quot;I Wonder If I Take You Home&quot; or one of my faves &quot;Can You Feel the Beat.&quot; A MUST buy for 80's music fans. I don't care what people say about the 80's. Free-style dance music like Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam is awesome and music just isn't made this fun anymore. If you like this, I also recommend music by Expose and Debbie Gibson. Ear candy to help you forget about your troubles",0
"This book is both a good introduction to quatum computing, and quantum mechanics in general.  The only knock against this book, is that the author sometimes gets confused as to who his audience is.  This book is on the one hand written in a 'popular' style (eg, ""Brief History of Time""), but is also very challenging and techincal.  I'd say the intended audience people have a strong background in computer science.  Without any technical background, you'll get lost very early on, as your eyes glaze over reading his descriptions of public-key cryptography, and diagrams of quantum algorithms (complete with reversible controlled-NOT gates).  A working knowledge of logic and discrete math will help a lot here.  Not a simple book to digest, but because it's written in the 'popular' style, it is immensely enjoyable and satisfying, *if* you're interested in the topic, and have the proper background to absorb it",1

Many of the speakers being interviewed were obviously serious about their areas of study, but most seemed unprepared. This may be because this seems to be a convention or conference, and perhaps they were unaware that they would be interviewed. One person being interviewed may have explained my problem with DVD best when he was asked what the best answers or theories concerning consciousness were today. He said that there are none...that we don't have a clue. I really don't get the impression that anyone interviewed on this DVD has a solid clue, and it is apparent in their interviews.      The most disappointing interview was the man who said he studied body types, he gave Santa Claus a body type and Twiggy a body type, and that he had met a woman at the conference who had a rare body type which he planned to explore more with her that evening. What does this have to do with consciousness?     Probably the best interview was the woman who was not a PHd., but a student( I believe). She again seemed to imply that there is no clue to ""consciousness"", but it would take a collaborative effort and open minds.     This DVD would be improved if it were in fact a collaborative  study. It should have included or made reference to the important history of the study, including psychology and philosophy.",0

"Entertaining, historically accurate except for the female wardrobe; the starlets complained that Roman womens' attire was unflattering to their bodies.  Tough tintinabulas, toots!  Rome was as sophisticated a society as any the world has yet produced, and some interesting parallels run through the series' storyline to the U.S. current state.    Those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.  Because western civilization borrows so much from Roman society, it would behoove us to heed their, and our, excesses, lest we become that which we admire: a time and people long gone",0

"I was expecting this book to be quality entertainment judging by the reviews from many readers on a popular horse-related web board.  I was sadly disappointed due to the stereotyped, poorly-developed characters and weakly-strung plot.  This book professes to be a humorous farce, and the first chapters had me enticed.  However, too many ridiculous scenes and caricatured main characters put me off.  Singer's best passages are those pertaining to the horse's personalities, as someone else mentioned.  Those scenes that capture the frustration, excitement, and mental game of competitive riding are worthwhile.  Overall, this book failed to keep my interest. ",1
"I bought this book with great hopes of getting some sleep for myself and my 13 week old.  We've had a bit of a rough time with her, with colic and reflux, and she refused to sleep anywhere except next to me or in my arms.  After 13 weeks of not sleeping more than 2 hours at a time, I was definitely not opposed to letting her ""cry it out.""  The book advises that you can expect your baby to cry 45 minutes the first night, 1 hour the second, 20 minutes the 3rd, with a gradual decrease.  Our baby cried 3 1/2 hours the first night before I finally gave up and picked her up, with no improvement the next 2 nights.  My problem with this book is the same as with many other sleep books, like Babywise.  The author assumes that all babies will respond similarly and offers no advice if it doesn't work, or if you have a ""high needs"" baby.  Oh, and don't bother trying to get in touch with Dr. Mindell if you have similar problems.  I posted a message for her on a board she hosts, but the only messages she responds to are the ones that have easy answers, or ones that go along with what her book says.  Don't waste your money.  To summarize the book, she just advises letting the baby cry it out, while going in to check on them every few minutes without picking them up.  And have a nighttime routine in place.  Brilliant.  We are still desperately tired at my house",1

". . . from Mike Patton and the great X-ecutioners.  Lots of commentary on the album that I won't go into here. (Suffice it to say, it's both entertaining and subtle while being not-so-subtle.)Patton sings his heart out on some tracks, in a very polished, poppy way we've not heard in a while, and the X-ecutioners are as impeccable as ever throughout.Pick it up, put it on and enjoy.

"If anyone cares, there are 3 additional scenes in this version.  The dude who is shot by the robot at the board meeting-there is a gruesome scene of him falling backwards on a table while being shot with blood spraying everywhere.  It's only a few seconds and doesn't add much, but it's a cool scene.  The next scene is only about 3 seconds long.  During the cop chase, there is a close up of Murphy shooting one of the robbers 2x in the leg.  The R version just shows a distant shot of him being hit once.  Murpheys death is a bit longer also.  You see blood pour out of his lost hand, watch his entire left arm get shot off (not just the hand), and he gets shot at a bit longer.  You do feel worse for Murphy after watching this version-especially the scene where blood is pouring from his hand stump.  Overall, maybe 20 seconds of cut material.  I wouldn't spend extra to see it, but if you get the choice, this is the version to get.  ",0
"Much has already been said by other reviewers as to the background of this recording.  I'd like to simply say that it was much more to my liking than the previous CD  from 1999 ""A Musical Banquet"".  On this line-up of selections Andreas has chosen very well for his vocal abilities which are considerable.  As long as he stays away from Lute Songs and the like (especially if they are in English) I'm more than pleased with his voice.  This is a very enjoyable disc including many less familiar composers such as Gasparini, Marcello and Pasquini.  But then it includes the familiar like Corelli and Scarlatti.Although Scholl tends to the less dramatic renditions it didn't bother me as it would if he were singing Handel.  The one Scholl album I would put above this one is his ""German Baroque Songs""",0

"This book starts with a description of objects and OMT and UML stuff. It explains the benefits of object oriented techniques and of the capabilities of simulation. It takes some pages to explain how simulation languages work  and what needs to be included. So far no problem. Untill it starts  explaining about a barber shop and PSIM (the simulation language developed  in C++ by the author of the book). All kinds of process flows are modelled,  not only in the basics of the library elements of the language, but also in  the example itself. Unfortunately the whole object oriented technique is  neglected. For the object oriented expert a good laughter, for the novice  in either OO or simulation, watch out for this book and duck.

"This book explores a wide range of mathematical concepts, including many of the traditional ""fun"" topics like Fibonacci numbers.  For each topic (covered on two large pages typically) there is a simple story written to be accessible to even young children, followed by a franker and more mature mathematical discussion.  This two part approach makes the text accessible to a wide audience while having a solid mathematical foundation.  The articles serve as a solid foundation to spark student interest in further exploration, or stand alone as interesting mathematical shorts.  Some of the topics will have direct curricular applications, including articles on the real number system and the transcendental number pi.  This is a wonderful text and is suitable for elementary through high school students",1

He gives special attention to Nazi efforts to purge the arts of Jews and other so-called undesirables.",1
"By far the most uncomfortable and penetrating message I have come across through the printed medium, this book will - hopefully - cut through the ingrained detritus of philosophy and 'psychology of the self' which has built up in the human psyche over countless aeons. To read this with hope of aquiring some esoteric knowledge of oneself or the world is to miss the point. If it's engaged with directly, personally, then Krishnamurti's message - digested by the very core of your being - may just be the extraordinarily deep and powerful catalyst it was for me. To really listen to what is being discussed here, instead of approaching as another philosophical text to be analysed and processed by the habitual and distorted logic of ego, is to open up to the possibility that things just might never be the same again. Suffice to say that on many occasions I had to put the book in a dark cupboard, make myself a strong cup of tea and have a lie down. What a lovely man",1
"I was actually surprised to see this on the bookshelf!  The only exposure to Spring MVC documentation I've had was either on www.springframework.org or the book written by the spring authors themselves which doesn't necessarily have much appeal.This book is extremely well-written and the first three chapters provide a very good overview of Spring and some really good advice on developing a layered application in general.  There's tons of information with clear examples.  I admit, I'm only just more than halfway through the book, however, what I've seen so far is well worth the price.I'm definitely going to be designing my web applications using this framework going forward.

(I started reading these books when I was 12 and am now 19) With this book you find out so many new things about the 4 of them. You really get to know their personalities more and who they are as adults. You now see them grow from children to young adults and all they have seen in their short life. It is amusing how they can show up the most experienced mages in the world. All because they work together, so this also is a good lesson for children, even though this book has more adult content in it than the other ones. But if you have read the other 8 books in the series you will love this book. The only frusterating part is how they won't let the other ones in their lives in the begining but of course everything works out. All in all read this book, you will love it!

"If you're looking for balanced, cool-headed, well-argued case against Social Security reform, this is not your book. If you want a partisan diatribe that is about as worthwhile as the anti-Social Security &quot;propaganda&quot; that Mr. Skidmore describes, then you've found your  tome. (Curiously, in the author's narrative &quot;propaganda&quot; suddenly  becomes skillful or ingenious &quot;rhetoric&quot; when its used in support  of Social Security; never mind that the program has functioned like a  multi-billion dollar campaign fund for the Democrats). This book is  essentially an elaborate ad hominem attack against anybody who would dare  question the sustainability of current entitlement spending on the elderly.  The author attributes all reform proposals to the right-wing; never mind  that several respectable individuals whom no one would call reactionary,  including Brookings economist Henry Aaron, former CBO director Robert  Reischauer, former SSA chief actuary Robert Myers, and Urban Institute  senior fellow Eugene Steuerle have also suggested reasonable,  non-privatization proposals to slow the rate of entitlement spending.  Skidmore's arguments against any reform are poorly constructed and rely on  a very narrow range of evidence and expertise. He offers straw man  refutations such as a cranky letter from an Auburn professor in USA Today,  of all places, that is hardly representative of mainstream thought. There  are truly bizarre counterarguments: he suggests that projections of  increasing life expectancy must be bunk because the human race is not  immortal. There are downright falsehoods: he claims that the  &quot;relevant&quot; number concerning welfare state spending is the total  dependent population--ignoring the fact that the average elderly dependent  costs far more money than the average child dependent, and that money spent  on the latter is an investment in a future worker while supporting the  former only contributes to consumption. The author is also either  completely ignorant or disingenuous when he discusses the program's  financing. Like many of those who claim a &quot;crisis&quot; in the system,  Skidmore misleadingly focuses on the program's long-term &quot;trust  fund&quot; balance. Even if the economy will do far better than is  projected, as he argues, Social Security will eventually not be able to  support itself on payroll taxes alone and it will have to redeem its  &quot;assets&quot;--translated, this means that general taxpayer revenue  will be necessary to subsidize benefits, increasing what current workers  are paying into the system. He is correct to state that the increase in  Social Security spending will be only 1-2% of GDP, but Medicare will add  much more to that and the real concern is entitlement spending as a  percentage of the federal budget. There is legitimate concern that general  revenue transfers to entitlements plus interest expenses will crowd out  funds for everything else--from education to infrastructure to defense to  programs for the non-elderly poor. Skidmore makes the downright silly  argument that we should just hike up the interest rates on the bonds that  Social Security holds--where the hell does he think this money is coming  from? As the late Herb Stein mused, we could simply &quot;credit&quot;  Social Security with the money to pay benefits for the next trillion years  if we wanted to, but this would simply be an accounting gimmick. Yet this  is what Skidmore endorses when he enthuses over Clinton's &quot;plan&quot;  to &quot;save&quot; Social Security by shifting debt even further down the  timeline. Predictably, Skidmore says that if trouble should arise, we  should simply raise taxes (in his eyes, raising the retirement age is a  dastardly benefit cut). In his glorified history of the program, Skidmore  doesn't bother to mention how Democratic Congresses routinely ignored  scheduled payroll tax increases and instead continued to hike up  benefits--thereby increasing the level of payments that are considered  necessary. Research, such as that done by Daniel Radner (1993) and Michael  Hurd (1989) show that the elderly are at least as well off as the rest of  the population, even though the elderly poor generally have no means to  escape their poverty. Yet Skidmore dismisses the idea of targeting relief  to this group, instead relying on the liberal shibboleth that attributes  Social Security's political success to its &quot;incorporation&quot; of the  middle class, which is really just a roundabout way of saying that people  tend to like the government when the government sends them checks. (He also  conveniently fails to discuss that the program's political support revolves  around a few carefully promoted fictions--see the Rothstein article in  reference below). Social Security and Medicare have been successful in  helping lots of people, there's no doubt about that. But we should not  ignore the fact that the program was created in different time for a  different world, and has grown into something far larger than what was  originally contemplated. Longer life spans, less working years, greater  health--these are all things to be happy about, but they also signify a new  reality that books like this one will not help us to understand. Far better  books on the subject include Aaron &amp; Reischauer's Countdown to Reform,  or Steuerle's Retooling Social Security for the 21st Century. Even if  you're skeptical of privatization, as I am, see the work of Martin  Feldstein or William Beach of the Heritage Foundation (Beach's plan DOES  account for disability, and he has answered critics of his methodology). I  found this book repeatedly frustrating, even maddening at times, for the  author's intransigence and even dishonesty on several issues--a for more  earnest discussion of the liberal standpoint is Richard Rothstein's  &quot;When We Practice to Deceive&quot; in Dissent (Fall 99). In sum, this book is alternately dim-witted,  disingenuous, omissive, and petty. It's hard to believe that a supposedly  reputable academic could put out such an unillimunating piece of tripe like  this. This is one of the worst books on public policy that I have ever  read",1

"...I loved this graphic novel, and so many accolades have been heaped upon this book that I need'nt say more. However, in reviewing some of the readers responses, and colligiate papers regarding the works of Maus, many seemed surprised or shocked that such amazing storytelling could be attributed to the comic book form. Why? I have been a lover and reader of comics for many years and this so - called ""low"" art form has produced some of the most memorable, touching, exciting, and thought-provoking material I have ever read. Granted, a large percentage of ""comic"" books cater to the stylized ""men-in-tights"" brigade, however even this attitude has changed much within the industry and modern comics. Even the long-running ""hero"" titles touch upon modern issues with a compexity that some people might find surprising. It should also be noted however that largely indie, underground, and other ""non-mainstream"" works really drive the graphic novel and comic industry in terms of content. If you thought comics simply ""silly childrens stories"" or ""lame escapism"" you should read some of the highly recommended titles of the genre and see why ""comics"" are being used as source material for a lot of current and upcoming films.",1

Why not just toss her in as is?"" The response of Michael Schiavo's supporter: ""why not indeed?""This is why this book is so important.

Her voice is melancholic, rich in subcontext, full of experience. In this particular album, recorded in 1986, she collaborated with some of the best musicians in the easy listening/jazz field, like George Benson, Herbie Hankock, Steve Gadd, Gil Evans, Michael Brecker, Ron Carter, in order to record the old standards that her generation created, like Il mondo,poesia,ancora,aria,canzone per te, e penso a te,la voce del silenzio etc. She created an atmosphere of deep,bittersweet melancholy, and all that you want to do is switch off the lights, take a big glass of drink and listen.",0

"I am so disappointed. I started Jordan's series years and years ago and gobbled up his huge books in record time, eagerly awaiting each new installment. Now it is apparent he is merely dragging the story out for financial reasons, and it is a shame because this series will be his legacy. It has brought him fame and fortune, and if he allows it to drown in unnecessary verbiage future generations will not even begin reading it; they'll be forewarned and forearmed. I scored it one star because you can't score a book any lower on this system.",1

"I came to know Mark Lane very intimately over a period of ten years - where we shared, exchanged, many long hours of intense discussion on the JFK and MLK assassinations.He captivated me with intricate details of the various events and supportive data sources. Through him - I relived these very complexed parts of American History as he awakened me to a darker deeper side of political shennanigans - not too unlike those which continued to take place in my own country.This very calm ... quiet man - often barely audible is one of the five most thought provoking people in my personal life. Yes, Mark  Lane makes you think  - without bludgeoning one over the head with senseless rhetoric or inflamatory diatribes.I recall how Oliver Stone borrowed Plausible Denial in preparation for his movie of the JFK Assassination - only to return it many months later (having discarded it as unhelpful) and yet using direct quotes from the book in the actual movie.This seems to be the way of naysayers ... their modus operandi - to negate those with whom they disagree by plagarising them.Is this then not the highest form of flattery?I highly recommend anyone with an independent mind to read Plausible Denial - for it will open your mind to a lot more critical thinking - by questioning rushed decisions by those in power - whether politically, the private sector or public life",1

The ability to rinse it out with water to clean it is a nice feature not to mention I think it is light weight and easy to hold.

"Under Cover, or Out of Control? The New York Times November 29, 1987, Sunday, Late City Final Edition (Review of 2 books, including The perfect failure: Kennedy, Eisenhower, and the CIA at the Bay of Pigs, only this book review included here)The torrent of revelations about the Iran-contra affair during the summer's televised hearings, and in the recently released report of the Congressional committees that conducted the hearings, has made Americans aware both of the importance of covert action in the foreign policy of their country and of its risks and costs. These two books do nothing to rehabilitate its reputation or to improve its image...Both men show how much euphoria about covert action was created by two early successes of the C.I.A.: in Iran in 1953, when Kermit Roosevelt, with the help of what Mr. Treverton calls a ''strange assemblage'' - a pro-Shah mob controlled by one Iranian leader, ''complete with giant . . . weight-lifters recruited from Teheran athletic clubs'' - overthrew Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh's Government and consolidated the Shah's shaky power; and in Guatemala in 1954, when the regime of Jacobo Arbenz Guzman was toppled by a small group of rebel soldiers moving in from Honduras. The action in Guatemala led officials to believe that such successes could be repeated elsewhere; it ''consolidated the ascendancy of covert action over espionage, and of operations over intelligence in the CIA,'' in Mr. Treverton's words - and it led directly to the Bay of Pigs and to the later operations in Chile that toppled that country's Government. Most of the men who planned these later activities had been involved in the Guatemalan affair.''Covert Action'' is valuable not only for its brief, sharp accounts of covert enterprises (the one in Chile was undertaken even though none of the official assessments had concluded that the election of Salvador Allende Gossens in 1970 threatened any vital United States interest), but above all for the lessons Mr. Treverton draws from history, and for his own assessments. The lessons are stark. As the targets of United States action became more formidable (Fidel Castro learned from Arbenz's fate), the chances of success decreased. Success requires bigger operations - and big operations can't remain secret (as the Reagan arms sales to Iran demonstrated).If the covert activities go on for a long time, as they have in Angola and, since 1981, in Nicaragua, the purposes tend to expand, along with the commitment and public knowledge. When the operations entail the manipulation of foreign elements with their own agenda (the Cuban exiles mobilized for the Bay of Pigs landing, or the Nicaraguan contras, or the anti-Allende factions in the Chilean military), American ability to control them is often limited. In any case, the fine-tuning of covert actions is difficult. In Chile, the United States Government tried to maintain a barrier ''between supporting opposition forces and funding groups trying to promote a military coup,'' but local realities made this ''a distinction built of sand.'' As a result, whatever restrictions and distinctions the United States may have tried to observe, in Chile and elsewhere, it ended up, in the eyes of foreign observers, being seen as responsible for the fall of Allende, or for the acts and fate of the Shah, or as colluding with South Africa against the Marxist regime in Angola.Mr. Treverton deals at length with the problems of control over covert action. He shows that the enthusiasm shown for it by several Administrations resulted not merely from the ''operational behavior'' of the C.I.A. - its bias for action over mere espionage - but also, frequently, from Presidential pressures (especially from Presidents Nixon and Reagan). But the need to keep operations secret - and the need to protect Presidents by maintaining the possibility of so-called plausible denial - meant that the activities would be discussed only by a small number of people, that insufficient debate and criticism would lead to grievous errors (such as the mistaken belief that the Cuban people would support the invading exiles rather than Mr. Castro) and that only a small proportion of covert-action projects would be reviewed by the National Security Council system.As for Congress, which went through a long period of complacency and complicity, it tried to reverse course after the Watergate crisis. The Hughes-Ryan Act of 1974 put an end to plausible denial by requiring a Presidential finding that each operation is important to national security, and the Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980 required that Congress be notified of all covert operations. But both laws are full of enough vague terms and escape hatches to allow the executive branch to thwart their authors' intentions, as the Iran-contra affair has shown. Indeed, the members of Congress are in a dilemma, highlighted by Mr. Treverton: when they are informed, they are in no position to stop the action - unless they leak its existence and thereby foreclose ''the option of covertness.''Thus, covert action raises formidable issues in an open society. Mr. Treverton lists the realists' arguments on behalf of secret operations - especially the need to meet, if not to match, Soviet covert activities and to help one's friends in a harsh and dangerous world. But his own position is closer to that of the idealists. He recognizes that covert operations may be necessary at times. But he doubts they'll remain secret, warns about their unintended effects and long-term costs and argues against having them run from the White House or in contradiction of official policy (as in the case of Irangate). He also shows that much that is done covertly by the C.I.A. could be done overtly by private organizations (he notes the foundations established by West German political parties that have aided democratic forces in such countries as Portugal), and, above all, he concludes that most covert-action successes have been small, ambiguous and transitory (Iran and Guatemala in the 1950's, for example).''Covert Action'' is enlightening, thoughtful and wise.Mr. Treverton, who writes elegantly, paints an often dirty scene in pastel colors. ---1987 Foreign Affairs1987 / 1988, WinterRECENT BOOKS ON INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: The United States; Pg. 438This is a succinct, authoritative history and critique of the government's use of covert action to shape or overthrow foreign regimes. Mr. Treverton's interest in the subject began in 1975 when he served on the staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (the Church Committee). His conclusion, based on deep knowledge of major actions (Iran, Guatemala, Cuba, Chile, Angola and others), is that covert action cannot be kept secret, usually has consequences far different from and less desirable than those intended, often ties the U.S. to clients who are not easily controlled, undermines the comparative advantage which the United States has as an open society, and is almost always a bad idea.---Los Angeles Times, October 18, 1987THE SEARCH FOR A 'MAGIC BUTTON' IN AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY;I first encountered CIA covert action operations in the early 1960s in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where I was serving my initial tour of duty as an American Foreign Service officer. A powerful anti-communist documentary film called ""We Will Bury You"" had been released commercially in several local theaters. On the second day of screenings, a teen-age boy who was bicycling reels from theater to theater was stopped by a gang of communist toughs. The can of film was stolen and the boy was shot in the head. A public uproar ensued. The U.S. Consulate quickly arranged for the boy to be flown to the U.S. Army hospital in the Panama Canal Zone, where mercifully he recovered.Years later, when I headed an investigative task force for the Senate Intelligence Committee, I learned the true story of that incident. The ""communist toughs"" were CIA ""assets"" hired to create an incident to promote the film. But when the boy resisted and tried to get away with the film, they panicked and shot him.Gregory F. Treverton's book, ""Covert Action: The Limits of Intervention in the Postwar World,"" is full of stories of CIA schemes gone wrong. In one surprising revelation, he describes how CIA Director William Casey, angry at his experts on terrorism for coming up with little evidence linking the Soviet Union to terror groups, ordered them to read Claire Sterling's famous book ""The Terror Network."" They did and found that virtually all of the examples she cited turned out to be CIA disinformation -- false stories planted in the foreign press that she unwittingly used in good faith.But the book also examines operations that, in the view of many, went right -- like overthrowing Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala and Mossadeq in Iran in the 1950s. Treverton has little patience with arguments that the coup that ousted Mossadeq and restored the Shah to power lies at the core of our present conflict with Iran. He points out that the Shah was identified with the United States in many ways besides that one -- most prominently, wasteful arms purchases from the United States -- and that the CIA covert action that secured his throne brought about a quarter century of stability, no small feat in the turbulent Middle East.Those initial successes set the pattern for other covert actions, some of which were disasters like the Bay of Pigs. This story has been told elsewhere, but Treverton treats us to new insights. Particularly shocking is his explanation that the invasion was considered foolproof because the exile brigade originally planned to land at the town of Trinidad, where, if something went wrong, they could melt into the mountains.But, at the last minute, Secretary of State Dean Rusk objected, prefering a ""quieter site"" for the landing. The Bay of Pigs was finally chosen, the planners apparently overlooking the fact that the mountains would then be 80 miles away across a swamp!Treverton, a lecturer at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, draws important lessons both for the public and for officials responsible for covert operations. He shows how the momentum of covert-action projects often carries them far beyond their original scope, citing not only the Bay of Pigs but efforts against Salvador Allende in Chile, which ultimately ended in the coup in which he was killed, and the Reagan Administration's undiminished stake in the contras. Treverton explains why covert actions are inherently difficult to control and often produce unintended results -- such as U.S. support for the Jonas Savimbi forces in Angola, putting us on the same side as South Africa and thus damaging our reputation throughout black Africa.Though often critical of the CIA, the author makes clear that one reason Presidents turn to covert action is that the Agency is extremely competent and gets the job done. He points out that Presidents are not tools of the CIA; rather the White House is often the source of pressure to come up with covert operations and even originates some of the more ill-considered ideas, such as the Iran-contra caper.I recall during my days as a Senate investigator finding a piece of yellow note pad with jottings from a meeting with White House officials during the Kennedy Administration that discussed an ""Executive Action"" or, in plain English, an assass-- capability. The notes referred to it as the ""magic button.""This unfortunately is all too often the mind set of senior government leaders when they consider the ""covert option""; namely, that somehow magically it will sweep away threats or obstacles to the success of U.S. policy. As Treverton points out, we have failed as often as we have succeeded, and even then our successes frequently cause us to forget about the underlying causes of the problems we face. For example, after Arbenz was deposed in Guatemala, we ignored Central America until the Sandinistas reminded us of the revolutionary potential of injustice in that region.Treverton notes that the world's revolutionaries have also learned a thing or two about covert action. As in Nicaragua they have discovered how to use CIA pressure to rally their publics against U.S. intervention. Fledgling left-wing regimes turn more quickly to Moscow for protection. The contrast with the past is striking: Arbenz was overthrown with 300 men; at the Bay of Pigs we hoped to overthrow Castro with 750 exiles and a tiny air force; but now, the CIA is supporting an army of 10,000 contras and still nobody thinks they have a prayer of displacing the Sandinistas.The striking change from the 1950s is that virtually all major covert actions now become public, often before they are concluded. Increasingly, the U.S. government doesn't care. American support for the Afghan resistance is not a secret, only unacknowledged. Still, bad decisions like trading arms for hostages are made without full appreciation of what will happen when, inevitably, the story leaks out.The most important contribution of Treverton's brilliant analysis is to demythicize covert action. It is not a romantic ""magic button"" that does away with the need for sound military and diplomatic strategies. It does not allow us to ignore economic and social realities in the turbulent underdeveloped world. But neither are such CIA operations the cause of all our troubles or inherently evil, as many critics might suggest.I firmly believe that covert action has a legitimate role in U.S. national security, but as Treverton makes clear, such operations are only as sound as the policy they seek to advance. The risks are always substantial and success is often fleeting.Ultimately, I became chairman of the National Security Council subcommittee that was responsible for intelligence operations during the Carter Administration. I only wish I had been able to read Treverton's fascinating and compelling book before doing so. For all those who may in the future have a role in such clandestine intelligence operations, including the watchdogs in Congress, ""Covert Action"" is required reading",1

"This issue with Dorgan's use of statistics was highlighted in a major newspaper this week and I feel compelled to share it with those who may not question the information the author uses to reach his conclusions.The book's author, in complaining about America's export situation, complains ""That's right. America's largest export (by volume) is now ""wastepaper"" mostly headed for China.""The hopefully obvious problem with this statement is that quantifying exports by volume is absurd in a day when economies rely far more significantly on the production of services and high-value products such as computer chips.  A cubic yard of Dell laptops clearly has far more value than a cubic yard of wastepaper.  The newspaper author went on to cite US trade statistics showing that, on a dollar basis, wastepaper is a comparatively insignificant (though undeniably bulky) export.Relying on information as flimsy as this, one would be forced to conclude that the author is really stretching to find statistics to support his protectionist agenda.  Overall the book needs to be read with a very critical eye, and perhaps added to the next ship carrying the US's largest (by volume) export to China",1

This book was such a dissapointment. Especially after reading Eric Blehm's Last Season. The writing was at best fair. I found myself either falling to sleep or skipping pages to see if something was eventually going to get better. I kept trying to figure out what the title had to do with the content. Fisher certainly knows A LOT about the building of dams or the flooding history of a particular area and on and on and on. Ocasionally there was a sentence or two that made me feel it was about to turn around but I realized that at more than 3/4 of the way through I was still hoping for that. This confirms my long time belief that good reviews mean nothing. I would strongly suggest saving your money. I wish I could get mine back,1
"This book contains short biographies of pirates.  It was first published in 1724, but these stories read fast despite the antiquated language.  The biographies focus on the most interesting parts of each pirate's life instead of dry facts.  There are plenty of more ""serious"" facts here, but the biography goes into more detail just when the reader is getting curious.  So we are told any interesting anecdotes about each pirate in the course of reading their biographies.For example the biography of Anne Bonny tells about her life and exploits as a pirate.  But we also are treated to a description of the bedroom farce by which Anne's mother, a household servant, was discovered by the lady of the house to be having an affair with the man of the house.  She caught the maid accidentally because of a prank involving spoons hidden in the bed sheets.  This event doesn't take place during Anne's life.  (It involves her conception, and leads into why her father left for the New World.)  But really we are told about it because it is a good entertaining story.So this book is highly readable and entertaining despite the language.  This is a good book for you if you are into pirates, history, or the adventure genre (this book is factual, but it inspired many fictions)",1

"DIANE ARBUS: REVELATIONS is one of the most beautiful monographs of an artist I have ever seen or read.  This over-sized, beautifully bound, highest quality paper, extraordinarily fine reproductions of photogravure, and sensitively designed and written catalogue for the touring museum exhibition of Diane Arbus Photographs is simply magnificent and well worth the rather steep price.  But a state-of-the-art monograph would be of little consequence were it not about one of the most controversial and phenomenally gifted photographers of the last century.  Arbus had an affinity for capturing people she encountered because they produced a source of wonder in her.  Her eyes were attracted to the edges of normal appearance and anatomy where she captured luminously tender photographs of developmentally challenged fellow human beings.  There are countless images of children and adults who have survived a life of 'non-normalcy' and she framed them in her camera's eye with no sense of the voyeur, but instead with a great sense of humanism.  Here are portraits of giants with their parents, patients from mental institutions, carnival folk, transvestites, anatomic wonders, as well as simple twins, people she found fascinating, populated places that struck her imagination.  The photogrpahs of Diane Arbus have become icons and the contributors to this volume help to propel her already praiseworthy status to that of a genius: Sandra Phillips' essay 'The Question of Belief', photographer Neil Selkirk's intimate 'In the Darkroom' (Selkirk is the only person allowed to develop prints of Arbus' output), and the beautifully conceptualized and constructed Chronology by Doon Arbus and Elisabeth Sussman bringing to us rarely seen portions of Arbus' output and thoughts - all of these are rendered in the best of taste and finest of scholarship.  Finally, here is a volume that fleshes out the magnificence of the art of Diane Arbus.  This bibliophile's dream of a book deserves awards and most important, deserves your attention.  Highly recommended as a true collector's item",1

"I am intrigued by books about the plague.  The attraction?  Well, even one of my crappiest, exhaustion-filled day pales in comparison to living through the plague.  Or maybe it's those gore filled plague sores that call to me (but I'd never truly admit that).This book is a bit different than the few that I've read about the plague of the 1600's in that it isn't scholarly, dry or written from the point of view of adults.  This fictional tale is told by a young lady named Mal who describes her world with beauty and sensitivity.  Initially, the writing style was a bit of a chore and a little difficult to get into.  But stick with it, the journey is well worth the work.  Once I adjusted myself to the rhythm of the writer and the different language choices (than I'm used to) I fell completely into Mall's world of hard work and young love amidst the threat of unbelievable horror when the Bubonic Plague arrives.I'm a hard-hearted reader, having read far more than my share of overly sentimental stuff, but this book brought me to tears too many times to count from the sheer strength of this young girl.  It makes me all teary just to think about these people.   This is a book that should be required reading in schools (if it isn't already).   ",1
"No words are needed to review this book. Simply put: Every American should have a copy at Home. Based in the original pen and ink edition from Random House in 1987, this edition has been painted and illustrated entirely by Sam Fink, creating a beautifully crafted full color masterpiece.This is the one book that we must read again and again to gain an intimate and complete knowledge of it. A book for the entire family and one that we must never forget",1
"Incubus'new album...ACLOTM is quite a trip to say the least. It goes in every musical direction Incubus has touched while still throwing in a ton of new styles. At first i wasn't too impressed, i liked it and all but it really didn't touch me. Until recently and now i can't stop listening to it. I've owned this for well over a year now, and it really hadn't touched me until about a month ago. The way the tracks flow just blows my mind still after all these listens.1.Megalomaniac 8/10...Would be much higher if i and everyone else for that matter hadn't heard so many times. Still a great song that rocks hard and i love how in your face it is at times.2.A Crow Lef Of The Murder 9.5/10...Just an amazing song. The guitar is awesome and it features a great chorus.3.Agoraphobia 9.5/10...Stunning. Some of Brandon's best vocal delivery, and i just love the way it's pieced together, a softer song that is amazing.4.Talk Show On Mute 9/10...A hit, but not overplayed. I used to not like this song very much, but now it's one of my favorites. More melodic vocals and another softer song with many cool effects.5.Beware! Criminal 9/10...The rock kicks back in. Reminds me a bit of a heavier version of tracks 2 or 3. I love this song and the verses are great.6.Sick Sad Little World 9.5/10...*Gasp* Wow. Tremendously written and probably in their top 10 most well written songs. Just A Phase was the last album's epic and this one owns that trait.7.Pistola 8.5/10...A fun rocker, and i used to love it, but now it seems it's kind of weak compared to that last track. Although a great song on it's own, it's tough to follow Sick Sad Little World.8.Southern Girl 9/10...A stunning beautiful soft song. The lyrics are touching and just a great overall song.9.Priceless 8/10...A very good song, except the chorus gets a little annoying. The break down in the middle is one of my favorite parts on the whole cd.10.Zee Deveel 8.5/10...Another unusual song. At least in the beginning, the chorus is great and it's very cool song.11.Made For TV Movie 10/10...I have recently decided that this is my favorite song on the cd. The verses are pretty dark and quiet like alot of the songs with a great chorus and it ends tremendously.12.Smile Lines 9/10...Another weird start, kind of reminds me of the song Misty Mountain Hop by Led Zeppelin, but the tempo immediately changes and it's amazing.13.Here In My Room 9.5/10...Stunning. The piano and the lush vocals make this one of Incubus' most heart-felt songs.14.Leech 9/10...A heavier way to end this amazing cd. The first verses are ok..but then the bridge is really cool and it ends great.Just get this, probably after you get S.C.I.E.N.C.E., Make Yourself, and Morning View, but you need this. You'll love it",0
"This team from CertTest Training really hit the bull's eye for the much needed comprehensive study guide for information systems auditors. This guide is very unique because it bridges the gap for two of our primary groups of entrants to the information systems auditing arena. For a traditional auditor, this book translates the risk/control disciplines, traditional to audits, to the information technology environment. A typical auditor can identify with the controls without being an average IT savvy person. For the nuts-and-bolts techie, the guide helps reengineer your thinking process to control awareness and identification.The guide has eight chapters. Chapters 2 through 8 cover the syllabus for the CISA exam. Below is a brief overview of my evaluation of each chapter.Chapter 1: Secrets of a Successful AuditorThis chapter is a must read for all existing or wanna-be systems auditors. It provides an overview of the IS audit standards in simple terms for almost any audience, gives an overview of professional requirements, skill sets, the auditing environment and some project management. The tone is this chapter is very motivating and encouraging. For IS auditors like us, it tells our life story, for a wanna-be, this is a recruitment effort. This chapter characterizes the authors' combined years of experience. It is a good appetizer.Chapter 2: Audit ProcessArmed with the knowledge of the secrets of a successful auditor in chapter 1, I was ready to delve into the main course. Chapter 2 welcomes you with a flow diagram of the audit process and provides step by step explanation of risk-based audits and how to plan and conduct audits using applicable standards, guidelines and best practices. The authors provide precise definitions of terminology. Auditor independence could not have been over-emphasized in this chapter. For the exam candidate, most questions on independence are based on judgement. This chapter ensures the reader can grasp the concept and can apply it to exam questions and of course to real life situations.Chapter 3: IT GovernanceWith respect to the IT Governance area, which has been characterized with ambiguity since it's inception, the authors tried to explain the overall concept successfully. The only glitch is that, with CISA being an internationally acclaimed qualification, I had expected more governance examples such as the ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) to be included for the readers from Europe and other corners of the world relate to somehow. However, I enjoyed the illustrations on the performance measurement section, the scoring and the Capability Maturity Modeling. The authors' explanation for Business Process Engineering and Business Impact Analysis (my favorite area) was excellent. For the purpose of the exam, I believe this section was adequately written.Chapter 4: Networking TechnologyFor the techie, the first few pages may either be boring or a good refresher. However, for the rest of the chapter, the authors' made a conscientious effort to bridge functionality with audit/security controls for the techie candidate. For the traditional auditor, the first few pages of this chapter provide a good foundation on information technology concepts, mush like an IT 101 course would; that is assuming you have some exposure to IT terminology and understand the difference between a ""bite"" from a hamburger and bytes in the computer. David's group even throws in some excellent mnemonics you can use for the exam. This section will not make you a professional hacker but will assist you in passing the exam.Chapter 5: System and Infrastructure Life Cycle ManagementI was impressed by the authors' experience in performing SDLC type reviews as portrayed in Chapter 5. Not only were the methodologies adequately explained, but the real life examples and tips provided brought life to this subject area. This is good exam material as well as good reference material.Chapter 6: IT Service Delivery and SupportThis was also an excellent section. This section is a good resource for understanding and reviewing IT operations and management. Excellent illustrations and explanations for scorecards, SLA, metrics and problem management.Chapter 7: Protection of Information AssetsThe beginning of this chapter seems more of a CISM study guide, however it lays the ground work for the CISA candidate to appreciate the thin, often fuzzy, demarcation of network security audits by CISA's and other security professionals. This is very relevant as a result of the plethora of new regulations pertaining to privacy, such as HIPAA and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that has passed in the USA and other laws passed in Europe and other parts of the world. This section is very rich in information and of definate benefit to the CISA candidate.Chapter 8: Business Continuity and Disaster RecoveryIn light of recent natural and contrived disasters (terrorist strikes, cyberwarfare and floods) around the nation and the rest of the world; the topics in this chapter have been gaining importance by the day. To be able to put this hot issue in only 30 pages without compromising on content and coverage, the authors had to perform a miracle. The authors did justice to this area and any IT audit professional can utilize the information within both as exam and/or reference material. Here again IT auditors are being called upon to review disaster recovery and business continuity initiatives to ensure corporate survival.After reviewing the book, I was ready to take the exam, but I realized I had already passed the exam ages ago. But this book was surely an excellent refresher and I vow to keep it in my arsenal of references.Sam Arthur, CPA, CISA, CISM, CISSP is a Director of Information Technology Assurance & Control with Thompson Cobb Bazilio and Associates, a national certified public accounting and consulting firm headquartered in Washington DC. Sam was formerly the Co-chair of Education and Research for the ISACA National Chapter and is now the Coordinator for the Chapter Coordinator CISM.

"""These exercises will give you new information about yourself. You will be able to make new choices. If you are willing, then you can definitely create the kind of life you say you want."" ~Louse L. HayLouise delves into health, fears, phobias, sex, self-esteem, money, friendship, addictions, work and intimacy issues. In her loving, caring way, she guides you through fifteen work""fun"" chapters. I think this book is more fun than work. You will learn about: 1. Basic Techniques - Changing thoughts and releasing old beliefs about yourself. 2. Who Are You? What Do You Believe? 3. Health Checklist4. Feeling Good5. Fears and Phobias6. Anger7. Criticism and Judgment8. Addictions9. Forgiveness10. Work11. Money and Prosperity12. Friends13. Sexuality14. Love and Intimacy15. Your New PictureYou will find questions like: ""What do you want that you are not having?"" At the end of the first chapter there is a ""Deservability Treatment"" where you can read affirmations and perhaps extract one or two sentences for daily reflection like: ""I am willing to create new thoughts about myself and about my life. My new thinking becomes new experiences."" There are many places where you can record your own thoughts about various topics like love, sex, work, money, success, failure and God. There is a place to write a story of your life and to draw a picture of your inner child. The chapter on health might jumpstart a new healthy journey into nutrition and wellness. If you want to pass this book along to a friend, you could also buy a small journal and make notes in the journal instead of on the pages. This book could also be used as inspiration for journal writing. This book gave me a great idea - to create an entire book just of affirmations. A lot of our self-talk can make us miserable or enlightened. Louise L. Hay also focuses on reflection, meditation, visualization and relaxation. She presents a pathway to a more positive and fulfilling life that is filled with daily discoveries of beauty and nurturing elements. It is time to start loving ourselves more and time to heal our lives. ""Criticism breaks down the inner spirit, and never changes a thing. Praise builds up the spirit and can bring positive changes."" ~Louise L. Hay~TheRebeccaReview.com ",1
"The Music Lesson is an amazing exploration of the chasm that can exist between reality and perception. This tiny novel delivers about as much story as can be packed into 178 pages, in prose that is spare and beautiful. The Irish village setting is palpable, the theme timeless, the characters so well drawn you forget this is fiction. More than deserving of all the praise",1
" MartinzIn one word i can describe this book entirely, Amazing! This novel contains all the elements a great novel should, a great plot, excellent characterization, and incredible scene setting. I truly felt like I was in the novel, I could feel the tension between Arthur, Lancelot, and Guenever. I could also the feel the hate the Orkney brothers portrayed. I literally couldn't put it down.Have you ever read a book that was so captivating all you did was think about it? Well if you haven't, and you want to, you should read ""the Once and Future King"", although I was familiar with the story I felt as if I was learning about it for the very first time. I couldn't believe how much their world was similar to ours, it baffled me that we live much the way they lived then. I definitely recommend everyone should read this book, since it is a classic and is alluded to almost everywhere you look. So pick it up and you wont be disappointed. ",1
"What an excellent read!  Not only well written that keeps one's attention, but this is fair and balanced, many times sounding Reagan opposition as well as laudatory.Truly a complex individual, Reagan is hard to capture without maintaining tensions, and this book achieves that.  Looking at his life in politics, it provides some background before his involvement with Screen Actors Guild, then his GE days before his governor days leading to the White House.  Then it disects his presidency from viewpoints of economics, Soviet Union, etc.One forgets just how passionate and into his love of freedom and country so this account provides this joggers so that the reader can see just how intelligent and responsible this leader was.  History I believe will bear that his was one of the significant presidents of all time, since he accomplished so much.Learned much that I had forgotten about him, e.g. his admiration of Calvin Coolidge, as well as famous wit and debating skill he possessed.  As Thatcher said of him, ""He won the Cold War without firing a shot.""  This was the Great Communicator.",1

"I am delighted to find this book available for sale.  I lost my copy several years ago and have missed it immensely. This is a delightful collection of science fiction stories and poems all with the common property that they use mathematics of some kind as their theme.  Some stories are very funny, others are thought provoking and at least one is quite touching.  They're all entertaining.  You probably won't learn much mathematics from these stories (mathematicians are warned in the forward to stay away), but if you're the least bit interested in mathematics, you will find them enchanting.  I highly recommend this book - its a gem",1
"besides &quot;next time&quot; , &quot;closest to the bone &quot; has some of the most memorable lyrics in music history. the memories of my father playing this album as a child in the early 60's are some of the fondest of  my life, and have stayed with me into adulthood. this album also showcases  the talents of keely smith and sam butera as greatly as on any other album.  keely's voice comes across so clear and melodical. &quot;call of the  wildest&quot; has,and always will stand the test of time for those of you  who love music",0
"I got a good laugh out of the sticker on the corner of ""Everything Is Alive..."" that read something like ""For Fans of Opeth, Unearth, and ASHLEE SIMPSON"". A band on Solid State Records that sounds like  a mediocre pop ""star""? Yeah right; this band definitely has sense of humor.When I first played the CD, I listened to the first track all the way through. I absolutely hated it. I then skipped through all the other tracks and listened to about 30 seconds of each. More of the same. I couldn't believe that I had wasted my money on this pile of slow-paced loud noisy garbage.  The guitar feedback grated on my eardrums, and I ended up with a massive headache. Needless to say, I took a break from The Chariot for a while.A few weeks later, however, the song ""Die Interviwer"" popped up on my mp3 player's random shuffle, so I listened to the whole song. I could actually tolerate it. Soon, I started listening to more and more songs from the album, and I was amazed by the realness of the sound, and the incredible brutality of it all: the ripping guitars, the pounding drums, and the lead singer, who roars like a man possessed. I listened to the album all the way through, and I was hooked. The Chariot is a truly incredible band, and is nothing like I've ever heard before. They draw a listener in more than Norma Jean ever will.  They are just as amazingly brutal in concert, also. However, a word of warning: You cannot just start listening to this band. A love of metal is required, and you have to be open to new styles. I would recommend listening to bands such as Becoming the Archetype before picking this album up. But it is well worth it; listening to The Chariot is a breathtaking experience",0

"I am a student of the author, David Stuart, and I have just finished his ""Advanced Maya Epigraphy"" class at the University of Texas.  I was thrilled when his book about Temple XIX was released, because he had already shared some of his insights with his students about these new inscriptions; and by reading the book I knew that I would learn even more about the inscriptions and about K'inich Ahkal Mo' Nahb, the grandson of the Pakal the great.  Within this book, Dr. Stuart unravels the texts and iconography of Temple XIX and its associated sister, Temple XXI, to reveal a story of how the king ingeniously used deep-time mythology and sacred geography to try to bring order to his rule and how the king employed the age-old Maya tradition of impersonation, linking himself directly with the two most holy Palenque characters, one historical and the other mythological - the great ruler, Janab' Pakal, and the powerful god, G1.The book is also a scholarly asset for me because, as a student of Maya epigraphy and a Palenque data monger (I can't get enough of it), I know that Prof. Stuart is the ""go to"" man for information on both.  (He and his dad, George Stuart, retired head archaeologist for National Geographic, have a new book in press on ancient Palenque to be released soon). If you have ever wondered how Maya epigraphers go about deciphering a text, the Temple XIX Inscriptions book is the perfect case study.  The volume is remarkable in that it contains here-to-fore unpublished epigraphic ideas and observations that have recently been exchanged between the top Maya epigraphers, but have never gotten into the printed record.  He calls this material the ""grey literature"" of letters and e-mail that only the few get to see.  Thank you Dr. Stuart",1
"I'm giving this CD a 5-star rating, although I believe that the material is not quite as good as that on the XXL and Swingin' For the Fences CDs.  My very favorite is XXL.  The material is exciting and special...I really enjoy Take 6 on this CD.  Swingin' For the Fences is my 2nd-favorite...Arturo Sandoval really spices it up.  Although The Phat Pack is very excellent when compared to other big band albums (most just don't stand up to even the quality of this CD), I was somewhat disappointed after hearing the other two.  For one, I don't care for Diane Reeves voice.  Also, there is only one Take 6 song.  (I would have added another Take 6 song and added one or two vocals from someone like New York Voices or Michael Buble.)  The CD title would also infer more material from the original Rat Pack, but there is really only one song from that era.  I will say that the reviewer who citicized the production/sound quality is, in my opinion, way off base.  The production and sound quality of all the Big Phat Band CDs is superior to almost everything else I've heard",0
"The book is good. But the reactions of a variety of intellectuals in the  SECOND HALF of the non english versions are as enjoyable. Why were they  left aside in this translation? The whole purpose of the magazine that  asked Martini and Eco to start a dialogue, was to open it.  Why the  trimming? Also, why was the title changed to a flashy style? The original  could be better translated to &quot;What do non believers believe in&quot;  or else. I can see other opinions on the book are produced by an incomplete  translation or a misleading title",1

Attributes such as stiffness, density,  workability, crushing strength, and hardness are specified for each wood.   It is a remarkable and beautiful book that I STRONGLY recommend",1
"I got an advance copy of Ryan Harty's forthcoming collection Bring Me Your Saddest Arizona and was blown away by the stories. The pieces in this collection hail from the other side of the emotional train tracks, a place where chaparral and saguaros fill the lots where homes and families should be. With subtlety and control, Harty makes arroyos run with missed opportunity and sunsets burn red with loneliness. Yet these stories are far from empty-through them cruise rock stars, Kachina gods and a robotic boy who's more real than real. In one story, a friend wads up another's wedding vows, while elsewhere, a brother sends his dead sister's cats scurrying into the Vegas night. Harty knows the way young lovers stumble toward one another, and he knows the phantom pains of separation. As one character points out in ""Between Tubac and Tumcacori,"" ""At a certain point in your life country music is all you want to hear."" While the eight stories in Bring Me Your Saddest Arizona lack the twang and swagger of a western tune, they contain the same essential tales of love and loss, and they stick in your head just as long, rolling around for days and days",1

"This book is fantastic! First and foremost it's a photo book full of beautifully detailed photos of katydids, frogs, spiders, worms, lizards, ants, and other smaller creatures. The species selection shows off how wonderfully diverse our planet is and will please any nature lover.Beyond the stunning 400+ photographs the author also provides tidbits of fascinating information. Since so many species are covered there's no way to give a comprehensive overview of them all, but there is enough to whet your appetite for more. In that regard I think this book would make a perfect gift to stimulate an interest in nature for a younger reader.I love this book and can't recommend it enough",1

Not only is it very detailed and insightful of the life during these times and what Ms Moody experienced, but it also enjoyable reading. It keeps you wanting to read more and is quite funny at times. A very involved and riviting book. This is a book that I will keep even after class ends and read again. My husband and son already are waiting in line to read it. A very well done book on a very tough subject. Well done Ms Moody.",1
"As a registered dietitian, I often have patients who tell me that they don't have enough time to prepare healthy meals. I always recommend this cookbook for its quick dinners. It makes it easy to put together great tasting meals, and it provides suggestions for side dishes to make it a complete meal. It provides a shopping list, and also gives you a list of foods to keep on hand, so that you always can pull together a great meal at the last minute. Add in being heart-healthy, and you have a terrific resource. It isn't for someone who wants to spend the time cooking gourmet meals from scratch. It is perfect for moms looking for a way to have a variety of health, family-friendly meals. A wonderful resource for real life",1

"Garland's out-of-print Capitol Records 1959 masterpiece The Letter, which is one of the most unique albums of her career, has been digitally remixed and remastered directly from the multi-track stereo session tapes. This lost treasure of Garland's tells the story of a relationship throughout its first meeting, a breakup, and then reconciliation. The Letter contains narration of a letter written to Garland by her beau, played by acclaimed Academy Award nominee John Ireland. As Judy reads his letter, her thoughts mend with his, and she answers him musically, through ten songs, beginning with her exquisite interpretation of ""Beautiful Trouble"" and carries us through other magnificent renditions of ""Love In The Village,"" ""Charley's Blues,"" ""The Worst Kind Of Man,"" the spectacular ""That's All There Is, There Isn't Any More,"" ""Love In Central Park,"" ""The Red Balloon,"" ""The Fight,"" ""At The Stroke Of Midnight"" and the closer, ""Come Back."" The Letter is crafted by Gordon Jenkins, a musical conductor and arranger most famously associated with Nat ""King"" Cole and Frank Sinatra. Back in those days, a concept album was a rarity and only recorded by a handful of greats, and Garland certainly ranked as the finest female vocalist of her era. For those familiar with this 1959 recording, it simply becomes a whole new listening experience. For those of you who are fans but have never had the opportunity to hear this album, trust me, you will be floored. Along with the sparkling sound, this CD features four bonus tracks, rare single versions of songs meant for radio play in 1959, and a lavish booklet that includes rare artwork and detailed liner notes by Scott Schechter, the preeminent Garland authority and author of the book Judy Garland: The Day-by-Day Chronicle of a Legend. When it comes to a Garland recording, especially one this fine, no words could fully sum up her genius. ",0
"This book is the best Italian cookbook I have found since it includes so many vegetarian recipes, which is rare in an Italian cookbook, AND recipes do not begin with 2 cups of olive oil and 20 cloves of garlic as other Italian cookbooks do. I love it also for its fun reading and different cookbook style. This one is a winner for lazy cooks like me",1
"Where this ranks in the Woody Allen opus, according to those who know, I wouldn't care to say; but for me it's the tops, up with The Purple Rose of Cairo. This is an incredibly witty and delightful work, impeccably crafted in every direction. It is deeply subtle and philosophical: there is nothing shallow about its satire. It is also extremely funny. I laughed a lot, a very lot. Maybe that supremely flat, deadpan humour, sustained to the nth degree, particularly appeals to an English sensibility. The ingenuity and accuracy of the antique filming and acting styles, and the staging of the musical numbers is astounding. Incidentally, that wasn't really Hitler at the rally, with Zelig behind him, was it? I thought that was the Hollywood version of the Zelig life story: the versions merged --- the documentary became fiction, and vice versa. Eudora's mother stole the show.  ",0
"This is the best book on aquarium fishes I have ever seen. It covers 700 species, each illustrated with a nice color photo. For each species, family name, common name, scientific name, size, distribution, temperature range, pH range, dH range, food preference and a brief description are given.  The information given is very accurate.  For example, I did not know that the red-tailed sharks are mean when they get old.Few books mentioned water hardness.  This book gives dH value for every species.  Only now I understand why swordtails did not live very long in my area.I highly recommend this book.",1

"I have read so many books, historical accounts, biography and fiction, about King Henry 8th and his marriages but it is usually Anne Boleyn who gets all the attention. It was so refreshing to read more about gentle Jane, the woman who was Queen for such a short time. She was the only one of his wives who gave Henry what he ultimately wanted, and needed so badly, a son and heir for England. She then died shortly afterwards, never fully recovering from the princes birth, and slips thorugh the fingers of history almost as a side note.This books tells her story. The book is pretty historically accurate, but not dry. The author uses her imagination a great deal to place what she thinks must have been going through Jaynes head. Its enough of the romance between her and King Henry to keep you entertained but its not a romance novel. Its an easy read that gives a glimpse inside of the heart and head of a young girl who was used as a pawn for the ambitions of her famliy who gave birth to a king. I loved it",1
"Publisher's Weekly is usually a reliable, objective source, which makes the review above all the more disturbing: this is one of the most competently written & deftly characterized young adult novels for lesbians I've seen in a long while. (I've been reading such books for 30+ years.) It's a shame the review is so out of step with the book's tone, given how influential it gets to be just by virtue of sitting here, on Amazon. The reviewer claims the characters are flat & the dialogue 'over-scripted' (huh? oh please) yet gives only 1 (very peripheral) example--which in context works quite well, as it happens. And as for ""painfully detailed descriptions of their clothes""--I'd bet money the (anonymous) reviewer was a man: this is a book about teenaged girls, hello?Ryan's characters are both distinct and quite believable; the language she uses is specific to each character, a pretty impressive accomplishment for any book but especially a Y/A one; and the (fairly low-key) trials of the two lead girls feel real without the tedious melodrama of so much teen writing. It's a refreshing and well-told story with a credible ending: as a debut novel, it's terrific. This business about 'one-dimensional' characters strikes me as either a writer so unfamiliar with the genre he had no business reviewing this, or as just plain old poorly-masked homophobia: if you don't want to read about gay teens then... don't. If you do, give this book a try--especially if you're interested in writing about Y/A lesbian subject matter. Heaven knows such books are and remain scarce on the ground. This is one of the good ones",1
"Though very hard to categorize, the Frank and Joe Show recording &quot;33-1/3&quot; is wonderful.  Not only do they create a complex blend from simple ingredients, there is something so uplifting and cheerful about the results.  That may sound corny, but it is true.  Both Frank and Joe are virtuosic players and their arrangements and performances of diverse material, from jazz to pop standards, are unusual and delightful. Check it out",0

This classic hymn has been illustrated by Mary Morgan in a way that really brings the meaning of the words to life. My favorite thing about this book is that it contains illustrations for all 6 verses of the song- not just one or two! The music is included so you can sing or read this to your child. What could be a better way to teach your little ones that truth that God made all things,1
"This is an excellent study on the contemporary stage director Robert Wilson. I have read Dr. Holmberg's book in pre-release.

"it was wonderful to return to Cage's hometown and spend days in suspense. There have only been a couple books written by Greg Iles that didn't hold my interest. This certainly wasn't one of them. Like in most books there was a period about 2/3 of the way through that he could have moved on a little faster, but the story was interesting, sad, perhaps almost too true and brought so many aspects of life in a small southern town. The ending certainly did throw me, I wonder how many others will be surprised. I hope he does more books using a similar setting.",1
"This film is not only amazing cinematically, but also in context.  The story follows the life of Francisco de Goya very well, and I feel it successfully conveys the emotions (and insanity) he went through at the end of his life.  Artistically, every scene is visual perfection in composition and effects.  Contextually, the philosophical and psychological motifs are deeply insightful.  This is definitely one of the best films I've seen in my lifetime",0
This product is better then most. Now I am sure if you want to pay over$100.00 for a monitor it MAY be better but for the price and what I need it for it works GREAT!!!! I love the choice of channels and that if the baby is sleeping I do not have to hear static and hope I can hear if he is chocking. If the baby moves this monitor picks it up. Also the light indication is a plus.Great monitor! I would recommend this product,0

"This book is over 200 years old and still popular. There's a good reason for that.It captures all that people love about slapstick, and doesn't worry about toning it down for the kids. The two heros drift from town to town, bordello to bordello, and bar to bar. They're petty grifters, always trying to pull another meager scam, and always getting the worst of it in the end. There's no real plot here, just a sequence of vignettes. They're all like enough in kind to create a rhythm, but different enough to stay entertaining. Lots of the humor is low - potty humor, not restricted just to human waste. As in some britcoms, our heroes suddenly appear in their underwear time and again - or out of it, or next to it, or looking up into a tree at it. The real fun is in their silly pranks and exaggerations, always found out in ways that make them look like total twits.Ikku Jippensha's work is still a good read, even today. Sometimes, though, English doesn't capture the flavor of the original. The translator just shouldn't have bothered with some of the puns, and a few turns of phrase probably sounded better back when this was translated. End-notes are scanty, and there appears to be a systematic error in page number references towards the end of the notes.None of that really interferes with a good read. Enjoy the prat-falls as much as the original readers did, 200 years ago and in Japan.//wiredweir",1

"""Official"" is a word used to denote, in the case of price guides, an authoritative source of information, one that can be trusted above all others. In the case of David Ellis' Guide to Classic Video Games, it is exactly that. I have been collecting and playing video games, both console and arcade, since the late 1970's. Other price guides I have encountered have focused on specific areas of interest within the video game field, but none have covered consoles AND arcades AND handhelds as thoroughly as this book. Mr Ellis gives sound advice on how to get started in a hobby that has only recently moved into the mainstream. There are source lists to aid in searching for that rare find or for gathering even more information. The price guides themselves show a range of prices on each item as well as rarity and variations where applicable. There are plenty of color and black & white photos, and the history of how video gaming got started is an interesting and pleasant addition. It is clear in his writing that Mr Ellis endeavors to share his knowledge and passion for the hobby. I found the book to be accurate and helpful in my collecting, and I recommend it to both novice and experienced classic video game enthusiasts",1
"Certain soul groups are so smooth and beautiful to the ear that they reach way inside to a pleasure center that doesn't get tickled any other way.  The Delfoncis come to mind, and so do the Stylistics.  Both groups came from Philly, and both were backed by producer Thom Bell who relied on lyrics from Linda Creed.  Both featured soaring falsettos, in the case of the Stylistics it was Russell Thompkins who led the way.  While ultimately the Stylistics did not have the staying power the Delphonics would enjoy, their highs were just as high and they left us with some pop standards that will never go out of style.  As long as there is romance, there will be reason enough to put on the Stylistics, and this CD delivers the ""must-have"" cuts in one neat package.  Their anthem, People Make The World Go Round, sounds as fresh, sweet, and relevant today as when it was released.  Betcha By Golly, Wow says what every lover wants to say and every lover wants to hear.  Break Up To Make Up is bittersweet stuff, stinging with truth.  You Are Everything is another ballad of crystalline beauty, as is Let's Put It All Together.  Even the second-best songs on this disc were big hits in their day; this is a highly select offering.  Everybody likes to rock out and everybody likes to Wang Chung, but if there's a part of you that resonates with the gentle vulnerability of love offered up like a flower, you will find that this music wraps you like a warm coat in winter and a welcome breeze in summer.  Betcha by golly, wow, you're the one that I've been waiting for.",0

"As management consultants in organization and compensation, as well as management book reviewers, we are all-too keenly aware that the achilles heal of leaders is very often, their inability to seek, get and properly use good advice.This book addresses this need, by presenting critical, to-the-point insights into this quintessential leadership subject. To do so, it offers a framework for advice taking and an understanding of the attributes of great advice taking. The core propositions of the author are: 1) actionable, timely and sustainable advice is essential to achieve organizational change; 2) it is the leader's responsibility to identify needs for advice and choose and use advisors wisely, and; 3) leaders must achieve the appropriate mindset to be good advice takers and master the skills to take maximum advantage of advice given them. Among the nuggets in this book are rules and fundamental principles of advice taking, the four types of advice, and the attributes and abilities of a skilled advice taker. The book offers important insights into a subject that may seem a blatantly obvious dimension of leadership, but is often neglected, poorly understood, and taken for granted. This book is a very important contribution to the essential literature on leadership. We highly recommended it all who are, or strive to become, leaders",1
"I'm glad to see a reissue of this classic in hardcover.If you are interested in bullfighting, Hemingway or Spain you should find this book interesting, enjoyable reading.It is a playful introduction into bullfighting and at the same time a reminiscence of Spain and bullfighting.The book deals with the art of bullfighting as it existed in the twenties.  That said, most of the passes, techniques, tricks, foibles he describes still exist in bullfighting as it is practiced today. And while not extremely deep on the technical side of the subject, this is the most readable of any book on the technical aspects of bullfighting I've come across.  If you want to understand the basics of bullfighting, this would be an excellent place to start.Hemingway profiles a handful of matadors.  They are all from impoverished backgrounds, basic peasant stock, that despite the fame and money they never can quite leave behind this past.  It was a much more dangerous profession then, before the advent of antibiotics when death from a septic wound was a risk from even a minor goring.Hemingway is unrestrained in his love of Spain and this shines through the book.

"I really loved this book. She travelled as a new bride with her anthropologist husband to Iraq in the 1950's or '60's, I believe. She had so much to learn and go through adapting to a new culture. It's great that she's there because her husband would never have been allowed to talk to the women. They were very segregated, so Ms. Fernea learned all about the half of the society that male anthropologists usually can't even learn about due to lack of access. She made friends, had to relearn how to cook rice (different water amount), and you really get a personal look at the culture. She kept in touch with many of her friends from that time. I can't wait to read her other books",1

"After completing his scroll version of On the Road in April 1951, Kerouac was still unsatisfied and wanted to break away from its ""conventional narrative survey of road trips etc."" In October his architect student friend Ed White suggested to Jack: ""Why don't you just sketch in the streets like a painter but with words?"" Kerouac tried it, and was gripped by the power of the new technique which lent a new form of spontaneity to his writing. He began straight away, enthusiastically rewriting his Road book in this new fashion. The first 36 pages of Visions of Cody are pure sketches, recorded in the streets, subways and diners of New York in the fall of 1951. This new publication, Book of Sketches, contains over 400 more pages of sketches, typed up by Jack in 1959 from the original small breast-pocket notebooks in which they were recorded. They begin with sketches of life at his sister's home in Rocky Mount, North Carolina in August 1952, just after Jack had returned there from Mexico City where he had completed work on Doctor Sax. Jack describes his work on the North Carolina railroad just before taking off on the road once more on a mammoth hitch-hike to California, via Denver, and the new Cassady home in San Jose. Then follow sketches of Mexico from December 1952, and one on an airplane flying from St Louis to New York, a previously unknown trip taking Jack back home in time for Christmas.In the following year Jack sketched while on a visit to Montreal in March 1953, and during his railroad work at San Luis Obispo, California that April, before taking off by sea for New York and a meeting with ""Mardou"" during the summer of the Subterraneans. Sketches of Jack's work on the Long Island railroad in October are also included , as well as more descriptions of the streets of Manhattan and Long Island that fall. The book comes to a close with a glimpse of life in San Francisco in early 1954, and tagged onto the end are a few sketches recorded during Jack's big overseas trip of Spring 1957, to Tangiers, France, and England.The writing is superb throughout, and particularly the description of what must have been Kerouac's longest ever hitch-hike, 3000 miles from North Carolina to California in late August 1952, via Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, and Nevada, a trip not previously mentioned in his other writings. Jack lists each town he passed through and describes practically every lift he obtained on the way. Reaching Denver, Jack spent a whole day sketching Neal's old haunts, including Zaza's barbershop, the Glenarm poolhall, and Pederson's. But as well as sketching the scenes before him, Kerouac also explored philosophical topics, such as his Spengler-inspired sympathy with the Fellaheen, in his ""Notes on the Millennium of the Hip Fellaheen, Oct. 1952, California"" and planned his future with them -- ""Go among the People, the Fellaheen not the American Bourgeois Middle-class World of neurosis nor the Catholic French Canadian European World -- the People -- Indians, Arabs, the Fellaheen in country, village, of City slums -- an essential World Dostoevsky.""This has to be one of the most important pieces of Kerouac's writing to have been released in several decades. As well as providing further examples of Kerouac's innovative sketch-writing, it also fills some gaps in the Duluoz Legend. It will become an essential part of the Kerouac canon. The marketing of the book raises some queries, however, since it is described on the back cover as a collection of ""poems"" and is published in the Penguin Poets series. Kerouac always seemed quite clear that his sketches were not poems but prose. In his definition of a sketch (in Some of the Dharma) he notes that ""A sketch is a prose description of a scene before the eyes,"" and on the title page of his typescript wrote: ""Book of Sketches -- Proving that sketches ain't verse."" It is clear, though, that sketching led to Kerouac's development of the spontaneous poems he called Blues, which he began in 1954 with San Francisco Blues, continuing with his classic Mexico City Blues the following year. Whatever, it's the content of the book that matters, and this is quite simply outstanding, and essential for any Kerouac enthusiast.",1
"This beautifully illustrated large book shows what's happening in club/discotheque design. Like a lot of the daab books, it basically has no text. Instead it is a collection of high quality photographs showing the latest trends in club design from around the world. And around the world really means all over the world vrom Brazil to Peru, Japan to New York, all over Europe, behind the old Iron Curtain, Israel and more. Clubs seem to go through styles. From the original dingy cellers to high style, then back to the celler with the warehouse look of exposed beams and utilities, and more recently to a wide variety of styles that combine nearly any look from living room, to theater, to cave. Consider this as an idea book for club design. It's what the top designers around the world are doing these days",1
"This was the first Baby Faith video I bought for Daniel when he was 8 months old. I had already tried Baby Einstein and was really disappointed with his less than favorable reaction. But ""God Made Animals"" absolutely fascinated him!! I bought two other Baby Faith videos and I have never been disappointed!I love watching Daniel while he is watching this video. He gets so excited by some of the scenes and so calm and mesmerized by other scenes. I am so happy with the simple message of ""God loves you"" that is delivered throughout the video and the baby-oriented Bibles stories. These are great beginning videos for babies and young toddlers. At 15 months, they are still Daniel's favorites",0
"""Monster Island"" is only the second book in the Buffy/Angel series of books to have been originally released in hardback. The only other one was the Buffy book, ""Immortal"". Why this is, I don't know, but I got the just released paperback. The tale is written by one of the premiere handlers of Buffy fiction, Christopher Golden. He co-wrote it with Thomas E. Sniegpski. One knows that the characters are going to be handled well and written for accordingly with Golden involved. This is a Buffy/Angel crossover novel, and the best one to do so so far. The story is large and quite epic. Someone, or something, is killing of half breed demons in Sunnydale at an alarming rate. A ways away in the City Of Angels, the same thing is happening there. Angel realizes that the connection strikes a lot closer to home and soon Buffy and her gang are in L.A. to fight alongside Angel and his compadres. The character of Doyle, who figured prominently in the first 8 episodes of ""Angel"", is part of the plot and it's a most welcome connection. The big finale takes place on a magical island filled with all sorts of races of demons. Buffy and the others must fight the great evil before thousands of half breeds are slaughtered. The meshing of the two worlds just runs smoothly here. It always does, but this one has almost everyone getting together, except for Giles, Anya, and Dawn. The characters are all written as they would be on the show by the most knowing of standards. There are demons galore here, and just may be one of the most demon packed series in the franchise.  I can't tell you when it is placed, as in what seasons, because there is no information on that given. Buffy talks about being brought back from the dead, which would mean season 6. But there is a point in the book where Wesley says they had just broke Faith out of jail, which happened in season 4 of ""Angel"", which ran during season 7 of ""Buffy"", but there is no Connor, who was a regular member during season 4 of ""Angel"", and a couple characters visit the ruins of Sunnydale High, which was restored in season 7 of ""Buffy"", so who knows when it actually takes place. Did anyone follow that?. There's a number of things here and there that a Buffy/Angel fan would remember and get. Sure to put a smile on your face. The story is one of the strongest in the line of books, and is written solidly with a sharp eye for detail and characterization. Each individual series of books, Angel and Buffy, keep getting better and better. And when they crossover like this, it's just pure golden. Christopher, that is",1
"Greg Brown kind of takes care of you when you put on one of his records. You know he's going to get it right and make you feel the way you want to feel: contented. And so it is with this one, a collection (an odd collection in many ways) of mostly old tunes. The one I love most is 'Foggy Foggy Dew' which is a perfect, rather sad, but lilting folk song, beautifully arranged. Like all the tracks on the album, the sound quality is, as we've come to expect from Greg Brown, to audiophile standards. If you've got a decent hi fi, it's like having him right there in the room with you. Every song on this album is carefully, but simply crafted, and I suspect it's something I'll want to listen to for many years yet",0
"This film from Martin Scorsese surpasses all other cinematic re-tellings of Christ's life. To discuss this movie, however, one can't avoid the question of the controversy that to this day surrounds it. Fundamentalist Christians deemed the film blasphemous before they even saw it, due to its portrayal of Jesus as equally God and man. This idea, though, is firmly placed within the Bible and creates a three-dimensional character out of Jesus (as opposed to the two-dimensional Jesus in The Passion of the Christ). Here, Jesus is wholly divine and wholly man, confused and all-knowing. He is the ultimate paradox. Jesus's conquering of temptation and his triumph is inspiring. While Scorsese worked under a very limited budget (and it is obvious in many instances), the film is still a masterpiece, thanks in no small part to Peter Gabriel's mesmerizing score. This is one of Scorsese's absolute best and one of the best films of the 1980s",0
"View Camera Technique is a fantastic, all encompassing book  covering not only view cameras, but all aspects of photography. Everything you've ever wanted to know is in this book. It will be a reference book that I will pull off the shelf for years and years. Well done and well worth the price",1
"This is such a lovely, lovely, neat little book. It was published in 1997 so I am truly amazed that I am the first person to review it. It is a well-crafted, beautiful ""book"" even if you look at it just from the physical standpoint without considering its content. It is a small hard cover book printed in India by Sri Aurobindo Ashram Press and the cover and end papers are made by the Ashram. It is a beautiful natural color with bits of plant fiber showing and even smells faintly of plants. The book has interesting vintage illustrations with lots of enchanting atmosphere added by the inclusion of Art Nouveau accents. The writing inside is very homey and gentle and shows a light-hearted reverance for life. Mr. Cabarga is a self-titled plant psychic who discovered as a child, that when he spoke to plants they flourished and also that if he listened with his inner self he could hear them speaking as well. This book has a decidedly ""New Age"" theme and I for one often find New Age books cloying in their sugary preachiness, but this one is so sincere and humble and genuine that I found myself letting my guard down and fully accepting this gentle person's experiences and lessons in empathy. He shares his inner conversations with many different plants and also a moving conversation with Pan, the god of the Greenwood. The last chapter is a message from Mother Earth channeled by the author. Even if one were to read this book purely as a fairy tale which, ironically, from the standpoint of plant deva consciousness, it actually is, one will be treated to a loving sense of oneness with Nature that is a gift indeed. There is much wisdom in this little volume, some whistful sadness, and great joy. Even if one chooses to regard it as fiction it offers a sensitive and deep look at the green world that cannot help but have an effect upon one's view of the web of life and one's own place within it. I take this book quite literally. I consider the fact that hemin, the red pigment in animal blood, and chlorophyll, the green coloring in plants have chemical structures that are fundamentally the same except where chlorophyll contains magnesium, hemin contains iron. This book illustrates in thoughtful, lyrical prose the same message that this scientific fact reveals, namely that we are all one, we living beings. Discover a wonderful opportunity for relationship that is all around us. This book can open that door",1
"Group Home's 1995 debut album ""Livin' Proof"" is a gorgeous and beautiful hip hop album that is certainly very underappreciated. This album teams the MC duo Lil' Dap and Melachi the Nutcracker, two talented and unknown teenage rappers from New York, with the legendary DJ Premier on the mixing boards, arguably the greatest hip hop producer of all time. The result is a truly special and unique masterpiece. The majority of the enjoyment in ""Livin' Proof"" comes from the production, which is the most diverse and my favorite of his entire career. His sound is very focused, and the theme of ""low budget environment"" is played very well. Premo's beats sound less polished than on a Gang Starr record, and instead of his usual horns and instrumentals, he often uses heavy, creative sampling, and a simple drumkit and keyboard to make simple, beautiful beats. His music has a very nostalgic feel to it, and this production is experimental without sounding at all futuristic. His music really is capable of evoking a lot of feelings and emotions. Lyrically I am impressed with Dap and Melachi, and I really can't begin to comprehend the three and four star ratings bashing these two rappers. I guess in 1995 people were only used to hearing Guru and Jeru the Damaja over Premier beats, and granted Dap and Melachi are not quite on their level, but they really do a phenomenal job on the mic. Despite their young age, they have a very worldly intelligence, and they speak of life in an often depressed, downcast tone that comes from living in such abject poverty. Despite their tough situations, though, they continue to look forward. ""Livin' Proof"" is an amazing rap album that is really unlike any other I've heard, and I recommend it highly to all types of music listeners.The album begins with a 40-second intro that displays why DJ Premier is one of the top producers of all time. With just a piano and drumset, he makes one of the coolest little beats I've ever heard, and it just eases you into the album so well. ""Inna City Life"" introduces Dap and Melachi, both dropping some raw philosophy gained from years in the ghetto, and Premo's simple, staticky beat is hard and gritty. The beat to ""Livin' Proof"" is raw but attractive, simple and ear-catching, and Melachi and Dap establish themselves as new young truth-kicking rappers. The chorus samples Wu-Tang and Nas in Premo's signature two-bar fashion. ""Serious Rap S..."" has an electronic, ultra-funky beat that will make your head bob instantly, the raps show great flow. A highlight of the disc is ""Suspended in Time,"" a very nostalgically and thoughtfully produced track with verses to match. ""Sacrifice"" has cool guitars on the production, and harder raps than usual. ""Up Against tha Wall (Low Budget Mix)"" has bouncy vibes and my favorite lyrics on the album, expressing the depressed and pessimistic view of inner city life. ""4 Give My Sins"" has some muted horns and a simple beat, with introspective lyrics. Premo steals the show on ""Baby Pa,"" making not one but two completely dope beats on this track. I love ""2 Thousand,"" with its winding deep piano and great chorus (""95 is yours, 2000 is mine, and we walkin' through the ghetto and the feeling is fine...""). It's followed by ""Supa Star,"" another classic single. My favorite song on the whole album is ""Up Against tha Wall (Getaway Car Mix)."" It's another mix to the song earlier on the album, but Premo's slower, simple piano lined-beat is absolutely perfect, and he engineers a nice chorus for this mix. The album ends with the tough song ""Tha Realness.""""Livin' Proof"" is an album so exceptional and musical that I don't think you'd have to be a rap fan to enjoy it. In my mind, it showed the world that the legendary Premier didn't need Guru or Jeru to make an awesome record, and I think this is maybe his greatest musical accomplishment. It is really unlike a Gang Starr album in every way, but Gang Starr fans will probably enjoy it immeasurably as well. I could not praise or recommend ""Livin' Proof"" any higher, this is really a one-of-a-kind type of album",0
"There are books that grab you as a reader and don't let you go.  This one did both personally, professionally, so much so that I focused on it and never left my chair until it was totally read.  It is mindful and reflective drawing me in as a reader and revealing much about the directions I taken in my life. My core energy has kept me afloat in all my roles.  This is one book that will be re-read and dog-eared. Its internal energy has led me to want to Evangelize to others.As an educator of children and teachers I intend to spread this information as a way of anchoring their personal learning profiles for themselves and students to a new level. The Human Fabric gives key information to source of a personal profile. This information will allow all learners to work on a team and to have stronger inter and intrapersonal skills. These skills are highlighted in the SCANS report as key for the workforce of today and the future.  If an educator or a learner knows their core energy personal work and teamwork will be more successful. This author smoothes the information about one's core energy, leaving few places to trip or become lost as the goal is clear and full of energy.  This energy provides the substance from which these other facets of individual grow, learning style, preferred intelligence, and thinking style. As a writer I was so pleased to see that the novel I recently finished was about Mavens, Relaters and one Evangelist and how they connected.

Great music, a lot of folk, part bluegrass, part pop. Great combination. Add the good looks from Aoife and you have all ingredients to sell this album. I realise that a live show in Europa is far from realistic, but i think there shows to be awesome",0

"""The Gathering Storm"" was a good bit better than what I expected.  I thought Robert Hardy's portrayal of Churchill in ""The Wilderness Years,"" some 20 years ago, could not be topped.  Albert Finney has proved me wrong as his is as good if not better.  Of course, the storyline is frustratingly similar.  The premise is that over 90% of the British public are opposed to war with Germany in the 1930's.  Many actually sympathize with the Germans for what was seen as unfair terms of the Versailles Treaty.  British political leaders pander to the mood of pacifism with one exception:  Winston Churchill.  Churchill stands alone in his concerns for the Nazi war machine as it is built up in the mid-30's.  British pacifists adopt a program of appeasing Hitler and his Nazi gangs with the inevitable result. Weakness invites agression as we've seen in our own time and soon the British face what they wanted to avoid most: World War II.The story begs for a sequel and we hear one is now being formulated, to include Albert Finney as Churchill.  Let's hope the other main stars are brought back, as well. Kudos to HBO for actually making movies for thinking adults.  Shows like this are few and far between. Grab this DVD while you can",0

"Felix Mendelssohn said that the music of JS Bach could makes Christianity understandable to anyone. Ward Swingle makes JS Bach understandable to anyone. Regardless of one's taste, it is elevated by this collection. This is captivating, wonderful, fun music. It's perfect to play for your ""...no, I don't like classical music"" friends. It's like playing the Tocatta and Fugue in Dm and having people say ""Hey, that's the music from Rollerball!"". If you want a sample of the Swingle Singers or even just some enjoyable music, this is a great buy at this price! Plus they throw in some of Mozart's most beautiful music on this set. If you haven't figured it out, I heartily recommend it",0
"If there is a Donald Trump in the nanny business Ms. Kline would surely be hosting the next Apprentice show except that she does not seem to have the same gravitaz that Mr. Trump demonstrates.  Name-dropping and full bragging of how important she is to the ""over achieving"" parents who are basically folks trying to integrate work and family lifestyles does not make Ms. Kline a likeable decent person.  (Whether you agree with how the parents are spending their time or not)Instead of being empathetic, Ms. Kline comes across as a self-ordained I-am-a-very-important person in Washington.  She brags about the fact she can choose you as a client and gets more important clients than she really cares for.The book is a quick easy read, but there is no substance and a lot of snide remarks on Ms. Kline's clients make her a character that any parent should stay away from",1

"A Naturalists guide to urban Chicago, the title &quot;Field &amp; Street&quot; is a play on the famous magazine title. It is a wonderful compendium of some of the best articles of the last few years from Chicago's famous free weekly newspaper, The Reader.  As a youth growing up in the &quot;inner city&quot; I thought the only animal life to be found here were pidgeons, rats, cockroaches and sparrows.  Thanks to Jerry Sullivan I discovered (among other things) that the sound of a distant jackhammer was really a nearby Woodpecker.  Most &quot;Windy City&quot; residents thought of the Chicago River as a stagnant sludge pool ready to burst into polluted flames at any moment before Jerry began describing the natural wonders to be found on it's shoreline.  His articles encouraged me to enjoy the city jogging paths that bring one close to that beauty.  And beyond the unexpected wonder that Sullivan's articles bring, is his tremendous writing skill.  Even if you don't care about the mallards, storks and cranes that can easily be found if you know where to look, you'll find what he has to say about them fascinating",1

"When I first saw this film I was surprised to see that it was a film Herrmann did the music for, but I didn't care for it. I think it was mainly because it was a late night and I was tired, so the film seemed to drag on. Months after that I heard a recording of a piece of Taxi Driver from the City of Prague Philharmonic, orchestrated by Christopher Palmer. I thought that it was exquisite. It was the best version of the score I ever heard. I rented the film after that and now I watch it quite a bit, and I also look forward each time to hearing Herrmann's dark haunting score. I love to listen to this cd in my truck, mainly at night since that was when the score was mainly written for. I feel like Travis Bickle seeing the problems that are still in our world today. The sad part of Bernard Herrmann though is that during the year of 1976, Herrmann had received two Oscar nominations from the films Obsession and Taxi Driver and died before seeing them. Herrmann could've wrote more music throughout the years since he was only 64 when he died. If you are a Herrmann fan, this soundtrack has to be in your collection, because it's the last original soundtrack that Herrmann wrote, not counting adaptions of his music in other films.  There are some things that should be mentioned though.  Bernard Herrmann, at the time of this recording, was in very ill health, and it was even a surprise that he came back to Los Angelos at all (he was living in England at the time, and had just finished recording two scores with the National Philharmonic Orchestra; his Oscar nominated score for Obsession, and his own re-recording for Psycho, which as a matter of fact, his friend Laurie Johnson had to help conduct on, as well as some sequences in Obsession). He was able to write the film music obviously, but the theme wasn't done entirely by him, but with help from his other friend Christopher Palmer, who took some music from a previous piece Herrmann had written, then added his own few bars that he named as a matter of fact (at least I think the few other bars that wasn't Herrmann's music, were Palmer's). Then when it came to have the film score conducted, Herrmann needed a conductor due to his health, so composer and orchestrator Jack Hayes was hired to conduct. This all has nothing to do with Dave Blume's recordings. I really do wish, after reading the biography, that Arista records had paid attention to this, because I'm not so sure that Herrmann would've wanted other people's services unnoticed. Otherwise, a fantastic album, Herrmann's last Oscar nominated score, and a tribute to a master of film composing that we lost too soon.",0

I want to go work in the garden, take rest on my Adirondacks, read your  reflections and let the work of my hands baptize its pages.

"I started this book before going to bed and finished it when I woke up the next morning.  I will admit, I was skeptical of the overall death/ice theme but somehow Hoffman worked her magic and made it all work.  We watch our main character emerge and find her true self through the pages even as she loses her family to death. I love the blend of science (lightening, especially) and nature (butterflies, moles, orchards) that play important parts in the story and help teach lessons of death and rebirth. I found the story lyrical, suspenseful, hopeful, and uplifting.  ",1

"Maybe M. Night's movie ""Lady in the Water"" didn't make nearly as much as it should have, but he is and will continue to be a REAL artist.  Michael Bamberger's (a REAL artist and true reporter himself) book ""The Man Who Heard Voices"" is a testament of M. Night's dedication to his craft.  He tells of the man who has enlightened and revitalized our imagainations with all of his movies.  Sadly people now a days all seem to be film and book critics and are so involved in intellecutalizing creativity right into its grave.  We need to remember why we go to movies, why we tell stories, why we asked our parent's to tell us that bedtime story one more time.   Bamberger's book (and Night's movie) do this very thing.  In fact, they are this very thing. This is a book that should be read by all.  Not only because it's about M. Night Shyamalan, but because it's about a man who is trying to help us all rememeber we have imaginations.  Bamberger writes simply and truthfully about M. Night and in the end it's beautiful.The book is written very well and is so good that you could easily read it in one sitting.  What do you have to lose?  Nothing.  Read the book and remember why we are all alive.  (Just in case you forgot, we are alive not to be skeptics, but to believe in something, even if it is just a story.)Thus, book = awesome.  You need to read it",1
"I recommend -- five stars up, ""Lincoln's Assassins: Their Trial & Execution."" For this genre, Swanson & Weinberg have set a new standard of excellence.  It is about events that occurred after the assassination and burial of President Abraham Lincoln.  While the plot may be morbid for some - nonetheless,  it is enticing for anyone searching for truth, justice, and a good-old-fashion read. The writing is vividly done, the photographs are mesmerizing,  and the documentary evidence: overwhelming in presentation and abundance.Those who study numerology might find it interesting that James Swanson and President Lincoln were born on the same day. Like many successful entrepreneurs, Mr. Swanson discovered at an early age, his passion in life.  He started collecting artifacts about President Lincoln when he was ten years old.Since becoming an investor in many companies, I know the importance of mergers, compatibility, and symbiotic relationships. Consequently, it was amusing to discover Daniel Weinberg has been the owner of a book store for more than thirty years that specialized in books dealing with President Lincoln.Even though the events took place more than one hundred thirty years ago, the authors have compiled evidence and supporting materials in a way I could still feel the suspense, drama, and intrigue that was evidently experienced by those living during this historical period. Napoleon Bonaparte once said:  ""A picture is worth a thousand words.""  If you accept this premise, you will love this book as there are scores of photographs (along with eloquently done text) that help the reader form a compelling, and coherent analysis of events that transpired more than one hundred thirty years ago.Chapter four is the beginning of the conspiracy trial, which was unprecedented in so many ways. Presided over by President Andrew Johnson - it was initially going to be conducted in secret. At the last moment, compromises were made to allow selected people to attend.  The book reads like an episode of ""24 (the television hit). Each page is tantalizing, breathtaking, and thought-provoking. One of the eight facing execution was Mary Surratt. The human drama, suspense, and turmoil involving her part in the plot, kept me riveted, intrigued, and captivated.  The book is exceptional and has my highest recommendation.Reginald V. Johnson, author, ""How To Be Happy, Successful, And Rich""  ",1
"This book is a collection of various texts by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716). Leibniz was a first-class mathematician, and also a first-class philosopher. In mathematics, in parallel with and independently  of Newton, he developed infinitesimal calculus, the indispensable  instrument of modern science. In philosophy, he published, in 1710, in  French, one chief work: &quot;Essay on Theodicy, the Goodness of God, Man's  Freedom and the Origin of Evil&quot;. The most important of his  philosophical works were published at various times after his death: the  Discourse on Metaphysics was published in 1846, and most of his esoteric  texts on metaphysical issues were published in as late as 1903 (L.  Couturat, Opuscules et fragments inedits de Leibniz) and 1948 (G. Grua, G.  W. Leibniz, Textes inedits). Leibniz wrote scarcely, if at all, in his  native languague, German. He preferred to write in Latin or French. This  volume contains selections, in translation, from many of his chief works,  including some outstanding texts from the 1903 Couturat edition. These  include a text on &quot;Necessary and Contingent Truths&quot; and &quot;A  Letter on Freedom&quot;. Leibniz distinguished truths (statements) into  necessary, i.e., mathematical or logical truths, and contingent or  existential truths. Those truths are necessary whose opposite is  self-contradictory, i.e., impossible. On the other hand, contingent truths  are those whose opposite is not self-contradictory, and therefore possible.  Examples of necessary truths are given from arithmetic, while examples of  existential truths are &quot;that I am now alive, that the sun is  shining&quot;. Leibniz develops, based on this distinction, a superb  metaphysical theory on the structure of causation and of the freedom of the  will. The importance of these excerpts can hardly be overemphasized, and  for these texts alone the book should be worth possessing. This volume also  contains excerpts from better known texts by Leibniz, such as The  Monadology, The Discourse on Metaphysics, and Leibniz's correspondence with  Arnauld and with Clarke. Leibniz is a superb and original thinker in  philosophy, as he is in science and in mathematics. His style is crisp and  dry, not lofty and poetical as is the style of his contemporary B. Spinoza.  The great metaphysical questions (free will, predestination, God and man)  are attacked mercilessly and unto their ultimate logical conlusions.  Leibniz's full awareness of the scientific achievements of his epoch, makes  him a thoroughly modern thinker, up to this present time",1
"The world of show business is not a place where shrinking violets bloom.  On the contrary, it is known for bombast, opportunism, and egos larger and more gaseous than zeppelins.Consequently it is rare indeed to find an act featuring two prodigious talents who have chosen to share billing equally.  This extraordinary gesture of selflessness is indicated by the word - AND - which links the two names.A small handful of examples comes to mind where two geniuses are paired.  The Captain And Tennille, of course, The Fluorescent Leech And Eddie, and the late lamented duo, Wayland Flowers And Madame who, tragically, died simultaneously.Add to this distinguished list the names, Sam And Dave.  These powerhouse singers, who secured their place in history with a few hits covered by shabby second-stringers, simply define everything that is good about R&B.  In fact, if you were beginning an R&B collection, this outstanding CD would be an excellent place to start.You'll find barnburners like Soul Man and I Thank You, among many others, but you may be surprised how these guys work a ballad.

"As usual, this is a wonderful story.  In this outing Falco is commissioned by the vigiles and his friend Petronius to find a killer.  The victim is an owner of a scriptorium and a bank.  He also has an ex-wife and a current very young wife.  It is a particularly gruesome murder, and as Falco investigates he finds that there is no shortage of suspects.  The murder victim had many enemies and people who might have wanted him out of the picture.  This is more of a classic mystery story than some of the others in the series, although we do learn a lot about ancient Roman banking practices as well as their publishing businesses.  The denouement is set up by Falco in a room where he brings in all the principal players.  Rest assired. he does find the killer, and he gets a confession",1

He's taken his seminal masterwork and transformed it into another entity that is equal to or may even surpass the original.I love the original ""Whipped Cream"", but this CD is a masterstroke.

"This is a great and comprehensive collection of the folk music of a little-know Scottish singer who released two albums (both covered here - the second quite superb) in the early seventies and then disappeared for the next thirty three years.Heavily influenced by the great Joni Mitchell with a twist of Joan Baez, but also with an British sensitivity more popularly found in Sandy Denny and Nick Drake, Shelagh was developing so rapidly between her first and second albums that she has to join the great line of ""what if?"" artists who showed so much promised but were then silenced one way or another.Shelagh was another drug casualty. However instead of meeting her demise she fled back north to Scotland after a bad acid trip in London left her hallucinating for three weeks and with a voice that sounded ""like a cat being strangled"". She cut all contacts with her associates. ""Suddenly, I had to get out. My disappearance wasn't at all conscious. It was a coping mechanism:  self-preservation."" Thereafter she led an anonymous urban life from home, followed by years of living rough in a tent with her partner, crossing the highlands and islands of Scotland and staying close to nature. ""I love the lifestyle"" claimed Shelagh last year.For the mystery was finally solved in 2005 after a Scottish newspaper, The Scottish Daily Mail, printed an article on the mystery folk singer prompting Shelagh herself to appear out of nowhere ""to let everyone know I'm safe and well"" and to give us the second half of the story. For full details check out: www.btinternet.com/~blackvelvet/ if the page is still there. Anyway a bucket of royalties awaited her (perhaps of no interest) and she reported that she is writing songs and enjoying music again, voice restored.Msytery solved. Happy ending? Hopefully the lady herself, now 57, truly has been happy in her wanderings. We will still never know what riches of glorious singing we have missed, whatever may happen now. So get a hold of this excellent and (I understand) complete collection of her recorded work. The second disc has the whole of ""Stargazer"" which would be the price on it's own. Some great music here. Do what I did - take a chance. No regrets - it has been played frequently for many weeks now. Good sound quality too, on this 2005 release from Castle Records",0

"Love this gate - we have 2 blocking stairs and kitchen.  One comment on installation - you MUST use the measure tape/ruler they provide to locate where the gate hinges are fastened to the wall, that's why the top will pop out (on an earlier review).  Eyeballing it is not the way to fasten it.  There are specific heights to install that make this gate safe.

I then found myself skipping pages, then chapters, just stopping long enough to read the quotes tucked among the verbiage and was relieved to finally come to the last three pages which I felt short changed the title of the last chapter.  I guess if one was really bored and really hard up for something to read you might discover something that I didn't find.  The author elaborates endlessly on what is obvious.  We all have relatives like this whom we avoid asking questions or sitting next to at gatherings.  Save your money and purchase something more worthwhile",1
"Reviewed by Beverly Pechin for Reader Views (8/06)""Jack's Life"" is truly an inside look at the life and times of famous author, C. S. Lewis from a perspective nobody else could give you but his own step-son, Douglas.  First glance at the book and it's elegant cover tells you immediately that not only was there a lot of thought and care put into the making of this book, but no scrimping on presenting the reader with a wonderful personal view of Lewis' life was ever even an option.  An exquisite hard cover book with a detailed embossed cover to protect this cherished book is only the beginning of the author's way of expressing the care taken.  At a mere list price of under $20 the elegant hard cover book not only offers some great reading material, but a bonus DVD that adds yet another touch of class to the experience.  Even the most well read of biography lovers has not been given a chance like this to see the inside life of the world renowned C.S. Lewis.  Focusing not as much on his writings and his thoughts as a writer, but more on his every day life and hardships that helped to create the man he was.  A wonderful look at what later became known as the true ""home"" of Lewis; Douglas fondly remembers the stories told by so many others regarding the beginning of the love/hate relationship Lewis came to have with his beautiful Estate.  With so much work needing to be done, Lewis was remembered not only as an extremely hard worker, but a determined man with so much character that he took on the extended family of a friend who died at war while serving with Lewis.  Submitting to a life of poverty at times, simply to take care of them all!  This alone shows the intense character of the beloved author and, after reading the life Lewis accepted as his own to simply fulfill the obligation of a pact he shared with his close friend, brings one to realize that this is a man of integrity.The author shares everything from the relationships Lewis had with the ""inherited"" family, the mother and sister of a friend and fellow soldier in war, to the often shaky relationship he had with his own father; the touching love and relationship he shared with his brother, Warnie; and later the loving and tender relationship he shared with Douglas himself.  Touching ever so briefly on the friends and acquaintances with whom he also shared numerous conversations and intricate details of the books he wrote, the author shows the inside influences of other famous authors, such as J.R. Tolkien, and some not-so-famous people that met together in a group weekly for intellectual discussions.  This small group of intellectual geniuses and intimate friends became known as ""The Inklings"" and provided Lewis with many intense conversations and criticisms that influenced nearly all of his writings.""Jack's Life"" is simply one of the best biographies I've read in ages and shares intimate details and touching antics of Lewis' life that no other author could share accurately.  Seeing the loving relationship and utter admiration that Douglas Grisham had for his step-father gives the reader a feeling of truly knowing the inside workings of an intriguing man.  Sometimes humorous, always intimate and completely touching, this is one biography that will not only leave you smiling from the knowledge shared but remembering to add on the many other books of C.S. Lewis that you may not have read yet, simply to experience the man you've learned about all over again",1

"This is a tastefully selected anthology for mourners that Alan Kay put together after the passing of his father. It combines traditional Jewish writings with some more contemporary pieces of literature. The Jewish tradition has many great works , Psalms, Lamentations, Job , and many others which express the spirit of mourning in a deep way. This book also includes an account of Kay's own personal process of mourning which is also moving and helpful. A very good work- the prayer is that none of us should need it.",1
"Unfortunately, my experience was completely different. Starting with the unprofessional shipping. Shaver and components were shipped in a box stuffed with old newspapers instead of professional packing material. Shaver and Trimmer are almost exactly lifesize in the screenshot on this page!! I felt mislead by the pictures. Another person said how impressive the shaver is. I had the exact opposite experience. I picked it up and I was more than underwhelmed. The shaver is about the size of a saltshaker and the battery accounts for the weight, not the motor. Not to be mean, but the shaver reminds me of something I might pickup in a 99 cents store. The other day I found a far better shaver from Remington for about $8 in my local Raley's store. Of course, to find out about this Seiko shaver first hand you'll need to open the shrink wrap which then in turns makes it almost moot to return the item, because Donner charges a 35% sanitary disposal fee if you open the item. On top of that the shipping charges are also non-refundable. On the other hand, if I return the $8 grocery store shaver to the store, I'd get a full refund, if I'm not happy with the product. Ok, so how well does it shave? Not bad, but also not any better than the $8 shaver from my grocery store. The blade component seems extremely flimsy (essentially 3 tiny blades stuck to a piece of plastic) and if you do decide to use this shaver, you'll be ordering replacement blades in no time. All in all, I was not happy with my purchase in the least. $60 spent on something that should be around $10",0

"The high-tech industry has inadvertently put programmers and engineers in charge, so their hard-to-use engineering culture dominates. In our rush to accept the many benefits of the silicon chip, we have abdicated our responsibilities. We have let the inmates run the asylum. When the inmates run the asylum, it is hard for them to see clearly the nature of the problems that bedevil them. When you look in the mirror, it is all too easy to single out your best features and overlook the warts. When the creators of the software-based products examine their handiwork, they overlook how bad it is. Instead they see its awesome power and flexibility. Programming is such a difficult and absorbing task, that it dominates all other considerations, including the concerns of the users. Programmers aren't evil. They work hard to make their software easy to use. Unfortunately, their frame of reference is themselves, so they only make it easy to use for other software engineers, not for normal human beings. Why high tech products drive us crazy and how to restore the sanity? This is what this book is about.Because it is far cheaper for manufacturers to use computers to control the internal functioning of devices than it is to use older, mechanical methods, it is economically inevitable that computers will insinuate themselves into every product and service in our lives. This means that the behaviour of all of our products will soon be the same as most obnoxious computers, unless we try something different. The incredible power of computers means that few people can afford to ignore them. Even if you don't have a desktop computer, you probably own a VCR and an ATM card, which are software-based products. It is unrealistic to simply say you ""won't use computers"". They aren't just getting cheaper; they are getting ridiculously cheaper, to the point of ubiquity and disposability. Many familiar products that we imagine as mechanical (or electronic) are no longer made without computers. Cars, washing machines, televisions, vacuum cleaners, thermostats and elevators are all good examples.This book is written with humour, liveliness, and amusement, it has a lot of funny illustrations. Yet it reveals the problems of software industry which were left attention for decades. One of the problem is ""elastic user"", such a user which must bend and stretch and adapt to the needs of the moment. When a company speaks about the software it develops, every party involved (management, programmers, testers, sales) include different meaning into the word ""user"". In ""Goal-Directed design"", the participants never refer to ""the user"". Instead, they refer to a very specific individual: ""a persona"". To create a product that must satisfy a broad audience of users, logic will tell you to make it as broad in its functionality as possible to accommodate the most people. Logic is wrong. You will have far greater success by designing for one single person. Imagine that you were designing an automobile to please a wide spectrum of people. You could easily identify at least three subgroups: the soccer mom, the carpenter, and the junior executive. Mom wants a safe, stable vehicle with lots of space and big doors for hauling the kids, dogs, groceries and other stuff. The carpenter wants a rugged vehicle with all-wheel drive and abundant room for ladders, lumber, bags of cement, and tools. The young executive wants a sporty car with a powerful engine, stiff suspension, convertible top and only enough room for too. If we make such a combination vehicle, what a goofy, impossible car will appear! Making three different products in software is lot easier than making them in steel, too. Another problem which the author points to is ""the customer-driven death spiral"", where ""conceptual integrity"" is the only solution.The author declares that the key to solving the problems is interaction design, and exposes the Goal-Directed design method that provides manufacturers of high tech products with an insightful understanding of their users and a practical blueprint for a superior result. Alan Cooper, the author of the book, and his company, have designed a wide range of products ranging from clean, simple kiosk systems to complex scientific applications, controls for consumer-oriented computer peripherals, conceptual designs for entire product lines, eCommerce sites. The list of companies that adopted the Goal-Directed design includes many industry leaders, large and small, such as 3M, Proctor & Gamble, Dolby Labs, Fujitsu, HP, Informatica, Logitech, SAP, Charles Schwab, St. Jude Medical, and Varian. The description of Goal-Directed design in this book is very reader-friendly and is targeted to the broad audience. Alan Cooper gives the further explanation of this method in his following book ""About Face 2.0"", aimed mostly to the engineers. Although these two books are still not enough to deploy this method in your organisation, they show how vital this technique is for a successful product",1
"As intricately layered and briskly paced as the movie adaptation, the original source novel is an excellent entry in the crime noir genre. Sleazy, smoky, and seductive, this is the infamous Los Angeles of the mid-twentieth century, filled with political corruption, Hollywood scandal, and unchecked crime syndicates. The novel explores deeply the motivations and fears of LAPD police officers Bud White, Jack Vincennes, and Edmund Exley as they investigate the suspicious circumstances surrounding the Nite Owl massacre. The seemingly straightforward murder case begins to unravel, enveloping the three protagonists with the demons of past and present. Prepare to be surprised at every turn of the page. This is an especially nice treat for fans of the movie",1

"This DVD (by Reelin' In The Years Productions) would be worth the cost even if it were just of the Newport festival. As it is, there are three separate classic concerts on the DVD (Newport in 60, Copenhagen in 68 and Norway in 77). The album (and CD) of Muddy at Newport has always been a favorite of mine, and to see it live is amazing. What can I say, it is Muddy with one his all time classic bands including Otis Spann and James Cotton. This is what they sounded like playing in the Chicago clubs. The editing, which includes cutting between the band and the audience reaction, is excellent. This concert took place in July 1960 and it represents one of the first exposures of black blues to white audiences in the US. As a musician,it is interesting to see Muddy and band using classic Gibson and Fender equipment; guitars and amps which are now considered classic vintage equipment and cost thousands of dollars. These guys played blues the way it should be played, with passion and harmony - not mindless noise and soloing. Any beginning blues musician (or rocker) should buy this DVD to see some classic examples. One highlite of  show is watching Muddy do a little dance with Cotton. The second and third concerts were shot in Europe and you can see the integration of Muddy's band with Paul Oscher and Jerry Portnoy on harmonica and Bob Margolin on guitar. Margolin is still keeping the Muddy tradition alive today by his excellent work with the Muddy Waters tribute band (which includes some of Muddy's old sidemen). The European concerts occured in 68 and 77 and watching Muddy age adds poignancy to the DVD. There are bonus sections of interviews with Muddy which give a rare glimpse into the man himself and the liner notes (actually a booklet) by Bob Margolin (who is also a writer for the magazine Blues Revue) adds very interesting historical and musical insights. Any music fan must add this DVD to their collection and it is a must have for every blues fan. I would rate this DVD in the same category as my other favorites, namely Freddie King's The Beat and The American Folk Blues Festival DVD's, which were also produced by Reelin' In The Years",0
"Having read and studied Russian writers in the 19th century, and being not only amazed at their complexity (particular Dostoyevsky's) in terms of philosophy, plot, and generally forboding prose, reading Hugo was delightful. What he may lack in comparison to some great Russian authors in terms of hard-core atheist philosophy (Ivan Karamazov) and intense psychological study, he makes up for with beautiful prose, decorated with gorgeous similes and haunting images (the novels final image is one that will stay with me forever), and a truly great love story. Not a Hollywood-esque love story, but a true love story, one of dangerous passions, haunting obsessions, irrationality and fatal mistakes. Read this novel then read Les Miserables. Both books manage to create a feeling that no other novel is able to create. Dostoyevsky is a brilliant philosopher and amateur (that is, not officially qualified) psychologist, while Hugo is one of the great humanists and, without a doubt, perhaps the greatest French Romantic. It is no wonder that he was buried in the Pantheon.As may be obvious, this book bears no resemblance to the Disney story. It is incredibly serious, at times saracastic, harrowingly dark, and poignantly brutal. Take the Disney version and turn it on its head. It is that different.Read this book. Do not skip a chapter, even when Hugo goes off on one of his historical, literary or any other sort of seemingly un-related discourses. They are crucial, perhaps not to the plot, but to the themes of the novel.Again, read this book",1
"I kept hearing KEM this and KEM that, everyone telling me you've got to check out KEM, so I bought Kemistry based on everyone's recommendation.  I listened, and WOW.............. I just love this guy!  The FEELINGS that comes through those speakers, this SOUL and SPIRITUALITY takes you to a traquil state of mind.

"I had spent the past several years informally studying Stirling engines, and this book vastly improved my understanding of the workings of this kind of engine in the course of a week. Stirling engines are known for their great efficiency, but the one historic difficulty preventing the widespread deployment of these engines is power density. (Stirling engines tend to be far larger than other less efficient engines of the same power output, so much so as to have been impractical for many applications. . . until now) The challenges to the development of a power dense Stirling engine are examined one at a time, and explained in both common terms, as well as formulas and equations, though admittedly, some of the text was rather hard to understand without a great deal of effort. This is understandable; this book is, after all, aimed at engineers.The book comes in two parts: chapters 1-4 are by Theodor Finkelstein, and cover a pretty detailed history of air engines, including the Ericsson engine, and the Stirling engine and its variants, from their invention and early history through the beginnings of what Allan Organ calls the ""dark ages"", a period of about 50 years when virtually no work was done on this kind of engine. Allan Organ authors the book from chapters 5 through the end, and covers the rebirth of the Stirling engine in the 1930's through the present. His approach is a lot more technical, and relies much more on equations and other technical explanations.If you are a casual hobbyist, or simply investigating Stirling engines without a background in mechanical engineering, I still recommend this book. Do not let the equations intimidate you; get as much out of the rest of the book as you can. This book offers the collected understanding of many years of research into the cause and effect behind the operations of this class of engines, and if you are willing to work to understand it, you will find this book to be very helpful to your research",1
"Though knowledge of H.P. Lovecraft's ""Cthulhu Mythos"" enhances the enjoyment of this brilliant work, it isn't necessary. Tyson's Necronomicon traces the detailed path of the Mad Arab from his expulsion from Yemen into the desert to his final mind-shattering demise in Damascus. This text would also make a great sourcebook for the popular Call Of Cthulhu role-playing game from Chaosium. Lovcraft would have been delighted",1
The Steroid Bible explained the reality behind steroid use and sport long before the current baseball steroid scandal. Athletes who compete at the highest level are encouraged by society at large to break records and make a lot of money. People don't want to see mediocre play. Society rewards athletes for great athletic performance even when it is widely know what many athletes do to achieve it. The Steroid Bible explains how society can allow athletes to compete at the highest level in a safer manner,1
"I ordered these speakers to try to create a home theater system with existing equipment we already had.

I didn't get to use the speakers, but I'm confident they would have sounded amazing since Sony makes such quality products",0

"To be fair, in 1962, I was a 7 year old grom riding my skimboard on the Linda Mar California beach while my cousins longboarded. No wetsuits then-pre Jack O'Neill. Milius did an excellent job capturing that era. Sam Melton aka The Bear reminded me of my Uncle Jack Blair. Gruff, fair and experienced in all things. Every town had a trio of surfers like Leroy, Jack and Matt in those days. Probably still true but I'm the old guy on a longboard now so I wouldn't know any personally. Any surfer over 45 can relate to this movie and if anybody younger than that wants to relate to older surfers like their Dads or Uncles, they should watch this movie. My only beef was that there were no Hawaiians in the movie, only haoles. There were Hawaiians surfing in SoCal in those days, passing on the Aloha. But, that's a minor thing. Funny thing, I still dress the same, even at work as I did in those days-jeans, flip flops, tee-shirt or an aloha shirt. I guess I'm still in a Big Wednesday time warp. I hope I never leave. ",0
"Once again, Corporon's integrity shines through with this effort, a worthy addition to his numerous wind symphony recordings. I must disagree with the criticism of the Schwanter in the previous review. From a Dark Millenium is  not titled &quot;For Percussion&quot; like the other mentioned piece. The  balance is probably intended to make sure that every line in the music is  heard. It is still loud enough to shake the trunk of my car. Overall, the  recording deserves much accolade",0
"I bought this book along with ""Meditations for Manifesting"".  Together, these two items are powerful.  I read the book every night and practiced the meditations morning and night.  Within a week of starting both, miraculous things started happening in my life.

Follow Dr. Dyer's suggestions and meditations AND trust ...it does work. ",1
"First of all, let me just say that I have read both this book, and seen the documentary ""Grizzly Man"" with the central subject being Tim Treadwell's obsession with Alaskan Brown Bears. Obviously, to quote from this very book ""Tim Treadwell proves that smoking dope fries your brain"". This moron humanized bears, and had his own agenda that really had nothing to do with bear conservation, or even the study of bear behavior, but rather self gratification. Nick Jans does a really good job of trying to present the arguments from both sides, while at the same time, trying to maintain an unbiased opinion. I would say that this book is a perfect example of what NOT to do in bear country. This jackass Treadwell ignored all of the research and facts known about bears, and not only got himself killed, but took an innocent woman with him, not to mention the two bears that were killed in connection with this incident. Altogether, this is a very enjoyable book, and regardless of your opinions of Treadwell (I think that I have made mine clear at this point), there is a small sense of admiration for the guy. Not many people would have the cajones to live amongst the most powerful animals on the North American continent for 13 consecutive seasons. A must read.   ",1
"This novel is about the identity of the individual, and the possibilities and limits of self-reinvention. By failing to transform himself into someone else, Mattia Pascal remains the same person, but radically changed from his experience. Oh, but it's not so complicated.  Mattia Pascal is a good-for nothing- junior who, along with his also-spoiled brother, lose the fortune inherited from their father. Besides losing his fortune, Mattia is forced to make a disastrous marriage. And then, along comes a big and most unexpected chance to run away and become someone else. I won't spoil anything. Just read it and you will find an amazing story. Pirandello's writing is easy. The introduction to the real knot of the story is a little long, but it is absolutely necessary to situate the plot, and moreover, it is very funny. Pirandello's style fluctuates between irreverent and outrageous irony, and melancholic reflections on fate, identity and man's place in the world. Far from being boring, it has extremely funny moments of dark humor (check his confrontations with his mother-in-law). So, it is an extremely recommendable book, because it is intelligent humor with a reflection on life. If you really get to love the story, as I did, you'll end up asking to yourself: &quot;Who the hell am I?&quot;",1
"This is an ok book if one is curious about Fibonacci ratios and techniques. I did feel that effort in the examples is really modest and the book doesn't have much depth to it. The author does seem to have a good grasp of the subject, but the idea of a book is not just to illustrate the concept, but to thoroughly explore the theory and make observations and comment on exceptions and patterns. It remains as one of the few books on the subject, so one may want to read it anyway ..2 star",1

"Most of us whose salvation and saving grace in the late 1970's came in the form of punk rock never thought it would come to this: a coffee table-style book on the genre so large it almost requires a truss to pick up and read. Exploding with stark black-and-white photos, the authors rightfully trace punk's origins back to the Stooges/MC5/Velvet Underground unholy triumvirate and primarily use quotes from musicians, hangers-on, and the fans to tell the story of the music so many thought would change if not the world, then at least the industry. Although an integral part of the whole sordid saga, it would have been nice if the authors had sacrificed some of the space devoted to The Sex Pistols and the Sodom and Gomorrah of punk (New York and London) and examined the scenes in Australia and elsewhere. Nonetheless, despite the small quibble, this is a glorious addition to the library of any music lover, punk or otherwise, and another testimonial to why music in the 70's casts such a huge shadow over everything that's come along since",1

"The emotionally healing benefits of orange oil and lavender become immediately apparent when you apply this to your scalp. If you can find someone to give you a head massage with this product, then you can truly relax. If applying this yourself, it works well as an at home hair treatment to nourish the hair follicles and promote healthy hair growth. You will also notice your hair becoming stronger and retaining a much deeper shine. The essential oils in this product help to activate micro-circulation which may cause a slight tingling and warming of the scalp. Leave this in for about 5-10 minutes and then wash your hair as normal. You may find you need less conditioner when using this product. Many hairdressers will use this product when giving a conditioning head massage and that is where I first found out about this product. I bought my first bottle the day I had the massage. I was that impressed and I keep buying this product. ~The Rebecca Review",0

"This is actually the first album that I have ever listen to from The Black Crowes. For some reason I never got around to listening to them before and didn't know what they were all about. A friend of mine who's a big fan of theirs lend me this album to listen to and I was blown away. I love every song they sound really good, I am a big fan of classic rock and blues and the Crowes mix these two styles in practically every song on this CD and they do a fantastic job at it. My favorites are ""She Talks To Angels"" (a beautiful ballad and soul stirring) I also love ""Remedy"" this song jams and I love both the lyrics and music on this one. ""Jealous Again"" and ""Hard To Take"" are awesome. ""Thorn On My Pride"" is a great song as well and the lyrics are very nice also. This is a great album overall and I am glad that my friend let me this album to listen to. I now know what I had been missing by not discovering this band at an earlier time when they were in their heyday which was in the 1990's. I'm going to buy this album right now because is a great one and I have to included in my music collection of all time great rock n roll albums of all times. I look forward to seeing The Black Crowes live, I hope they're still touring if they sound in concert as great as they sound on record than they are a really great rock band which as far as I am concern just by listening to this fantastic CD they are indeed",0

"If you ever get the chance to go to the Big Ditch (aka the Grand Canyon National Park), do so. It is WELL WORTH the trip. I've been twice, including once to see the sunrise over the mountainous gorge. But it was that first trip that was unbelievable.We stayed in a cheap motel (I'm sure you know the number) in Williams, Arizona, and we hopped a train the fifty or so miles to Big Ditch. As an avid reader, there wasn't much other than sage to see out the window, so I picked up this book. And I simply couldn't put it down.It tells story after story - every known story in existence, in fact - of those who have met the Grim Reaper in the Canyon. The number one question - by far - is, ""How many people have died here?"" This book not only answers that most common question, but also tells each known story (or at least the finding of the body) in riveting detail.I expected it might make me rather sick. In many cases, wasted lives of people who didn't have to die and all too often impaired by the 'two beers' that all DWIs have traditionally had right before getting stopped. It starts with the desperate pleas of a woman who has gone too far as dusk settles in and ends with her lifeless body being put aboard a chopper.It will captivate you, frighten you, and make you think twice before you do something stupid at the Big Ditch.HIGHLY recommended.",1
"This record could plausibly lay claim to being the best pop album of the 1980's.  It relies heavily on the backbones of Motown and 60's British Rock, which are the foundations of Anglo-American pop music, without ever being immitative or reductive.  ""Would I Lie to You,"" ""There Must Be An Angel"" and ""It's Alright (Baby's Comin' Back)"" are all superlative pop singles, and the latter provides a direct link with Annie Lennox's most important predecessor, Dusty Springfield.While ""Sister's are Doin' it for Themselves"" has never been one of my favorites--I find the lyrics to be rather trite--there is no doubt that it is one of Eurythmics perennially popular tunes.  And ""Conditioned Soul"" and ""Adrian"" are two of the very best Euryhmics songs never to be singles. Add to this the inclusion of their very best b-side, ""Grown Up Girls,"" and you have a great remastered album. With this album, Eurythmics became a rock band, and reached the peak of their powers.  It is the one Eurythmics album that sounds like a universal people-pleaser.  Not as experimental as their first three, but in no way less interesting, entertaining or satisfying.  A truly superb pop album",0

"I don't often watch foreign films.  The reason being, as an American, I don't feel that I can ever fully grasp the cultural and linguistic subtleties needed to truly understand and enjoy these works.  French....  Spanish....  German...  etc.... regardless of nationality, genre, or time period, they generally leave me cold.   With that in mind, I went into this with no doubts as to the film's greatness, but again, didn't think as an American I would be able to see it, as the situational nuances would be lost on me.   As it turned out, I was wrong, and found a sublime masterpiece that went down easily, and didn't seem obtuse or ""foreign"".   The experience could best be likened to watching ""The Graduate"", as you find yourself viewing seemingly mundane events and conversations, but the subtle turns in those events and words speak of such depth and gravity that you feel almost driven to your knees by the masterwork that you are watching. I won't recap the storyline, or discuss details of the movie itself, I just wanted to say that I went into this skeptical, expecting to find a picture that I couldn't relate to, but what I found was an immediate, compelling and moving work that speaks volumes of the human condition.",0

The duet with Mick jager on You`ve gotta walk (dont look back)gave the album an instant hit.

The dub mixes are interesting and ""sly and Robbie"" supremacy on the rythm section is quite solid and innovative. Highly recommende",0
I recently finished working on a local State Senate race where we used Shaw's book as a manual for each course of action in our campaign.

"This is the ""must have"" book for any guitar player that loves Bob Dylan's music.  The large format of the book allows the pages to be well spaced and the music and lyrics easy to read.  The chords have finger charts with it to help with proper finger placement",1
"This book is so good, my teenage son has discovered that he can use it as a better reference than his textbooks. The book is neatly written with a clear concise style. In addition to grammar, the book is a great resource for questions about usage, punctuation and spelling. As a journalist I need to have resources such as this readily available. I keep this one next to Strunk and White",1
"This book was used as one of two texts in my art school figure study class included in our school portfolio of supplies. It is also a text used in an ecorche course at another art school.  My highest recommendation, is to study this book, along with Frank Netter's  medical anatomy book focusing on the osteology and myology sections that apply to artists, leaving behind the details that do not apply to artists. The illustrations in that book are second to none.  Also, as many other good artistic anatomy books you can find, as the more you understand, the better. Lastly, get a good poseable medical skeleton. Yes, save up for it, like I did. It is absolutely essential. A realistic sculptor of the human figure must know the body from the inside out.  Pictures alone in books are not enough. You must see the structure of the body in the round. Then I reccommend getting Bruno Lucchesi's ""Modelling the Figure in Clay, A Sculptors Guide to Anatomy"". Do the exercises using this book , your skeleton as a model, putting on the bones and muscles, one by one. This is a spectacular learning experience to build your own ecorche (flayed) figure",1

"I read this book after having read Agamben's big book ""Homo Sacer."" I found the analysis of bare life (homo sacer) in that book to be so fascinating that I picked up ""Remnants,"" to see where else Agamben might go. This book is some of the most compelling theory I have read to date. The book has three major categories of analysis: the witness, the musselman (literally, the muslim), and shame. Each of these three categories have to do with the inhuman quality of being human and the speakability of that which is unspeakable. Indeed, Agamben deploys subtle thought in order to construct these internal contradictions that actually played on in the extreme case of Auschwitz. As one might expect from the title, this book is haunting. The testimonials given of the Musselman are particularly disturbing. Indeed, the experiences of Auschwitz is unspeakable. Perhaps, most startling is that Agamben argues our modern political paradigm is basically a sedated Auschwitz in which all of us can be turned into Musselmen, indeed, the musselman is that inhuman potential within our humanity. In short, this book is haunting, captivating, yet, unspeakable in the topics it tackles and the issues with which it wrestles. If you are not acquainted with Agamben, then, you might first be taken off guard by his verse and thesis style. But once you get in the flow, the form of his writing adds to its content.",1

"Though not for the impatient, this companion to Lattimore's translation of the Iliad is quite accessible to the non-specialist. Difficult passages are explained by making reference to archaelogical and linguistic evidence, other ancient texts (including the scholia and the Odyssey), and recent research on the transmission of oral literature.The reader is thus better able to place this seminal literary work in its proper context. Willcox helps us understand the cultural, political and human forces that shaped the Iliad during the centuries it was an oral poem, and the slight variations it probably underwent once committed to the written word.Overall, an outstanding work of scholarship.",1
"Jonathan Culler has done a marvelous job writing exactly what the title promises. Unlike some of the Short Intro books (like the Foucault one), Culler understands that the people reading the book are novices at literary theory and need to be walked through the concepts but not in a condescending way. Part of the problem with having major scholars write short introductions to their field is that they know too much and it is often hard for them to remember how little everyone else knows. But Culler is a rare author who does not seem to have this problem at all. He never lost me.My favorite thing about this book is the first section which talks about theory in general, and answers the question, ""What is theory?"" If you've been confused about all the theory terms you've heard, deconstruction, Foucault, Derrida, postmodernism etc. etc. etc. blah blah blah, and if you feel like you don't understand all the categories of theory, and don't understand how literary theory interacts with other types of theory and who all the major thinkers are in this whole movement, then this book, like none I've ever seen, will set you straight.The rest of the book is great too, though I question the marginalization of the discussion about the different schools of theory by sticking them all in the appendix. Why not give them their own chapter",1
"When I first started playing fable I was amazed how much possibility there was to forge your own destiny. Where one simple decision could alter your destiny for good or evil forever. When you start out as a young boy who's village is burned, plundered, and the entire town murdered, you feel sorry for the boy as his life has been taken from him. From then on he is to become a hero.As you embark on a long journey and make choices along the way you will forge you own personal destiny. With a well written storyline to back it up this game amplifies your freedom to forge your destiny.",0
"Jason Robert Brown sure knows how to tell a great story with lyrics while setting it to a catchy tune. Although some of the songs in ""Wearing Someone Else's Clothes"" seem out of place with the rest of the tracks, they each are perfect as stand-alone musical theatre/jazz/rock/etc. If you are familiar with JRB's musicals (esp Songs for a New World), you'll notice that the references in this album are beautiful and haunting.The true beauty of this collection of songs is in its powerful collection of messages. Love, loyalty, loneliness, jealousy, failure and triumph - if there is one thing that Jason Robert Brown is divinely gifted at - it is capturing a full range of human emotions and desires all in a single song.Fans of JRB's love songs will find themselves replaying the contemporary love-song track ""Someone to Fall Back On."" For those who are interested in pissed-off singer/songwriters who enjoy complaining about having to sell-out in their field in order to suceed, try ""Gettin Out,"" a fun little rant that seems to be written first person.  Another gem of the collection is the song ""Nothing in Common,"" which is about two brothers, one who was successful at a young age and the other who was a failure, at least academically. In the long run it turns out that although they ""had nothing in common"" they ""are more or less the same."" When you hear this song and reach this statement, it will be a moment of profound listening, no matter how many times you replay the piece. And last but not least, I have to recommend the song ""Long Long Road,"" which seems to fit almost as a preface to Songs for a New World - it's wonderful inspiration for those of us (myself included) traveling through life, not quite sure where they're headed.When contemporary pop artists are singing about intoxicating behinds (ala the Black Eyed Peas) and broadway is continually being reduced to mindless profit-making musical clones, Jason Robert Brown makes music that might not change the world, but that at least has some serious inspiring notions. It'll make you laugh, cry, want to dance and of course want to sing along - I highly recommend you buy this album for your collection",0
"I bought this for my 4 year old grandson and he loves it---the problem is, his 8 and 12 year old sisters do too.  The blocks are so different from all their others, and the figures on the box are easy to replicate, even for the 4 year old",0

An excellent book for older students",1
"While I have many problems with the movie itself the music is actually very good.  True it is mostly head-banger stuff but there are a few interesting surprises as well, I mean come on who can't love Manson, Disturbed AND Papa Roach.

"There are several reasons why I dig Sarah Vowell and this book, Assassination Vacation.  For one, Vowell is an unapologetic history geek.  She is willing to go the extra mile to see the place where an assassin experimented with hippie style free love in the 1800's.  She's willing, no enchanted, with the idea of visiting some obscure site where Robert Todd Lincoln once fell on the railroad tracks.  She goes the extra mile so we don't have to, see?  But for me, that's just it.  I do want to go that extra mile.  I am also a history geek, and Vowell's book brings out the Nerd Nerdy McNerdington in me, wanting to visit all of these out of the way, unheard of trivial places just like she does.  Secondly, she does a really good job of telling a story, as I believe all good teachers must do, and she does it in a witty, eloquent, sometimes verbose, definitely tangential way that I find endearing.  Most history students in the world would rather do anything else than read about some 1800's dead people, but Vowell has the talent to make those stories come to life.Finally, there's the history she reveals, most of which the average Joe would never have known.  I won't include the spoilers here, but I have taught for 15 years, have a college degree in history, and was unaware of many of the details of Presidential and assassination history to be found in her book.Toss in a somewhat macabre sense of humor and a striking resemblance to Wednesday Addams of Addams Family fame, and you have the makings of an entertaining weekend",1
"As the author put it, the Army gave him a choice, he could walk or he could fly around Vietnam. At nineteen he already had five years of flying experience. It isn't hard to guess which option he choose, especially since by now you've certainly read the title of the book. His tour of duty ran from June 1967 to June 1968. During that time he flew 1600 air hours. A normal work year in the US is 2000 hours. He was basically in the air for a year. And he was there during some of the worst possible times: Hue and Khe Sanh, operations in the A Shau and Song Re valleys. This was the most dangerous job that the Army had, one in eighteen didn't come home alive. The book is dedicated in memory of James Arthur Johansen. He is pictured on page 193 a few hours before he was killed. Mr. Johnson came home with a chest full of medals. He doesn't mention what kind of a reception he received when he came back, but 1968 was the time when the reception was not good. He deserved the medals, and I hope his reception was good. Thanks, Mr. Johnson, for writing this story",1
My wife and I found lots of great help in this book.  Detailed enough for our academic minds.  Honest enough to be helpful in a difficult time.  And staightforward enough to be understandable.

"I wish we had this book at Wharton.  This is an excellent book on Monte Carlo modeling and optimization, among other things.  You just can't beat the value of the book + software, and I personally like XLSim better than Crystal Ball because it gives you the EXACT SAME result, but in a much faster time frame and with far less complicated programming.  Dr. Savage teaches you while you do the examples in the book.  It is truly a great way to learn a complex, but very rewarding subject.  You'll never do an IRR or NPV proforma analysis in the same way again",1
"Dolph Lundgren has finally done it! He finally decided to school his enemies at, well, a school! Yes! A genius indeed, Dolphage played an ex-soldier named Sam Decker who taught at a less-than-continuation school where cussing is the only language the kids know and girls are pregnant everywhere. &quot;Detention&quot; is so bad, it's good! Stereotypes have never been used this much, but the director achieved major insult to teens. Decker wanted to quit since he finally realized that High School High was below him and that the kids stunk, but the principal demanded that he stay and watch one, final detention class. Pity. A group of maniacs who dressed like Billy Idol took over the school and 'locked down' the school property. Of course, the movie went into &quot;Under Siege&quot; mode and Decker became a one-man army. The children band together and unite! A girl goes into labor, a wheelchair bound teen goes into a flurry and manages to outrun a motorcycle, another boy lives his self-fulfilling prophecy of actually getting courage to fight back and the whole gang construct this metallic/spike/shield thingy and fight bad guys in the gym! What an extremely entertaining movie and Dolph Lordgren delivers high-caliber action once again. What a deity he is! Yes! Two hots, thumbs up, and ten toes up, all the way",0
"I bought my Mom one of these because as a frail old lady she just can't handle a big thick plush terry towel.  She *adores* these microfiber towels!  However both she and I agreed that this particular size is just barely big enough to wrap around the head, and I happen to have a rather small head for an adult.  However we had just been discussing the sorry state of our kitchen towels, and how perfect this particular one would be right down to matching our color scheme.  (Caveat: The color of the actual towel is a hint more 'dust roseish' than the rich orangeish color shown on the Amazon webpage.)  I find that I like having a seperate towel for my hair but this size just doesn't quite make me comfortable and it would have been useless when my hair was waist-length.  So when I can afford to buy more of this particular size, they will be used in our kitchen",0

It includes sprouting charts, drying times for dried foods, Lists of every vitamin and mineral with the corresponding foods--even an alkaline/acidity chart. The recipes are simple.

But this book is a must for every Raw kitchen--the most accessible Raw food book I've come across, and Thank You Brigette Mars for including research on uncooked foods--good research--there's a lot of hocus-pocus, magical thinking out there in the Raw Food World, and this is a breath of fresh air, because it's smart and straight forward",1

"I used the book Exploring InDesign CS for a Desktop Publishing class, where I was taking it as an independent study.  First of all, this is my second copy of the book, and the pages are literally falling out of it.  I have had to clip the pages together in order to keep the pages from being misplaced.  Secondly, the book has some issues as far as the projects are concerned.  Each chapter leads you through an assigment, and then there are projects at the end of each chapter.  It seems, many times, the author adds things to the projects that have not been practiced in the chapter.  It was extremely frustrating.  Some of the assignments are flawed, and cannot be completed according to her specifications.  It also would have been helpful if she had more pictures relating to the specific activities and assignments.Overall, I would not recommend this book to anyone",1
"The Choir of Trinity College, Cambridge has youthful energy and also mature musicality in this delightful, but still very serious recording of sacred choral Christmas music. Perfect diction, dynamics, and tone, led by Richard Marlow, director. The second disc is better than the first--it contains less traditional music and more unaccompanied British choral music, what the choir does best. A great gift for choral enthusiasts and traditional carol lovers alike.Best tracks: ""What Cheer?"" by William Walton, ""The Three Kings"" by Peter Cornelius, ""Coventry Carol"" by Kenneth Leighton, ""Hymn to the Virgin"" by Benjamin Britten, ""Tomorrow shall be my dancing day"" arr. by David Willcocks, ""A Great and Mighty Wonder"" arr. by Richard Marlow",0
"A Christian friend bought this book for me as a present. I started reading it with an open mind but only managed to read the first 4 essays within. I have a high school education of Chemistry, Biology, Physics and am currently doing a PhD in Mathematics. I say this with all honesty: every time I read a piece of the book and put it down, I felt dumber!The simple truth is that the ""experts"" who wrote each of the first four essays really have no idea. They often make very direct false scientific statements. Meanwhile they propose that they are ""scientific"". I then flipped half way through the book and read a paragraph where the writer was trying to suggest that radioactive decay can be sped up. Almost all scientists understand that it is a random process that can not be changed. Therefore, the half-life of radioactive decay can not be changed (sped up or slowed down).If you are a Christian who is wishing to make yourself feel intelligent whilst upholding your faith, this book is for you. However, if you are an independent scientific thinker, I would not recommend this book",1
"Stellar performances from all of the cast.  The story is compelling, and you really get to fall in love with Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, who is accused of a horror of a charge that he did not commit.

"Definitely ""Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction"" is not J. D. Salinger's most popular and most read work. People who read this book are die-hard fans of this writer and really like the Glass family and are interested in knowing more about them. Those who want to read only one or two Salinger books should stick to ""The Catcher in The Rye"" and either ""Franny and Zooey"" or ""Nine Stories"".To begin with ""Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction"" is not an easy book. Its rhythm is like a roller coaster, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, sometimes up, sometimes down -- but always difficult and inaccessible to those who are not familiar with the Glass's mythology and history. Even Salinger habitus may find some difficult in reading this work. ""Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters"" tells the story of Seymour's wedding. But, the main character here and narrator is Buddy Glass, the groom's brother, who is the only member of the family to attend the ceremony. All the narrative deals with the fact that Seymour abandon's his bride in the church and doesn't show up. Buddy is forced to deal whit the situation. He is forced to be with some guests, who happen to be bride's relative. And most of the time he pretends not to be Seymour's brother. Like most Salinger's work, the most important thing in the narrative is the character's thoughts rather than his actions, words etc. While considering this event, Buddy recreates most of his family's history. And this is a valuable account to those are interested in learn more about the Glasses. So far, sort of a typical Salinger writing. The second part ""Seymour: An Introduction"" is more difficult and problematic to those readers. First thing is that is not an introduction -- at least not our typical introduction. First off, because the reader is already familiar with Seymour, from ""Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters"", or from ""A Perfect Day the Bananafish"" (from ""Nine Stories"", which happens to be paradoxical, since the short story tells an event that happens later on in the character's life).Buddy who describes his older brother -- who he happens to admire-- again narrates the story. The narrative this time round is like a labyrinth rather than a roller coaster. The images are formed without a correlation, the narrator jumps from topic to topic making the understanding of his words rather difficult. Those who are interested in only one Seymour story should go straight to ""A Perfect day for Bananafish"". It is short, but you'll learn a lot about the character -- actually almost everything you need to know is there. Those who like Salinger and his Glass family, are welcome to read ""Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction"", but be advised that it is different (not bad, just different) from what you've read from him, about them.

"Growing up, this was an acceptable alternative to no new Star Trek episodes. The stories were minimal and somewaht juvenile, but thats part of their appeal. The print adaptations were expertly done by Alan Dean Foster and were much better in terms of quality.

I highly recommend this book if you are at the beginning of a decision to pursue a healthier lifestyle.

"Zane Grey: His Life, His Adventures, His Women is a superbly integrated account of one of America's most popular authors of the western novel. Soundly documented and a seminal piece of biographical scholarship by Thomas H. Pauly (Professor of English, University of Delaware) fans of Zane Grey will learn that he was a disappointed aspirant to major league baseball, an unhappy dentist, and took up writing at the age of thirty. His personal life was as colorful as any of his novels which made him the most successful American author of the 1920s, a popularizer of hunting and fishing, an early conservationist and wilderness protection advocate, and a significant figure in the early development of the film industry. He became a world traveler and a man whose marriage was critical to his literary success. But his domestic relationship was stressed by long separations, deep depressions, and multiple affairs with women. Enthusiastically recommended reading, Zane Grey is an impressive biography of a complicated and multifaceted man that is as engaging and entertaining as it is informed and informative.",1

"Ramesh S. Balsekar is still a young student of Self discovery at the time of these conversations.  This book is the result of westeners longing for Ramana Maharshi and Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj.  Mr. Balsekar's thought is not well enough developed to be placed in a book and presented to the public, especially at a cost.  Mr. Balsekar spoke of not being a parrot of his guru, well being a parrot would have made a better book and perhaps helped lead him to the understanding that it is I that AM and it cannot be any other way.  A rose is a rose - is a rose.  Awareness is Awareness and it parrots itself through illusive expressions(Ramana, Maharshi,Me).  If a guru helps you to understand that the color of grass is green, what else can you say about the color of grass otherthan to parrot the guru and say that it is green.  Awareness cannot be different from Awareness. ",1
"An epic story that could have used a better title.  I had heard nothing about this picture when I rented it (or at least don't remember hearing anything).  Excellent settings and scenery.  Superb character development.  Although seeing Ralph Fiennes keep being reincarnated from generation to generation gets somewhat tedious.  He does a very good acting job with it none the less.  This was an amazing story of several generations of one Jewish family in Hungary.  I would compare it to The Pianist or Dr. Zhivago.  A five star movie that should have been promoted more.  The title was inappropriate no matter how fitting it was to the family name or the theme.  I only wish producers would weigh a title more before following thru with it.  The family name's actual spelling would have fit it better.  Or, something else.  I must see movie worth owning.  Sometimes the lust and power get to be a little much but I wouldn't hold it against this masterpiece.  I do agree that this movie could have made as two or three seperate movies. ",0
"I picked this book up while going through RCIA.  I couldn't put it down.  It literally opened my eyes up to understanding Scripture in ways I never imagined.  I learned a lot about the mass, particularly the eucharist, and how it fits in to the whole divine economy.  I also have a better grasp on the book of Revelation.  Scott Hahn is a great author and teacher.  I would have to say this is one of his best.  It helped me understand the Church.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in Scripture, in learning more about what the Catholic Church teaches, and even for those who don't agree with the Catholic Church.  It will answer many of your questions and give you ideas for your own research",1
"i recently have been in grunge denial simply because my music tastes no longer find it appealing, but moreso a dead,sophmoric and depressing genre that inspired many of the nu-emo bands as well as trailer park trash like korn and puddle of mudd.needless to say, soundgardens and smashing pumkins are a whole world apart from your nirvanas, alice in chains, pearl jams, STPs, etc etc.......i would call soundgarden more of a band that is zeppelin influenced rock mixed with some psychedelia and outright crazieness...if they do have any angst, it is projected moreso as obscure questions and deep entrancing mind trips....lets face it, alice in chains and nirvana are easy to grow out of....about as easy as green day is to. so basically, this album is great for punk, industrial, classic rock, and your grunge fans...i mean it really is a sublime experience listening to superunknown...as is badmotorfinger..down on the upside is average......also a noteworthy band is smashing pumpkins. screw alice in chains, nirvana, etc...this is true!..i mean even johnny cash covered them...and they were on the indie label SST...what more could prove this bands greatness",0
"I have had this vacuum for about one month. It replaced the top rated Consumer Report Electrolux (Eureka) that up until now had been the best cleaning vacuum I had ever owned. The Electrolux was heavy and cumbersome so I decided to give Dyson a try. I tried a DC14 vs a DC17 and without a doubt the DC17 out cleaned the DC14. Although more expensive, the DC17 has several more accessories and a carpet cleaning kit included.PROS:   - Unbelievable cleaning; it's true what the other reviews say about the dirt, grit, lint, etc. that comes out of what appears to have been a clean carpet.  - Very easy to maneuver; it's almost like a self propelled vacuum.  - Quality fit and finish; it fits together perfectly and is well finished unlike my previous Electrolux.  - Relatively quiet for such a powerful machine.  - Easy to empty dust container that minimizes escaping dust when it is emptied; I empty it in the toilet which further eliminates any escaping dust but make sure that there is nothing to clog the toilet.  - 5 Year Warranty.CONS:  - Cord has to be wound manually; it should have an automatic rewind.  - Clear plastic covering the brush bar; I assume that the clear plastic is so you can see any obstructions, hair, etc. that might jam the brush. This appears to be the trend in vacuums but I would rather not see the brush and dirt. I liked that about the DC14.  - Slightly heavier than the DC14 but weighs much less than my previous Electrolux.For the ultimate in cleaning Dyson and the DC17 in particular is the vacuum to buy. I don't know what tests they run but Consumer Report is off on this one based on my experience",0
"I ordered the loose tea in tins and received 6 boxes of tea bags. The only labeling on the box was a barcode sticker with for tea in tins, which was incorrect. When calling customer service I had only two options -- return the tea bags or keep them and be overcharged. There was no follow up, so there was no way to know if I would receive the correct product if I ordered again. The price had gone up 20% in the mean time. Rather than be without tea (I can't buy that brand where I live), I kept it. You can't get your money back if you are over charged, and you can't complain about it to anyone who cares. I will never use Amazon Grocery again if I can help it, and I suggest you do the same.",0
"There have been dozens of movies and television shows that capitalize on the legend of Robin Hood.  This version is clever and funny, and the music of country music legend Roger Miller makes this movie one for everyone to watch.Everyone knows the tale of Robin Hood.  Forced to be an outlaw, though always loyal to King Richard, Robin Hood fought against the usurper Prince John.  Robin Hood sheltered and protected poor people and redistributed wealth from the rich to the needy poor.  Robin Hood performed these deeds from his base in Sherwood Forest.Though we have seen this movie with many different great actors, this version has excellent comedy and very good animation.  Robin Hood is appropriately swashbuckling and handsome, and Maid Marian is beautiful; both characters are drawn as foxes.  In fact, all the characters in this movie are animals, as Alan-A-Dale points out at the beginning of the movie.This film has its share of great actors.  Englishman Brian Bedford provides a perfect voice for Robin.  Monica Evans, who also appeared in ""The Odd Couple,"" voices Maid Marian.  The role of Maid Marian was the last for Monica Evans.  The incomparable Peter Ustinov (""Quo Vadis,"" ""Blackbeard's Ghost"") voices both Prince John and King Richard.  Terry Thomas (""Tom Thumb,"" ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes"") is the voice of Sir Hiss.  Roger Miller is the minstrel Alan-A-Dale.  Miller also provided the songs for this movie.  Andy Devine (who had more than 180 movie and television appearances dating back to the 1920's) voices Friar Tuck.  Pat Buttram (""The Rescuers,"" ""Back to the Future III"") voices the Sheriff of Nottingham and George Lindsey (""The Rescuers,"" ""The Andy Griffith Show"") voices Trigger.This movie is fun to watch again and again, and is a favorite of children of all ages.  I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a pleasant story to watch, and to anyone with young children.Enjoy!",0
"The first time I encountered 'Thinkertoys' it was actually the first edition released during the early 90's, when it was also about the time I began to explore the various options with regard to my mid-life transition. In fact, I had initially spotted an interesting review in the Entrepreneur magazine. I managed to trace the publisher & had immediately ordered the first 100 copies for my debut bookstore. It became the best seller in my store for many years. Then came 'Cracking Creativity' a few years later as well as the accompanying brainstorming card deck, Thinkpak, to 'Thinkertoys'. What impressed me most is not so much the creativity tools outlined in both books. In fact, the most productive learning experiences I got out of both books are a few very important things, which I would like to share with readers. Let's take a look at Thinkertoys. In the Introduction, the author started off with a visual puzzle: 'Can you identify the figure below?' Only by shifting your focus, you can then see the hidden word within the figure. In the author's own words, ""...by changing your perspectives, you can expand your possibilities..."" Let's move to 'Cracking Creativity'. In the Introduction, the author introduced a simple arithmetic equation: What is half of thirteen? The subsequent passages as outlined in Part I: Seeing What No One else in Seeing, & Strategy I: Knowing How to See, by the author revealed the secrets to getting many possible answers (or perspectives) to the above equation. No creativity tool outlined in the above two books (or elsewhere in the world, for that matter) can help you to become more creative until you fully understand - & appreciate - what the author is trying to drive home in his two books. In a nut shell, it basically boils down to one important thing: Use - & enhance - your power of vision! or power of observation! The author may not be the first person to postulate this crucial aspect of creativity. I would consider Leonardo da Vinci to be the first person to have understood & practised it religiously. He said, among a few other things, LEARN TO SEE THE WORLD. In fact, he put a lot of emphasis on using your senses, especially your sense of sight. Edward de Bono had also broached this valuable concept in his groundbreaking series of lateral thinking books, starting with 'Mechanism of Mind' in the 70's. I have always believed that you can't do things differently until you can see things differently. Learning to see the world anew & from different perspectives is imperative if one wants to be more creative. According to de Bono, creativity starts at the perceptual stage of thinking. He terms it, First Order Thinking. He added very beautifully: ""This is where our perceptions & concepts are formed, & this is where they have to be changed. Most of the mistakes in thinking are inadequacies of perception rather than mistakes of logic."" The creativity tools, whether they are from the author's books or elsewhere, will then automaticlaly fall into place & make more sense when you have first exercised your power of vision or observation. Using any tool is a piece of cake, but changing one's perception - & maintaining fluidity of perception as well as having multiple perceptions - takes concerted efforts. It is also important to take note that when things (or tactics) don't seem to work out as planned, always remember to check out your observations of the world first. Simply ask: - what do you CHOOSE to see? - where do you DIRECT your attention? The second most productive learning experience I got from the above two books is realising that all thoughts are simply feats of association &/or juxtapositions - & the crux of creativity (in fact, also learning) are making associations &/or juxtapositions. [Tom Peters, in his wonderful book, Liberation Management, drives home with this insightful nugget: ""The essence of creation - in all endeavours - is chance connections between ideas and facts that are previously segregated. Entrepreneurship is the direct by-product of chance, of convoluted connections among ideas, needs and people."" According to Leonardo da vinci, everything is connected to everything else. My question: CAN YOU SEE IT?] The creativity tools outlined by the author are specifically designed for this purpose.The third most productive learning experience for me is understanding the differential between productive & reproductive thinking. To paraphrase the author: ""...in productive thinking, one generates as many alternative approaches as one can, considering the least as well as the most likely approaches...in contrast, reproductive thinking fosters rigidity of thought..."" More relevant aspects about the significance of & more specific strategies to develop productive thinking are excellently covered by the author in 'Cracking Creativity'.To end this review, & in the light of what I have written, I would consider the author's two books as the dynamic duo...to be among the best in the genre!

"Let's get this out of the way first: horrible, god-awful title!  It screams that an amatuer wrote it.  It belongs to some ""self-published"" book you find at the ComicCon, sold in a booth decorated by construction paper and duct tape.   Awful, awful title.But the book is amazing.  In an age where pop culture sometimes becomes a plot in itself, Faust weaves science fiction and world mythology together in a highly entertaining, vividly stylized, and entirely engaging manner.   The characters are real, flesh and blood people who happen to fall into Sci-Fi genres.  This is an accomplishment, since it would have been easy for Faust to just render his people as stereotypes or cardboard cut-outs you'd find trumpeting in dim-lit Sit-Com.   The allusions work, not just as clever refences but they also depict the emotional topography of the story.   At the end of the novel, I actually was caring about both hero and villain.  As a side note, he got Edmonton right.  I live 3 1/2 hours north of this grand city and it was neat to see Edmonton, one of the characters of the novel, depicted well.   Check it out!",1

"I just finished reading Happiness: A History. This was a very interesting read, and a very informative one.In summary,  McMahon takes us on a philosophical review of happiness, starting with Socrates, and taking us up to modern times. Along the way, we read the opinions of such notable figures as Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Napolean, Locke, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, Adam Smith, Hume, Mill, Weber, Schopenhauer, Hegel, Marx, Darwin, Nietzsche, Freud...to name a few.I particularly liked the last part of the book, with McMahon pointing out the relevance of Huxley's Brave New World in our own world today. We are a culture that feels happiness is our right, and the search for it extends to recent advances in pharmacology.  In reading this book you will learn about all the various theories and definitions of ""happiness,"" and how each era dealt with it differently. This book is very well researched and presented.I do have to tell you, Happiness: A History, can be pretty depressing, and there are many parts of the book that are downright bleak. (In an existential kind of way, at least for me.)Still, highly recommended for those interested in the subject, and for anyone who wants to get a good overview of philosophy through the ages.",1

"Craig Gay has penned one of the most penetrating analyses of the mutual reciprocity involved in the interplay between faith and culture. He is especially astute in delineating the subtle effects popular culture has on faith and practice.  Even though he analyzes the faith-culture milieu through the lens of Christianity, many of the conclusions he makes are valid whenever faith clashes with the tidal wave of culture, such as we have in the West.  This book is the total package, as the author makes suggestions concerning what correctives are needed in order to draw people of faith back from the shores of practical atheism.  Of course, these suggestions are consistent with the Christian suppositions he employs throughout.  Gay is very thorough in his examination of the instruments-sociology, psychology, theology, anthropology, epistemology, and others- which pop culture has co-opted so deftly in the process of trivializing faith's role in our lives.  If you liked Richard Weaver's ""Ideas Have Consequences"" or Kenneth Myers' ""All God's Children and Blue Suede Shoes"", you will like this book.  Tolle Lege",1

"This is book 2 of the Graham family series.  Before reading this book, be sure to read ""Come the Morning.""  These books are the best written romance stories of the Scottish vs. English war that I have ever read.  They are more than pin cushion romance.  They draw you into the desperate struggle for Scotland's freedom.  These stories stay with you long after you finish them.My personal suggestion for reading this series:Each book picks up where the last left off.  You are given a realistic view of the devastating war between England and Scotland.  The Graham men are Scottish, fighting for their freedom.  The heroines in these stories are English.  I have read the first three books so far, and each one has the couples paired that way.In order to enjoy each book, without feeling the themes are redundant, I suggest reading a book that is not connected with this series in between each of the Graham series books.  This will make each story stand on it's own, while still keeping you personally connected to the Graham men...  And these books are written well enough that you will feel that personal connection.Conquer the Night:Kyra's beloved father has died.  He has spent his life loyal to the English king, although his estate is in Scotland.  His only heir is his daughter, Kyra.Kyra is devastated.  Not only has she lost her father, but a horrible man has convinced King Edward to give Kyra to him in marriage.  She loathes this man, Kinsey Darrow, and uses her personal connections to Edward to stall the wedding.  As a servant and knight to King Edward, Darrow leaves Kyra's estate temporarily to fight in the war.  When he returns, he finds that the castle has been overtaken by the Scots.  When he hears it is Aaryn Graham who has taken the castle, he knows that Graham will have taken his betrothed as well.  He is certain Aaryn will use her as revenge for the fact that Darrow had raped and murdered Aaryn's young pregnant wife a year earlier.Aaryn feels triumphant.  Revenge will finally be his!  He has taken the castle that Darrow hoped to claim through marriage, and he has taken Darrow's betrothed prisoner.  He plans to ruin her by taking her virtue.  He is certain Lady Kyra encouraged the ravishment of his wife and home.While bathing in the master chamber, which is the room he keeps Kyra in, she thinks she can convince him that using her would be worthless.  She taunts him with stories of how ""well used"" she already is.  She claims to have been with every stable boy, servant, and knight in the keep.  When Aaryn has had all he can take of her words, he quickly grabs her and takes her himself.  When he does, he stops immediately.  He finds that she had lied about being experienced.  Still, she is hard to resist.  Aaryn finds it becomes more and more difficult to keep her out of his thoughts.Over the next weeks, Aaryn is surprised to find how happy the people of Kyra's land are to have him there.  They believe he was sent by God to save her from her marriage to Darrow.  Aaryn trains the people daily, preparing them for Darrow's return.  They must fight the English soldiers to keep Kyra free of Darrow.  They have realized that Darrow will murder Kyra once he has married her to claim her title and home. Aaryn can't stay in Kyra's land forever.  He must return to the battle with England.  One of the greatest battles in this wars history is about to take place.  He must be there to fight for Scotland.  However, he can't leave Kyra alone.  He knows Darrow will capture her and kill her.  Aaryn brings Kyra along, planning to hide her with the wives of the Scottish soldiers.Who will win the battle for Scotland's freedom?  (The outcome is based upon true facts of the war.)  Will Darrow find Kyra?  Will Aaryn be slain in the combat against England?There is a traitor among Kyra's people.  Who is it?  How will he betray her?  Read and find out.There are 5 books in this series.  Reading them in order does make a difference.  Here is the order of the series:Come the MorningConquer the NightSeize the DawnKnight TriumphantThe Lion in GloryI am yet to have read the last two, but I have ordered them from Amazon.  I look forward to the continuing story of the Graham family",1
"For me, William Styron has written the standard from which to draw the historical novel. I say draw because an historical novel is just that; a novel. But even while the reader knows this, historical novels always seem to provoke some response framed by the light of a current outlook. This is ironic because the main attraction of historical novels (at least for me) is the escapist type pleasure that is found by immersing oneself in another world and time. This is the writer's accomplishment. William Styron does this in language and in pace so artfully that his book remains on my shelf. I keep 'The Confessions of Nat Turner' for its enjoyment and inspiration",1

"The late Janet Arnold can certainly be called the mother of historical accuracy in costume research. Her meticulous sketches of extant garments, coupled with her carefully drawn graphed patterns, make her books indispensible both for students of historical costumes and for those who wish to reproduce them. Each drawing includes a brief description of the garment, including which materials were used and any types of embellishment. I found it very easy to scale up the patterns I wanted to use with one-inch pattern graphing paper (available through most fabric outlets). This particular volume in the _Patterns of Fashion_ series includes my favorite era -- the English Regency. The patterns provided include long gowns, a crossover bodice shortgown (a version of which was made for Kate Winslet in &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;), a riding habit and a 1790s pelisse (overdress). This book is worth every penny and will become a dog-eared favorite on your costuming shelf",1

"This book is really different from Bramley's first except in his courage to talk about evidence that many people won't.  It is an exhaustive encyclopedia of Jesus Theories that I enjoyed on many levels, and it was far more comprehensive than I expected.  Bramley presents all of the theories, not just the ones he believes in, and he has insights about Jesus that I've never read before.  Some of the theories can be shocking, but Bramley takes the time to document everything. I think that the title and packaging of this book does it a disservice.  Although the title is clever with a nice cover, this is a serious book with university-level scholarship.  It's the kind of book you expect to find in libraries and assigned to college students.  I give it two thumbs way up. ",1

"I'm probably the only person in the world who hadn't read a Stephen King novel, and am so glad that I started with this one which is a writing gem. Dolores Claiborne is a plain woman who has had to work hard all of her life to support herself, her three children and her violent, lazy, drunken sot of a husband.The entire book is Dolores' narrative to the police chief and a police stenographer, with only her words being recorded. She had worked as housekeeper to a wealthy old woman, a recluse who became more and more difficult as she aged, so Dolores' work and caring for her children was her entire world. I found this slim book to be a marvel of pithy condensation, without a wasted word and well able to tell a life story of great drama and to hold the reader's attention for a good one day read",1

I know of no other book which really attempts to cover the vernacular tradition cooking in England (though there are several historic recipe collections).

I read this book to my children when they were growing up so many times I can almost recite it from memory.

"What is so unusual and valuable about this book is that it represents a prolonged experiment in inventing fresh ways to express metaphysical ideas in English prose and poetry. Most philosophers are poor prose stylists and most prose stylists steer clear of weighty metaphysics. But in this book we find a passionate, inventive prose stylist deeply engaged with pondering such topics as the One and the Many, substance and the composite nature of objects, time and space, the relation of thought and perception to reality, the nature of desire and happiness, mortality and immortality. He approaches these topics through a starting point in Buddhism but going wherever his mind takes him. The book contains many gems of expression as Kerouac pours his ponderings into his strange, striking prose. To criticize this book because Kerouac's scholarship is weak is to miss its point",1

Helps us all understand what the opposite sex feels and thinks about. It also includes lots of erotic-but-not-explicit pics that can be a turn-on just for themselves",1
You will be better off doing a search on the net.  I will say this positive about the book...it proves anything can actually get published.  If you spend a couple of hours on the net you could write a better book..,1
"This book is a must read for people familiar with the Buddhist path.  It provides a general framework for how all the different practices and teachings fit, in relation to one another and the Buddhist path more generally.  In response to some of the critiques of the book below, the book must be taken within its historical context.  Tibet was a patriarchial culture and Tsong-kha-pa did see Buddhism as a superior path to other paths.  That said, Tsong-kha-pa's comments on these things need to be taken with a grain of salt and it is much better to look to current teachers, such as the Dalai Lama, for advice on these topics",1
"Carolyn Cooper continues to be the most insightful thinker writing on the implications of Jamaican dancehall culture for the politics of gender and globalization.  While Cooper focuses heavily on local Caribbean dancehall in her book, she weaves a narrative applicable to political theory and cultural studies internationally.  Cooper is a folk philosopher who has been at the center of much heated debates over the last decade due to her position privileging folk life and Jamaican indigenous language--patois--over high brow theory.  Cooper did not need Immanuel Kant to know that articulating the gulf between theory and practice many times revolves around disputes over competing political languages.  Cooper and Kant converge insofar as they each attempt to develop universal laws of culture, of which some elements are a priori and others specific to the realm of experience.Cooper's 1989-1990 JAMAICA JOURNAL essay ""Slackness Hiding from Culture: Erotic Play in the Dancehall"" was the first scholarly analysis of Jamaican dancehall culture.  Since the publication of that essay, an explosion in literature on dancehall ensued.  Cooper expanded the central argument of that essay into a book released a few years later entitled NOISES IN THE BLOOD.  Cooper's current text under review, SOUND CLASH (2004), is an investigation into Jamaican dancehall culture at large.  To study local Jamaican dancehall is to study dancehall's impact outside the island.  Hence, Cooper devotes the latter third of the text to dancehall in places such as Barbados and Great Britain.  Nevertheless, a majority of the work deals with interrogations into the lyrics of key musical figures in Jamaican dancehall including Ninjaman, Lady Saw, Capelton, Buju Banton, and Anthony B, and the ways in which those figures reflect wider concepts of the self, gender relations, power, and freedom.The notion of ""slackness"" serves as an overarching subtext throughout.  The chapter on Lady Saw is quite simply a must read, as are chapter 2 comparing the classical reggae lyrics of Bob Marley to the dancehall DJ Shabba Ranks and chapter 9 explicating dancehall in the South Asian Diaspora via the rhymes of British DJ Apache Indian (born Steve Kapur).  Lady Saw in particular has been maligned by Jamaican bourgeois society much the same way that heretical European women had been marginalized by men historically in their respective cultures.  Yet Lady Saw is the ultimate folk philosopher who has managed to use her lyrical prowess to destabilize conventional notions of womanhood, thus transform our understanding of concepts through the epistemological slackness she wields.  As Cooper observes, ""Lady Saw's brilliant lyrics, reinforced by her compelling body language, articulate a potent message about sexuality, gender politics, and the power struggle for the right to public space in Jamaica...It encompasses the cunning strategies that are employed by outspoken women like Lady Saw who speak subtle truths about their society"" (p. 123).Cooper devotes time in the Introduction to rebutting criticisms leveled against her by other dancehall commentators, one of whom is Norman Stolzoff.  Stolzoff is the author of another seminal text on Jamaican dancehall, WAKE THE TOWN AND TELL THE PEOPLE (2000)--a book that I suggest readers interested in Cooper's work should also consult.  Wherever you stand on the debates between Cooper and her critics, you must take those conversations as a healthy indicator of the increased awareness about dancehall and the reality that the principles of those living dancehall inside and outside Jamaica offer their own notions of universalism.  In closing, I highly recommend SOUND CLASH to all those seeking to understand how a cultural form of life can indeed change the very way we view politics, theory, the world, and ourselves",1

"True Believer has to be one of the best movies ever made. The evidence I introduce to support my case is I have watched it 7-8 times without becoming remotely tired of it. (Raiders of the Lost Ark, another favorite of mine, got a little tedious after 3 viewings). True Believer is James Woods at his very best. The story is very plausible and the clues unravel at a perfect pace throughout the film. In fact, the movie gives you the opportunity to piece the puzzle together as the characters do. Robert Downey Jr., is the perfect naive &quot;sidekick&quot; to James Woods cynical been-through-the-grinder attorney. Kurtwood Smith is perfect as the district attorney. If you are a James Woods fan and haven't seen this movie you are in for a treat. Buy it",0

"""This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with a new meaning, 'My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.' ""And if America is to be a great nation this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!""Let freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado!""Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California!""But not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!""Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee!""Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring...""--Martin Luther King, Jr., August 28, 1963  Dr. King must surely have had a thought or two of Marian Anderson as he stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on that historic afternoon and delivered those words. Many of us know Marian's basic story:  Marian Anderson was a helluva singer. Despite being celebrated in Europe as the voice of a century, and despite having the strong support of the President's wife, Eleanor Roosevelt, Marian Anderson was denied the opportunity to perform in Constitution Hall in Washington, DC because it was owned by the Daughters of the American Revolution, and those ladies didn't allow no black folks to be singing in their hall.  That refusal led to Marian performing instead from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial for a crowd of 75,000 people on the Mall and a nationwide radio audience.   She stood up tall where Martin would stand a quarter-century later and led off her performance with a rendition of My County 'Tis of Thee.   Her performance is seen as a historic event at the dawn of the modern Civil Rights movement. Two years ago, Pam Munoz Ryan and Brian Selznick created the stunningly beautiful 40 page picture book, WHEN MARIAN SANG (Scholastic Press, 2002), which won all sorts of awards including a Sibert Honor. Now Russell Freedman has written a beautiful and more detailed biography of Marian Anderson which will similarly captivate readers with its engaging text and its clear, oversized photographs of the singer herself and of supporting characters in the story of Marian Anderson. The most precious of those supporters were also some of the earliest.  Through the chapters focusing on her earliest years, I was moved by Freedman's portrayal of how Marian's childhood community came through time and time again to insure that her dreams would not be in vain: ""Again there was no money for lessons.  Most of Marian's earnings from concert appearances went to her mother, who was still taking in laundry and scrubbing floors, and to her sisters, who were still in school.  And again the congregation at Union Baptist Church came to Marian's aid, organizing a benefit concert that raised $566 so that she could study with Boghetti."" Equally moving is the subplot of her life that involves Orpheus Fisher: ""I don't wanna wait in vain for your love""  --Bob Marley Having had to quit school after eighth grade in the wake of her father's death, Marian did not complete high school until she was twenty-four.  It was during her delayed high school years--back when America was engaged in the First World War--that Marian met Orpheus Fisher who, ""like her, was still in high school.  He fell for the shy singer with the soft laughter and huge sparkling eyes who was almost as tall as he...""   Decades later, America was midway through the Second World War when Marian finally relented and married Orpheus, who has tirelessly and faithfully pursued her all those years, while she was single-mindedly focused on her career. And what a career it was: ""During one ten-month period she gave 123 concerts in fifteen different countries, performing a repertoire that included over two hundred songs and arias in German, Italian, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Finnish, and other languages."" It must have been amazingly disheartening for Marian Anderson to return home from entertaining European royalty and once again come face to face with Jim Crow.  Like black sports stars of that era, Marian faced dangerous and humiliating conditions when traveling and performing around some regions of our ""sweet land of liberty.""  And yet, in photos, she appears both to have left that all behind and to be channeling some kind of higher power as she sings. "" 'It was music-making that probed too deep for words.' "" Marian Anderson remains a symbol of the historic fight to let freedom ring for all Americans.  In VOICE THAT CHALLENGED A NATION, Russell Freedman goes far beyond the symbolic to provide us a memorable look at the life of a singer whose talents knew no bounds. ",1

"I was required to read ""Love Letters"" for an American drama class I took, and I fell in love with it.  The entire play is just Andy and Melissa reading letters they have written to each other throughout their lives, but it still packs a dramatic ""punch"".  Gurney loves to critisize WASP culture in his plays, but I was more involved in the love story.  Andy and Melissa are two people who want to be together, but can't.  All of the letters were wonderful.  At times they were funny while others were very touching.  The end of the play is the most heartfelt, tear-inducing scene I have ever read in both drama and regular prose.  It's a short play; it'll take less than hour to read.  Just read it.  I promise you won't be disappointed",1
"This is the only Dark Tranquillity album that I own, but from the reviews I have read and the quality of the album it is reasonable to think that Damage Done is the best of Dark Tranquillity.

"They were one of Hollywood's all-time legendary couples, both on screen and off; producing celluloid magic in the four films they made together between 1943 and 1948 as much as by their off-screen romance, which in itself was the stuff that dreams are made of. He was the American Film Insititute's No. 1 star of the 20th century, Hollywood's original noir anti-hero, who in addition to the AFI honors bestowed on his real-life persona also played two of the 20th century's Top 50 film heroes (""Casablanca""'Rick Blaine and this movie's Philip Marlow); epitome of the handsome, cynical and oh-so lonesome wolf, looking unbeatably cool in dinner jacket, trenchcoat and fedora alike, a glass of whiskey in his hand and cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth; and endowed with a legendary aura several times larger than his physical stature. She, despite a 25-year age difference his equal in everything from grit and toughness to mysterious appeal; chillier than bourbon on the rocks, possessing more than just a touch of class whatever her role; and long since a bona fide AFI movie legend in her own right.Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall met on the set of Howard Hawks's 1944 realization of Ernest Hemingway's ""To Have and Have Not,"" where an obvious chemistry quickly developed between 45-year-old veteran Bogart, who had just scored two of film history's greatest-ever hits with ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Casablanca"" in the two preceding years, and the sassy, exciting 20-year-old newcomer who possessed the maturity and sex-appeal of a woman good and well 10 years her senior. They were reunited two years later for this adaptation of Raymond Chandler's first Philip Marlowe novel ""The Big Sleep"" (1939), based on a screenplay written, like that of ""To Have and Have Not,"" by William Faulkner and Jules Furthman, together with Leigh Brackett (who had not participated in scripting the Hemingway adaptation). By the time the movie was released in 1946, Bogart and Bacall were married.Reprising Bogart's noir gumshoe role with a character not unlike Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade in ""The Maltese Falcon,"" the movie ""The Big Sleep"" is as infamous as Chandler's literary original for its labyrinthine plot, which reportedly even the author himself couldn't completely untangle (nor did he care to). The plot is essentially faithful to Chandler's novel, from which it takes much of its dialogue; albeit streamlined and with some changes made to fit Bogart's physical characteristics, and eliminating or softening a few scenes considered unfit for display to a moviegoing audience in the 1940s. The story begins when Marlowe is hired by wealthy old General Sternwood to handle a blackmailing attempt involving gambling debts incurred by Sternwood's younger daughter Carmen (Martha Vickers) (whom the detective has already met when she literally threw herself into his arms upon his entry into the house, sucking her thumb and coyly telling him ""you're cute""). After his interview with the dying general in the latter's hot and humid orchid house, a disheveled Marlowe is summoned to the rooms of the general's older daughter Vivian (Lauren Bacall), who tries to worm out of him the purpose of his engagement and who, as Marlowe quickly concludes, has more than a minor hidden agenda of her own. Soon the detective is up to his ears in the classical film noir brew of murder, damsels in distress, shady characters and a world where nothing is what it appears to be, and where he'll be able to consider himself lucky if he gets out alive -- yet, he is determined to see the case through and will neither be bought off by money nor by sweetness and seduction.Looking back at the movie and its stars' almost mythical fame, it is difficult to imagine that, produced at the height of the studio system era, it was originally just one of the roughly 50 movies released by Warner Brothers over the course of one year. But mass production didn't equal low quality; on the contrary, the great care given to all production values, from script-writing to camera work, editing, score (Max Steiner) and the stars' presentation in the movie itself and in its trailer was at least partly responsible for its lasting success. Indeed, the release of ""The Big Sleep"" was delayed for an entire year - and not only because its first version was completed around the end of WWII and Warner Brothers wanted to get their still-unreleased war movies into theaters first, but also, and significantly, because Lauren Bacall's agent convinced studio boss Jack Warner and director Howard Hawks to reshoot several scenes to better highlight the sassy, mysterious new star Bacall had become after ""To Have and Have Not."" And it certainly paid off: ""The Big Sleep"" firmly established then-22-year-old Lauren Bacall as one of Hollywood's new leading ladies, and even more than her first film with Humphrey Bogart laid the foundation for the couple's mythical relationship.Bogart and Bacall would star together two more times after ""The Big Sleep"": In ""Dark Passage"" (1947) and ""Key Largo"" (1948). But of their four collaborations, the first two -- and in particular, ""The Big Sleep"" -- remain unparalleled for their secretive, shadowy aura, tight scripting, snappy dialogue, cynicism and underlying seductiveness; due in equal parts to the story crafted by Raymond Chandler, its adaptation by Faulkner, Furthman and Brackett, Howard Hawks's masterful direction and its starring couple's irresistible chemistry. After three failed marriages, after having produced on-screen magic with Mary Astor in ""The Maltese Falcon"" and, even more so, with Ingrid Bergman in ""Casablanca"" (and although he would go on to star in such memorable pairings as next to Katherine Hepburn in ""The African Queen"" and Audrey Hepburn in ""Sabrina""), Humphrey Bogart had finally met his match -- and while his and Bacall's marriage was painfully cut short by the cancer to which he succumbed in 1957, the magnetism they created on screen will live on, and nowhere more brilliantly than in ""The Big Sleep.",0

"I have not read Twain since High School twenty five plus years ago but a  friend on a newspapers book forums got me to read him again and A Tramp  Abroad is the first book I picked. For the current generation this book may  drag but for those of us who grew up reading books instead of playing  computer games this is Twain at his best. One has to actually read into his  writing to appreciate a lot of the irony but when this book is really on  like the mountain climbing near the Matterhorn ,Twain makes Seinfeld seem  like he's talking about something.

"""Homophone"" was originally the name of a record label inaugurated in 1905, its first release being a disc by the Wagnerian tenor Ernest van Dyck. At this time Van Dyck was far past his prime, and Gregor Benko continues this tradition (that of ""singers in decline"") with his new incarnation of the Homophone name.""The Muse Surmounted"", Homophone's first offering, is an uproariously funny excursion into what I would label ""mal canto"". Each singer in this collection set her own substandard for vocal art, and each one is presented in transfers that allow the holes in one's technique to shine through. Brightly.The disc opens with an ""overture"" of sorts, a ""Carmen"" potpourri by the original Homophone Orchestra. If you like your Bizet with slap-tongued baritone saxophones and your Toreadors to boast to a fox-trot beat, this one's for you.Next in line is a certain Rosalina Mello, in a ""fado portugues"" that is rendered in a tone reminiscent of a cat in heat. She also approaches several high A's in this piece with a long-discarded vocal technique known as ""portamentissimo"". Better put Garfield outside before giving Mme. Mello a listen.Next we encounter Alice Gerstl Duschak, a long-time teacher at Baltimore's Peabody Conservatory. Benko's (excellent, I might add) program notes state that she was a teacher of Jessye Norman, and I might add that Gerstl Duschak's voice, as represented here, had no sideways.The name Betty-Jo Schramm was hilarious enough for me - before hearing the track, I could picture her in pigtail and poodle skirt. According to Benko, she was a pioneer in the early-music movement, singing the music a half-tone lower than we normally hear it today. However, she failed to cue the orchestra in on her innovation.Tryphosa Bates-Batcheller, another favorite of the producer, cut her precious few discs at the same Melotone studio where her more famous predecessor, Florence Foster Jenkins, sought to perpetuate her art. And what an art it is. She is represented with a Meyer-Helmund song and an American folk song. Edith Helena at 81 sang better than this.My favorite - at least for now - is Natalia de Andrade, a rather interesting character, who imposes upon the role of Manon a rather distinctive tritone tremolo reminiscent of the dearly departed Mrs. Elva Miller. It takes a life of its own, creating a somewhat minimalist rhythmic shift and will cause you to reach for the tequila. Perhaps she already had.Olive Middleton, beloved diva assoluta of the La Puma Opera Workshop, is represented with her beloved ""Miserere"" from ""Trovatore"" her alleged high C ringing rather clearly through the speakers.A lovely surprise was the discovery of Norma-Jean Erdmann-Chadbourne, who is in fact the ""Jenny Williams"" of the Victor ""Faust Travesty"". If you thought her final trio from Faust (sung as a duet) with her partner ""Thomas Burns"" (actually Ellis Chadbourne, listed here as Thomas Garcia - he had to change his name a lot) was simply the living end of opera finales, just you wait until you hear their Tomb Scene from Aida. A certain Sylvia Sawyer, who evidently actually filled in a few mezzo-soprano roles on some early-fifties opera LPs, offers an Aida excerpt (Amneris) that, although shows no gross lapses of pitch, taste, or intonation, is a precious textbook example of bland mediocrity combined with indifferent attention to the peculiars of Italian pronunciation. One wonders if the Capitol label thought to check the Yellow Pages under ""mezzo-sopranos"" when casting for this Aida album.From the lamented Remington label comes the ""Tosca from Hell"", an infamous performance by Vassilka Petrova.Madame Mari Lyn (although the program notes claim that she was a woman, and a widow to boot, I swear I think this person was a drag queen!) gives her special vocal rendition of ""Una voce poco fa"".  [Later research on the part of this writer revealed that she was, in fact, a she.  Mea culpa.]The most disturbing performance on the disc is a 1980 performance by socialite and trophy-wife Sari Bunchuk Wontner, who gave staged performances of ""Traviata"" in her home - with full casts and orchestra. (One hell of a Tupperware party, don't you think?) Of course, art imitates life, and she was Violetta. Secretly taped from a live performance (presumably by a ""former friend""), this first-act scene defies description. She is often several beats ahead of or behind the orchestra, she may be as much as a third off of the key in either direction, and the whole affair sounds as if she had a flask of Cuervo hidden behind each prop. A year after this performance, she fell overboard from her yacht. Perhaps she was rehearsing for a future Tosca.Surely the best-known name included is that of Florence Foster Jenkins, arguably the most famous of the daffier divas. The track, a Cosme McMoon decomposition entitled ""Valse Caressante"", is not included in the Victor reissue of dear Flofojen's legendary Melotone discs; in fact it is not included in the Jenkins discography in the magazine ""The Record Collector"". This rather long affair seems to find the diva, the pianist, and the flautist all on a bad day, with the result being a performance that is cheaper than a home perm and twice as curly on your hair.The last track is a recording of Jenkins' accompanist, Cosme McMoon, reminiscing about his musical life with our dear Flofojen. Benko also clears the air, after careful research, about the ""Cosme McMoon was actually Edwin McArthur"" rumor. Buy the CD to find the answer.This is also a first-class prodution, with attention to quality in presentation.  The program notes alone are worth the price of the CD. Benko has carefully researched these singers, often waiting years for leads to information. In fact, a picture of Natalia de Andrade arrived after the disc went to press, and it is posted on the Homophone website. Our poor Manon looks for all the world like trailer trash showing up for a Jerry Springer taping.Another picture of interest to many will be the penultimate photo - a picture of Cosme McMoon, radiant in a 70s combover, flanked by ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER at the 1974 Mr. Universe Contest, during the time he had given up his music career and was managing a male bordello.This will be The Party Album of the New Millenium.

"I happened upon this book while perusing the shelves at my local library. I was lingering by the ""133.5"" section when its bright-red cover caught my eye. After reading the title, I knew that I would be taking it home. I thumbed through the pages to my own section and that of my partner. I didn't find anything too objectionable, so I checked it out.Unlike a seemingly-similar-and-also-excellent tome, ""Linda Goodman's Love Signs,"" this book does not discuss in length signs in combination with each other. It does, however, give in-depth interpretations of each individual sign with a cursory list of the different combinations for both straight and gay couplings. The format separates men from women so that the nuances of each gender may be better understood.I really like the construction of this book. Each sign/gender has a one-page introduction followed by the subheading ""Sign + Mind."" This first section describes the psychological makeup of its natives, using the cosmology of astrology (polarity, rulership, element, quality, etc.) in association with and represented by mythological and Biblical archetypes. If examples exist, modern literary characters are cited as well.The second section, ""Body + Soul,"" illustrates how the psychology of an individual expresses itself in corporeal form. I do find this section to be less ""on the money,"" because an individual's physical form is highly colored by the Ascendant sign at birth; thus, making morphological generalities based upon sun sign alone somewhat less accurate. If you know your own (or your partner's) rising sign, you can cross-reference the corresponding section for this other sign.The third section, ""Sex + Sexuality,"" addresses the reasons most of us are interested in this book in the first place. It synthesizes the previous two segments in order to tell us how we like it and why. The language is of an adult nature, but this is an adult topic meant for adults, so it is wholly appropriate. I don't have enough experience to know whether all the sexual proclivities are spot-on, but after reading the corresponding ""sign + mind"" divisions, I can see that there is quite a bit of congruence.Throughout the book, there are informative asides for each sign/gender in the margins of the pages -- ""principle,"" ""planetary symbol,"" ""sign quadrant,"" ""sign glyph,"" ""element + quality,"" ""polarity,"" ""sign number,"" ""sign-age association,"" ""psychology,"" ""archetype + myth,"" ""Bible + literature,"" ""keywords for the astrological house,"" ""keywords for the sign,"" ""body rulership,"" ""list of famous people,"" ""straight turn-ons,"" and ""gay turn-ons"" -- which serve as a sort of ""Cliffs' Notes"" for this hefty tome. In fact, the reader can get a heck of a lot out of just reading the margins without ever delving any deeper into the chapters.In summary, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in knowing themselves, and their partners or prospective partners, intimately. You will not be disappointed",1

I've downloaded most of these, but the quality is poor, and I'm looking forward to the crisp, bright quality of the DVDs.I'm curious to know:  Is there some kind of tribute to Phil Hartman on this season?  He did so many great characters, and I think their decision to not recast Troy McClure in his honor was a good one.  I think a look at a great guy, such a shocking loss of a major voice of the cast would be worthy of an ""Extra"" on the discs",0
"I've never been thrilled with conspiracy theories. I love &quot;Proofs&quot; because its author wrote clearly with a style rare in his era. Robison had a direct and uncluttered view of morality and the  importance of events, decisions, and how mens' beliefs affect their  actions. I compare &quot;Proofs Of A Conspiracy&quot; with Burke's  &quot;Reflections of the French Revolution.&quot; Ideas do have  consequences",1
"Though a devout Catholic, I normally find ""Lives of the Saints"" books very dry and alienating.  This book is different.  The author makes the saints he writes about come alive by relating how they have very personally affected his own life.  In many cases he has visited their homes and/or villages, seminaries and convents.  In some cases he has met people who knew the saints.  He includes many modern-day saints, some not yet canonized by the Church.  The book has a strong and warm Jesuit orientation but many lay and clerical people would find this book moving and inspiring.  This book is intellectual but very readable. ",1
"Take the most precious, most beautiful, most amazing experiance you've felt.  Hold it.  Not, magnify that by infinity.  Imagine something that captures the very essence of pure beauty, and turns it into music that inspires, leaves you left in a state of awe, and moves you like nothing you'll ever feel again.  That is Voodoo CHild - The End of Everything.  It is -beyond- words, beyond the ability to describe.  You will never be the same person after hearing this small bit of perfection",0
"Due to the unfortunate breakup of this band, this is the only cd that will ever hit the shelves.  However, this is one hell of a release to be their only one.  The songs are so powerful.  I only wish I could think up lyrics as deep and meaningful as theirs.  The guitars are amazing, relaxing/soothing at times and in your face and hard at others.  TJ's screaming and singing flow perfectly with Cody's singing.  Personal favorites on the album: 2. Love Jealous One, Love, 4. Bloodsucker Pt. 2, 5. Terrible! How Terrible For The Great City!, 6. The Widow, 9. One: TwentySeven and 10. Of Want And Misery: The Nothing That Kills.  The Widow and Of Want And Misery actually get to me emotionally, which is a rarity in music today.  Also, if you get the chance before their breakup in August, the band's live show is amazing. This cd is worth every penny and is going to be a piece of history in this genre alongside Beloved (R.I.P), UnderOath, and the other amazings acts to put their mark on this kind of music.",0

"Having read the vast array of literature on Woody Allen, I must conclude Stig Bjorkman's biography is a must-have for any self-professed Woody Allen fan.  This book is a major page-turner offering great insight on Allen as a director/writer/actor, without disgressing into things (tidbits on his personal life, albeit juicy) that are really of little significance in the understanding and evaluation of this talented and prolific artist",1
"This book won the 2003 World Fantasy Award, and it's easy to see why. There are wonderful stories here by many fine writers, including Charles de Lint, Emma Bull, Midori Snyder, Delia Sherman, Patricia McKillip, Tanith Lee, Jeffrey Ford, and many others, a real Who's Who of the fantasy field. I'm not sure why the reviewers below were surprised that the stories are aimed at teenagers -- this book is a Young Adult anthology, published by Viking Children's Books, so what else did they expect? Nonetheless, there is plenty for adult readers here too, if you love myth, magic, and the timeless concerns of coming-of-age",1
"Casa Mexicana offers stunning photographic portrayals of various periods in the architecture of Mexico, from haciendas to colonial and contemporary architecture.

"I discovered ""I Went Walking"" when I taught first grade.  It was a part of their literature series early in the year.  I have no children of my own and I own both the board book and the paperback edition of this book because I love the illustrations and the rhythmical quality of the text. As someone who has professionally worked with children ages 2-12, I find that this kind of text is invaluable to early readers (ages 2-7).  Children can easily pick up on the patterns in the sentences and begin developing many pre-reading skills (like being able to identify the left to right movement of written sentences).  To find books that your young child will want to read over and over again is a jewel in their literacy development.  To find books like this that you will want to read over and over again with your child is a treasure box of time shared",1

I had been looking for a help book like this for a long time.  It does not bog you down in highly technical stuff",1
"Based on the Alan Hollinghurst novel, the BBC television series ""The Line Of Beauty"" unfolds through the eyes of Nick Guest (Dan Stevens). Nick, a middle class student studying Henry James at Oxford, is invited by his friend Toby Fedden (Oliver Coleman) to stay at his family's posh home in London's Notting Hill. Nick is swept away by the Feddens' prestige and affluence, and as he becomes enamored with the family, he's seduced by money, power, and sex into the moral void that surrounds the Feddens. Ultimately this is a tale of the 80--Thatcher's Britain, the corruption of the wealthy set, racism, homophobia, classism, and the sceptre of AIDS.Gradually Nick is absorbed into the Fedden home and becomes a permanent fixture. Although the Feddens on the surface appear to be a glamourous family, their elegant lifestyle, antique stuffed home, and perfect manners shield a great deal of ugliness. While Nick is ostensibly treated as 'one of the family,' there's always an implication that he has a social role to play. As a personable, unattached gay male, he makes up the difference at dinner parties by escorting single women, and he's also expected to be a caretaker of hostile lithium-plied daughter, Cat (Hayley Atwell). Gerald Fedden (Tim McInnerny) is a prominent Tory M.P. who's slated for a glittering career in the party. Pompous, hard, and ambitious, he hides these traits with a blustery joviality and a true talent to diffuse even the most explosive situation. Mrs. Fedden, Rachel (Alice Krige) is the perfect politician's wife--elegant, poised, but also content to stay in the background, and if there's anything ugly in her life, she copes by ignoring it.While everyone knows Nick is gay, it's a subject that's largely ignored and never discussed. Nick has a relationship with a lower class, bicycle riding black man, Leo (Don Gilet), and also with Wani Ouradi (Alex Wyndam), the Lebanese heir to a gigantic fortune. Wani, like most of the gay men in the Fedden's filthy rich set, is firmly in the closet, and he accepts the fact that he leads a risky double life. With Wani's money and influence, Nick establishes a glossy magazine and even toys with a film script for ""The Spoils of Poynton.""Nick is an amazingly hollow character, and it's no accident that he's a Henry James scholar. Nick, as the outside observer of the wealthy set, is the perfect Jamesian character. As a hanger on of the smug, self-satisfied filthy rich, he's half in love with the power and affluence of the upper crust, and he's also an observer of their troubling, tainted and poisoned morality. One of James's themes is that love is often in competition with power and aesthetic beauty. In ""The Line of Beauty"" power is the overriding element in all relationships, and this is something Nick--a class outsider--fails to realize until the very end. Directed by Saul Dibb, with a spectacular cast, stellar acting, and marvelous sets, ""The Line of Beauty"" exceeded my expectations. While on one level, it explores Nick's moral dilemma as he navigates life with the decadent, rich and powerful set, on another level, the plot is heavily influenced by the master, Henry James. It was delightful for this James fan to drink in the themes and the moral dilemma of Nick--a man who basically knows he should make a moral stand but subsumes his morality to the affluence and power of those who use him--and in some cases--even despise him--displacedhuma",0
The book has one decent idea.  Everything else you could pay a dollar and get it all off ebay.  Nothing really special about book,1
"Jacobo Timerman has written a gripping and terrifying account of his experiences at the mercy of Argentina's Peronist regime of the late 70's.  A well respected, professional journalist in Buenos Aires, he was editor of the major newspaper La Opinión until he was kidnapped by the military for publishing articles critical of their terrorist tactics.  He details how as a political prisoner, and more signifigantly as a Jew, he was held and tortured by a military carried away by their own delusions and rationalizations of violence - and by their virulent anti-semitism.  Timerman displays a penetrating insight into the mindset of his captors and of a society that tried to ignore what was happening.  A must read",1
"This is an hilarious motion picture.  The cast is marvelous.  Jamie Lee Curtis is outstanding, as is Kevin Kline.  John Cleese does a masterful job as a stuffy, English barrister.

"This is the most definative presentation of all the Kennedy Assasination materials availble for review. By far the most factual. When all eyewitnesses are interviewed and all the Doctors at Parkland and all the eyewitnesses at the autopsy are heard, there leaves little doubt to the conclusion. There's no fluff just fact. I own all other presentations and the Peter Jennings presentation is on the other end of this spectrum. The 3D animation is so ridicolous and unaccurate relative to the Zappruder Film I can't believe it and neither should you. A cartoon which never accounts for the 3rd bullet hitting the President in the back as shown on Zappruder Film and no interviews with the Parkland Doctors or Bethesda Staff of x-ray teams who say "" That's not the x-rays we took."" What kind of reporting is that. John Kennedy has been dead a long,long time now and the events that occured the day he died are more than just a compelling story. It's hard, or mabey not so hard, to believe that a grand conspiricy took place because Kennedy had an agenda that did not set well with many people from many powerful places inside and outside government. The mission was accomplished. It dosn't matter who did it but it does matter that more than 1 person did. Although the Congressional Panel concluded that as fact, that's as far and as much as we will ever get. If you want to know what happened and get on with your life, JFK: The Case for Conspiracy, is the only choice if you just want the facts and hear the real eyewitnessees tell the story.",0

"While I probably would not reccommend much of Gene Edwards' reading, this book is a rare and great exception.  Edwards writes in an easy to understand style that captures the reader.  This literally was a book I could not put down.  I just read for hours soaking up what the author was saying.While it is true that Edwards does not fully present how to deal with agony, especially that caused by Christians, this does not seem to be his point in writing the book.  This work is a wonderful help in getting a right perspective before God. If you want a book on relating to other Christians or dealing with conflict, sure read another book.  But if you want something to help you deal with pain inflicted by others on a personal level, this is the book(other than the Bible, of course).  Edwards helps us to see that God is behind our suffering, while not being the author of sin (that is absurd!).  In his winsome style Edwards manages to use only one passage from Scripture (I think), but beautifully combines Scripture's teaching on the subject (see Romans 8:28 and Acts 4:27-28).  Add this book to your library and buy it to minister to those hurting.  It gives great perspective to life in general and gloriously displays the sovereignty of God",1
"I would have to say this book was very entertaining! I enjoyed it greatly.  I also knew though, that this book was NOT to be informative of what a military, or Navy wife was to expect of military life and having a husband in the service.  It's her personal experiences and feelings that she had during one of her husbands many deployments.  Nowhere on the book does it say that it's an informative book.  I would have to say it was quite comical, and there were points that had me in tears. I thought it was a wonderful book, not informative, but a personal look into Mrs. Smiley's life during a deployment.  Not many women are willing to be as open, honest and candid account of some of the feelings and experiences they really had during a deployment.  And Sarah had the guts to do that.  And for that I applaud her.  I can't wait for another book to come out!  PS-I have been with my Husband who is a Corpsman for the Navy for almost 2 years now...He has been deployed twice, and I was there for one of them.  Deployments are by no means easy...but not everyone goes through them the same as every other military wife does.  I can appreceate that Sarah told us HER story with all honesty.  And I loved the book.",1
"ive written a lot of other reviews on AFI cds, but being that this one is my favorite, i cant pass it up.to the point, this album is my favorite because it contains the hardcore and brutal elements from black sails in the sunset and the melodic elements of sing the sorrow. it leans more towards black sails in the sunset though. i bought the cd mainly for of greetings and goodbyes, despair factor, and days of the phoenix, but now i am obsessed with the cd and i love every song. this is arguably my favorite cd of all time. i love when i put this cd in and i remember why AFI is my all time favorite band, has been for years, and will be for a long time. initiation - 7/10 - one of my least favorite intros mainly because of lack of vocals.lost souls - 8/10 - somewhat overated song, but i still love it. you can definitely feel the hardcore roots in this songthe nephilim - 9/10 - i love the bridge in this song and the chorus. a lot of good 'whoa's in this songever and a day - 10/10 - amazing verse in this song, my favorite verse on the cd. sweet 'whoa' part toosacrifice theory - 8/10 - one of my favorites when i first bought this cd. i love the basslineof greetings and goodbyes - 11/10 - genius. nothing else can describe it.smile - 6/10 - my least favorite song on the cd. its not awful, theres just nothing special about it. i like the group yells thoughstory at three - 8/10 - i would have given this song a 4 if it werent for the breakdown. i just cant get enough of the ""sing to me!"" part. its beautifuldays of the phoenix - 10/10 - an instant classic. still one of my favorite songscatch a hot one - 9/10 - this is an interesting song. hardcore verse, catchy, melodic, sad chorus. i love it. the breakdown is sweet toowester - 9/10 - an average song, except for the breakdown. those backup vocals are just too good6 to 8 - 8/10 - i like bits and pieces of this song, mainly the guitar solo at the end. that solo is awesome.despair faction - 9/10 - i love this song so much, especially the bridge at the end. morningstar - 8/10 - good slow melodic song. i like it, but its not the best this cd has to offer.battled (hidden track) - 5/10 - not very good for a hidden track. they couldve put so many other songs here (a winter's tale, dream of waking, who knew)buy and enjo",0
"Ozu at his best creates achingly beautiful cinematic musings on everyday life. No car chases or explosions, no murders, not a single gun is fired, not so much as a kick in the groin or even a clenched fist. His mileiu is the routine interaction among families, the ostensibly mundane issues that affect us on a daily basis, yet he presents these issues in images so meditative, so beautifully poetic, that they become timeless and profound. As I said, these qualities represent Ozu at his best. And Late Spring is one of his best films.The story is typical Ozu, a young woman enjoys living with her father while her father very much wants her to get married and leave the house. Not that the father doesn't enjoy having her around, he simply feels that she needs to experience life away from the burden of caring for him, so he is willing to make the sacrifice. Simple enough, right? It's the way Ozu tells the story that makes it heartbreaking and meaningful. He eschews conventional approaches to filmmaking, no dissolves, he goes from scene to scene via simple cuts, he lingers on hallways and doors for seconds after characters have left the frame, or before they arrive, his establishing shots are often establishing montages, a series of shots that show streets, buildings, gardens, parkways, flowers. He retains the small details most filmmakers would leave out, the routine greetings, the ""hi, how are you doing?""s, the casual preludes to pertinent conversation that might bog down a conventional film but are perfectly at home in the low key world of Ozu. In effect, his films  move at a steady and brooding rhythm, they are like mood pieces, tone poems that never deviate from this quietude. Modern American purveyors of shrill and screechy cinema(P.T. Anderson, Paul Haggis) could take a lesson from Ozu. There isn't a single raised voice in Late Spring, yet the film is more deeply moving than a thousand Magnolias. In fact, the little surprise at the end of Late Spring is the closest Ozu has ever come to a conventional ""twist"" ending, and even that develops naturally out of the story and the characters.There isn't much else to say about the film. The acting is superb. Special acknowledgement should go to Setsuko Hara's performance, the way her face says so much about what her character is going through, sans any dialogue. She has a sweet smile, and has always been good at playing happy-go-lucky characters, but with an anxious underside. She has never been better.Modern audiences, especially western audiences, might have some trouble with the idea of arranged marriage as a solution to a young woman's dilemmas. Apparently, in Japan at that time, a young woman's options were very limited, either stay at home or get married(getting an apartment or having a career were not encouraged, at least that is what the film suggests). Ozu reminds me of John Ford, he looks at communal living and conservative traditions with a somewhat bittersweet eye, but ultimately respects their places in society, mourning their passing while accepting the reality of progress. Late Spring is from another place, another time, and that needs to be taken into account, because what it says about the human condition transcends any labels of old-fashionedness.Shorter and more simple than Tokyo Story, but no less engaging. A masterpiece",0
"I gave ""Poolhall Junkies"" five stars because I love pool.  I have spent $60 in one day playing (not gambling, just paying the hourly rate).  So I can identify with the characters.  If you're not that into pool, its probably just an alright film.  I guess its exciting and whatnot, and some of the shots are just incredible no matter who you are, but its also cheesy at times.  And playing for $100,000?  I'm sorry, but that just doesn't happen.  Oh well.  Its still a favorite of mine",0
"The reviewer ""El Lagarto"" may want to note that the release date of John Coltrane's ""Ascension,"" his first proper free jazz album and first major foray into the avant-garde, is June 28, 1965.  ""Spiritual Unity"" precedes that album by approximately a year, and if I am not mistaken, Coltrane cited Ayler as an influence which helped vault him into his late period recordings.This recording is a masterpiece and must have been a revelation at the time to all with open ears.  For an even more complete and brilliant document of Ayler's influential sound and immense presence, check out the Complete Greenwich Village recordings on Impulse!  That is all for now",0

There are so many awesome artists from this area, don't spend your money on a band whose career has been made through disses.  I don't like Eminem, but Benzino and the Made Men, have 'Made' themselves by jacking others fame.  I like the guest work, but the guests are better than the group itself.  Get there stuff.  Guests can be useful but they usually show that a band is lacking talent when overused.  I listened to this album and wished I could get my money back.  It's not even worth selling, I wouldn't want to screw anyone else",0

"You know I am hard pressed to find a single musician who sounds like Tom Waits. Sure, he borrows elements from all sorts of places, from light jazz to down and dirty blues and everything that resorts in between but no one actually sounds like Tom Waits, and that's the genius of him.""Alice"" is my favorite Tom Waits record that I have heard thus far and it will probably be hard to top in my mind. ""Alice"" is a dark and depressing record in every way that that can be seen as good. It is like a journey into the head of a madman, but unlike most records of its type it never actually leaves you out.This is also Waits' most consitant record which makes sense since it is the soundtrack to a play from the early ninties. The songs don't seem to tell a story of any sort, but they all keep a certain mood and texture even though not any two songs sound a thing alike.What can you expect to get from ""Alice"" you maybe thinking to yourself if you have yet to hear it. Well, jazz band trios playing vaudville music on trash can with an inebreiated carney barking in the background after one too many cigarettes is the best way I can think to descrbie it even though it doesn't explain the record very well. ""Alice"" shifts from a cool, smooth Tom Waits voice that is reminscent in the best of ways of Leonard Cohen on tracks like ""Alice"" and ""Flowers Grave"", a truly flawless and beautiful song, to a demented bark that will keep your kids up at night in terror like on the strangely absurd yet brilliant ""Everything You Can Think Of Is True""(which features the finest line in Waits' catalog: ""And fishes make wishes on you""). The music that backs him in perfectly calm and gorgeous, all violins and cellos and guitar played with a perfect minimalistic approach that is a breath of fresh air from all the over produced, lifeless ""music"" that people listen to today.I hardly ever give records five stars because most records don't deserve it. Even great records by great artists rarely deserve five stars, which in my mind means flawless, amazing and top of its genre in every way: music, lyrics, feel, pacakging etc. And ""Alice"" fits that bill to a T. It's one of the most beautiful, frightining, interesting, surreal and amazing records I have ever heard and should be considered essential listening by every one who can come in contatct with it.Hence, a truly classic album. The ones that remind you why you love music and make you want to create your own. And that is ""Alice"" and Tom Waits in a nutshell",0

"""a descent into oneself, a way of using the mechanism of the dream without sleeping, a crooked candle, often mysteriously blown out, carried about in the night of the human body."" ~ Jean CocteauBlood of a Poet is surprisingly captivating and encourages the viewer to remain completely attentive by capturing surprise in every moment. Who would think a ball of snow would destroy a human life or that a mouth could transfer from a painting onto a hand like a sensual stigmata. As a man struggles to comprehend his newly found ""life-giving"" force, he kisses a statue into life and then becomes a voyeur in a world of bizarre occurrences after splashing through a mirror, a scene that made me laugh with surprise. Here, decorative angels climb down off walls, walk across ceilings and housekeepers sigh in frustration. The violent scenes are more like scenes from a dream and in black-and-white, the effect is rather mild and the suicide seems to be unsuccessful. The idea is more about the artistic look of the black blood than the actual death of the individuals. It is very experimental in nature and more art than death. Recently while watching a set of music videos directed by Anton Corbijn, I did notice a direct correlation between this movie and a 1984 music video where a hand (complete with faces instead of just lips) follows a woman and people try to step through mirrors. It could have just as easily been inspired by Alice in Wonderland, but I have my sneaking suspicion ""Blood of a Poet"" has inspired more than a few music videos. The beginning of this movie seems to stay in your mind for a few days as you consider the meanings and symbolism.

Now I want to buy 10 copies and give it to those I care about.  The twelve steps are presented to you in a way that allows you to appreciate the journey.  Trudging the road to happy destiny, I couldn't put the book down!  I'm starting to read it again and have formed a group w/several other women, we will meet monthly and go through each chapter so we can continue to grow together -- one day at a time.  Bless you Tyler and Bob...and Edward Bear wherever you are",1
"One of the great, legendary broadway performances of all time, and you can sense it from the CD. The score is pure 60's broadway fare, better than Hello Dolly. Every song is catchy, some have become downright classics. And every song and every moment work.The film version totally sinks under Lucille Ball. What should have been a madcap tunefest, is a lugubrious, plodding mess, thanks to Lucy. Not her fault, she was totally wrong for the part. But Warner Bros. and Jack Warner had a history of ruining film musicals in order to cast big names. Think Roz Russell in Gypsy, Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady, Vanessa Redgrave in Camelot. They wanted to cast Cary Grant (who flat out refused, and threatened not to see it) in place of Robert Preston in The Music Man. All talented performers, usually dubbed, but lacking something that the originals had. Think of how perfect My Fair Lady would have been with Julie Andrews? And how marvelous Mame could have been had Lansbury (who was a bona fide movie star) recreated the role. Bea Arthur did recreate her part and very nearly steals the whole film. (As did Jane Connell as Gooch)But the original stage musical, as close to perfection as it could get",0
"As one reviewer mention ""If you want to see a blast from the past"" This is the One ! . Mark (Albert Finney 1936- ) and Joanna (Audrey Hepburn 1929-1993) have a kind of marriage where barbs and insult mean more to them than all the endearments ever spoken . During a present day trip to the South of France , they remember other European jaunts they made . On their experience anew first glowe of pasion , the aching loneliness of being apart , the elation of cresting a hill at sunrise , the joy of making up after a fight , and ultimately they eatablish what it mean to them to be a couple . Yes in this movie its a lot of talking , but in beautiful French country side , not much of studio shoting here . For those nostalgic dreamers this is a good movie ! . High Quality transfer and by me higly recommende",0
"This book reenforced the investment classes I had in my MBA program.  The author very slowly walks you through the ideas of building a balanced portfolio based on the idea of the efficient frontier (getting the maximum return for a level of risk).  You would be well served to have had a statistics class, or at least a solid understanding of terms like standard deviation to get the most out of this book.",1
"Missy Elliott always provides an exciting listen and she always seems to be able to reinvent herself.  Her co-productions with Timbaland always yield exciting, energetic backgrounds in which she either spits a hard-rhyme or croons a sultry ballad with her very nice alto voice.  Face it, Missy does many more things than your typical rapper does, and it makes her stand out, no matter the quality of what she is doing (not to say that quality doesn't matter).  What makes UNDER CONSTRUCTION so good first of all is the fact that Missy isn't afraid to tell things the way that they are.  She doesn't try to hold back language-wise or sexuality-wise.  When Missy has something to say, she says it, which makes her both edgy and both honest.  Why sugar coat the truth?  Missy tells what she is feeling (even if it grows quite explicit at times) and that is what music is about isn't it? Who wants to hear lies? Back to the point...UNDER CONSTRUCTION is arguably Missy's best album (...SO ADDICTIVE is a close as well).  It features so many unique ideas and sounds and shows Missy exploring different facets of her talents.  While most will say that ""Work It"", her Grammy winning performance, is the highlight, I think it is her incredible ""Gossip Folks"" feat. Ludacris that steals the show.  Yet, one can't forget the somewhat nasty, but lovable ""P***ycat"" where Missy sings so lovely (as she always does).  It isn't common that you can find a rapper who could've made it as a singer, which I think Missy could've easily done.  ""Nothing There For Me"", which features Beyonce Knowles is another hit.  Beyonce sings angelically and Missy does her thing as usual.  There is really no need to point out anymore individual songs or performances on this CD because they are all good.  The guest performance by Jay-Z on this album is much better than it is on her 2003 follow-up THIS IS NOT A TEST (""Wake Up"").  This is a great CD that deserves every bit of hype and recognition that it received when it first came out and still received.  I hear ""Work It"" being played all the time now and it has been 3 years since the release of this great title, which will surely go down in music history (or at least hip-hop history!).  5 stars, easily.",0
"Having read literally hundreds of travelogues, I must say this is simply one of the finest I have ever run into. Eric's experiences are unusually wonderful, and his writing is magical. His focus on the Yemeni people and their lives and experiences make this book far more engaging than travelogues that focus on personal experiences, interpretations or places visited and described.Kudos Mr. Hansen! I thought I had travelled enough and read enough about other people's travels. Your experiences are illuminating and incomparable.-",1
Arnold Lobel is a master story teller! He really knows how to capture a child's attention and tickle his imagination and funny bone. All of the stories in this book are great and should be classics if they are not already. My son (5 years) started this book and could not put it down! He read 5 of the 7 chapters at once and only reluctantly stopped because I told him it was time for bed. He continued with the rest of the 2 chapters in the morning. Any book that can do that gets and deserves 5 stars,1
"I received this title from Amazon only to find that the included DVD which contains files manditory for working on the tutorials was melted by the publisher's hot glue binding process. One side of the DVD literally melted.  If you buy this volume or any other title from Sybex make sure the Dvd is intact (don't buy it online). Their customer service is nill; I sent them an email from their site a week ago and have yet to get a response.  It's probably a great book, but rather useless without the disk. You might want to wait untill a non-vanity press publisher picks it up and it gets a decent treatment",1
"I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys peaceful relaxing music mixed with breathtaking scenery. This DVD offers the viewer different sections each one filled with visually stimulating scenes. The quality of filming in this production is far superior to any other relaxation/meditation DVD that I have watched. The sound quality is also excellent, when played on a good sound system you will feel transported into the scenes. It's impossible to feel anything but positive while watching this DVD, so sit back, relax and enjoy",0

"This is a great book for a variety of ages of children. You can start by reading the little ones this book because there is only one word or label per page, such as ""hill"" or ""snowman"". So the ones who are impatient can keep flipping those pages fast as you read! When they get older and learn to read it's a great book to start with, because they can match the word with the picture in the book. And at any age it is fun to examine the gorgeous illustrations. Not only do many of the objects reappear from one page to another, but if you are paying close attention you can watch the progression of the seasons. I loved this book so much I bought it as a gift for a friend, and now we are both hooked on all books with Alison Jay illustrations",1
"This has more infomation than any other book!   It tells you the email addresses of what is a wealth of information most of which I had never heard of.  It even tells you how to build your own poker table.  Im amazed.  Not only that, the poker logic and advice on how to play is outstanding.  Anyone who plays hold'em, and especially those who like NL tournaments, well, this is a must buy.  It is in the same class as the Harrington books and The Little Green Boo",1

"I teach graduate level research courses and reviewed this book for the publisher. There are so many errors in this book that I cannot even begin to list them. I could not in all practicality use this book with my students because of the multiple theoretical and conceptual errors.

There are many other texts that do a much better job discussing Action Research that are more practical, precise, make relevant connections to practice, and  offer theoretical and conceptual accuracies",1
"My sister saw the TV ad and ordered the Miracle Blade III Set. Now I knew the said ad and when she told me I was amazed that she once again used TV shopping to buy cheap products who are no good. What can one expect for that price, it's just too good to be true so people should use common sense and be suspicious. And think about the costs of all these TV ads worldwide, they have to calculate that into the price too so one can imagine how much the actual production cost must be; no wonder they let them manufacture somewhere in China!So the Set arrived and my sister used it often and was pleased at first. I'll admit the blades are razorsharp, be cautious when using them at first, but that's about it. After about 4 or 5 months they start to rust and they get dull too. Logos are falling off and they look terrible. The customer support is just plain awful; they didn't respond to several emails and when my sister tried to phone them she couldn't reach anyone besides the answering machine!!! In the end we didn't even try further to use the so called ""lifetime warrant"" and diposed the set.Stay away from Miracle Blade, do yourself a favour and buy a real quality set, there are plenty around (I won't mention a name) and for 200$ you get a solid set which will really last for a lifetime.Oh, and to other addicted online shoppers: please do some research on the Net before you pick up that phone and place your order. The ads look nice but these are all paid actors like the silly Chief Tony!",0

"I am very proud to have the box set.Any country fan, regardless new or classic must have this box set. for several reasons:A. Hank was and still is one of the foundations of influences of the artists that came after his short run (less than 6 years). B. To enjoy the song writing craft that Hank was gifted with.C. A clean marketing deal from the record company by releasing the complete Hank recordings. Lucky for us, No greedy marketing scam by releasing the complete set in installments.D. Heck a lot of Hank's songs have been covered over and over again by stars from the 50's all the way to today. So it is a great chance for you to hear the original recording.I do agree with some previous reviewers that the packaging is nicely made, as the CDs are inside a book about Hank, with a number of photos. The only downside to the packaging is that it might actually scratch the CDs. but it and Ipod it.In the end, I truly enjoy listening to the box set, and I certainly do hope you do too.All the best,Nawa",0

"Team tall, handsome Tom Selleck with a Louis L'Amour classic, toss in Katherine Ross and Sam Elliott and you have western romance at its finest.  Tom is one of these wonderful actors who is comfortable whether in the saddle or driving a red Porsche. He's totally believable. I would say integrity, honesty, and doing what's right is the trademark of the roles Tom Selleck chooses and this movie is a winner.  It has romance, tension, conflict, good guys, bad guys and a happy ending.  I highly recommend this movie.  It's a keeper to be watched more than once.Elizabeth Clement",0

When doing push-ups, however, I noticed that there isn't much support for the knees.  But do you really need a mat for push-ups?  Overall, I recommend it for the average workout person.  For those hard-cores out there, you may want to invest in a thicker, more padded mat.  I like it because it is easy to transport and makes a quick and comfortable bed after a late night out",0
"I purchased the DSC-S90 4.1 camera for myself for christmas from Best Buy because I had $70 in certificates for them.  The Carl Zeis lens is great and it takes beautiful pictures up to 8x10 and 11x14 are good.  It has so many features and the battery life is great.  It came with a charger and two sony batteries, but I use regular Duracell Alkaline batteries and can fill up a memory stick (256K) without changing them.  A big improvement over the old one I had.  I used it in Hawaii and found the video to be good as well and it also records voice.   For the person who has a problem with the batteries and memory stick in the same compartment, just turn the camera upside down to remove the memory stick and your batteries won't fall out.  I would recommend the camera and plan to buy another for my son.  Buy your memory sticks on Amazon.com and the price is good.  I paid $30 + for my 256 memory pro and at the rate I take pictures that is the equivilent of four 4packs of 400asa film.  Not so bad when you think of it that way. ",0

The boy likes it better than his Eddie Bauer baby seat that cost 3 times as much.",0
"In this book Shlomo Ovadia gives an excellent introduction to many aspects of CATV technology. Starting from the analog TV background, following by optical transmission, the author covers issues in modulation, impairments, protocols and applications.

"I was not a fan of Star Trek Enterprise when it was originally broadcast...as a fan of all the other franchises, they sort of lost me during the second season.  I did purchase all four seasons and in hindsight, I should have hung in a little longer when the shows were broadcast.  Season 3 was much better than Season 2 (the season long story arc was impressive) and Season 4 even better than 3.Standouts included the exploration of the Vulcan and Andorian cultures.  The only issue I had with the Fourth Season is that it (and the series) sort of wilted at the end.  Rather than having a block-buster ending, the flash back to a number of years after the story really ended (basically giving the run two endings) was anti-climatic.  And what happens with Tripp did nothing to enhance the drama of the story - it was like it was an after thought to get ratings or something.The sad thing is, the series didn't need help at that point - the stories had turned around and it had become engaging again.  Unfortunate that Paramount had already made the decision to end the run - with the injection of creativeness that Season 4 demonstrated, the series could have continued and fulfilled the seven year trend as had its predecessors.

Of course there's the usual 100 pages where the Dr toots his own horn which have no benefit to the reader, but after that its all business. Lots of good recipes and general health info. He even tells the reader what vitamins and herbs to take for each type. So read this book.  There is also a lot of FREE info on the net.  Check it out",1
This is a fascinating read.  The book does a very good job of outlining the background of Saddam Hussein and traces his rise to power with extraordinary insight.

"Most sneakers these days come in two varieties--they're huge athletic clod-hoppers for teenieboppers, or they're white keds or orthotic shoes for old ladies.This sneaker is the best compromise on the market today.  It's youthful without being for the young.  Light-weight, low-profile, wide enough for a thick sock, and it'll get you compliments everywhere you go.My first pair is in black, and wow, they are stylish.  Today I wore them out shopping, and my back started hurting before my feet did.  My one objection is this supposedly 'squishy' foot bed.  I don't know if my shoes were missing that part or what, but I found the sole to be hard and inflexible.  They were still _comfortable_ but it wasn't like putting your feet on pillows or anything.If you do prefer a squishier footbed, I recommend a thin insert, so as not to squish your toes.  I'm not sure if they would perform well for athletics--I'm going to be saving mine for errands and casual nights out, but I want these in every color",0
"When upper class gent Tony (James Fox) returns to London from Africa, he acquires a house, and he also advertises for a manservant. Hugo Bennett (Dirk Bogarde) applies and is speedily employed. At first, he is the perfect servant. He's quiet, obsequious and efficient. Tony's girlfriend Susan (Wendy Craig), however finds Hugo sneaky and suspicious, and she considers the entire notion of having a manservant archaic. ""The Servant"", directed by Joseph Losey, is based on a Harold Pinter play and is a perfect example of the Hegel theory of the master-slave relationship. Hegel's theory is that both the master and slave are inevitably corrupted by the unhealthy mutual need in this relationship. The relationship between Tony and Hugo is the main focus of the film, and Pinter's screenplay is a scathing metaphor for the class war. The relationship between Tony and Hugo swings wildly from cutting, humiliating, gratuitous comments, to fumbled attempts at friendship. But with such inequities in position alone, any attempt at some sort of equality is ludicrous. The roles of exploiter and the exploited switch back and forth between Tony and Hugo as the power base in the household moves. Dirk Bogarde is phenomenal as Hugo. The role of the servant was made for his incredible acting ability. Hugo is, at first, a dreadful toady, but is soon revealed as opportunistic, sly and depraved. His role is in complete contrast to Tony, played by James Fox--who is effete, helpless and malleable. The two main female roles are also in contrast to one another. Vera (Sarah Miles) is the seductive, giggly working class girl whose free sexuality is the opposite of the ice maiden, Susan, who doles out favours as they are merited. The film, a three British Academy Award winner, is a little dated, but it still packs a powerful punch with its unsettling storyline--displacedhuman",0

"How many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.  The SimpleTech STI-SD/256 256MB SecureDigital Card SD, like most 256MB cards, will store on average 284 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 213 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  128 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 102 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 80 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs",0

"I stumbled upon this CD after hearing K&D's brilliant ""Sessions"". ""Conversions"" is pure drum and bass. The beats are tight, the bass is deep and warm, all overlayed with beautiful ambient flourishes. The first four tracks are average/pretty good, but they're only a warm-up. The real journey begins when K&D kick it into high-gear with the final 6 tracks. Starting with ""One and Only"" and ending with ""The Lick"", this seamless stretch of drum and bass is excellent and addictive. Drum and bass fans should definitely check out this cd.Also, if for some reason you don't have the K&D Sessions cd, make sure you pick that up as well. It's different than this, less drum and bass and more downtempo-chillout with more variety.",0
"This is one of my favorite books, beyond all genre.Dan is an independent American man, a hard-working character who would rather make it on his own as a poor man than have wealth and riches handed to him. A great engineer who works on machines to answer demand for domestic chores, Dan is on the verge of a robotic break through that will revolutionize his industry when he is tricked by his partners and forced into ""Long Sleep"", from which he awakens thirty years later in the year 2000.The novel is told in first person view from Dan's perspective, which usually ends in failure for most authors. Heinlein uses the tense extraordinarily well and naturally. Furthermore, Heinlein has characterization down very well-not only of his human characters, but also of cat characters. His opening paragraphs about Pete the tomcat who routinely visits all the doors during winter looking for the ""door into summer"" sounds so much like my own cat that I laugh everytime I read it.The book also has interesting insight into a ""future world"" (2000)-although very incorrect. Nevertheless, it would be a nice thing indeed if there was currently a cure for the common cold (I'm just getting over one right now myself) and pills that kept teeth from ever decaying (no more dentists!). Other speculations such as a way to entirely clear smog and some commentary on a nuclear war also make the book interesting.There are only a few twists and turns throughout the plot; the story mainly focuses on Dan and how he overcomes his obstacles. It is an extraordinarily well-done tale, and not a boring page in the novel.Heinlein is a genuinely good writer who will always be among my favorites",1

"During the early 80s, a young man came upon me pensively fingering THE SNOW QUEEN in a local bookstore. ""Go for it,"" the voice behind me said. ""It's a good one."" I had tended to avoid the science fiction genre, considering it rather cold and--well--sexist. I soon became grateful for that anonymous recommendation.What drew me to the book was the promise of strong female characters from the imagination of a female author. To my delight it was also loaded with many other elements that warmed the heart of my twenty-something self, among them a goddess myth, ecological awareness, the struggle of indigenous cultures, and romance too! I devoured THE SNOW QUEEN and named it one of my Very Favorite Books.After many years, I recently revisited The Snow Queen universe. My much-older self still loves it.On the watery planet Tiamat, a variety of self-interested cultures inhabit its decadent city Carbuncle. Thoughtful characters struggle internally and with each other. There is no warfare but there is plenty of adventure. Themes of traditional stories are interwoven with sci fi and contemporary elements to create a colorful tale for grown-ups. Joan D. Vinge's creation is marvelously complex and fluidly rendered.The book has a refreshing variety of female characters, in both lead and supporting roles. Even in today's adventure genres, women are still grossly outnumbered. Stories often have one or two token representatives, such as a manipulative harpy or a swashbuckling babe. Not so with THE SNOW QUEEN. For example, Arienrhod the Queen is indeed cruel and manipulative, but she is also fighting the imposed subordination that paralyzes her world. And although police officer Jerusha PalaThion is admirably tough, she is also overwhelmed by her circumstances. And refreshingly, NOT a babe.Ms. Vinge excels at getting us into the minds of her characters as they attempt to sort out emotions and moral choices. Alas, she is not always a master of dialogue. Sometimes the characters utter banalities and heavy-handed pronouncements, as if they've become aware that they are partaking in an epic story. Some characters who are shown only through their words and deeds, such as thieving nomad Blodwed, are never convincing. OK, so the book isn't perfect. But as I said, I still love it. At times Moon, the heroine, seems like a vacuous flower child, to whom captive animals are drawn as if she's a Disney princess. But she's also determined and plucky. As her awareness of the greater universe grows, she works hard to ensure her place in it. So I root for her. When she communes with the intelligent ocean mammal mers, I think: wow, being at one with Nature is such a great fantasy. When she bites a sadistic captor I think, ""Hooray, I'm relieved she didn't try to win him over."" When she fulfillingly makes love with two different men within twenty-four hours, I think, ""You go!""Simply put, THE SNOW QUEEN is a terrific story. Journeys are taken. Characters grow and change. Love can be consuming and life-altering--or confusing and mushy. Endings can be satisfying without promising a happily-ever-after life. ""Go for it, it's a good one.",1

"After checking prices with all the usual pricing bots, I found a better price, including free shipping, by going directly to Amazon. This lowest price did not appear in the other searches, so it pays to go to Amazon first.I replaced my Canon SD400 with the Casio and find the controls more logical to use. This is important if you don't use the camera for a while, because you can just pick it up and start shooting without hunting for the manual. Also, the docking base is much more convenient than plugging small cables into the camera. You do not have to remove the battery in the Casio to charge it as you do with the Canon SD400. The VGA movie quality is superior on the Casio. Still pictures appear to be about equal. Amazon delivered by UPS in record time even with a weekend inbetween.

"I'm not going to review the entire album like others but i will write that this album is terrific. Forget all you nay sayers, who say that this album is  boring and filled with filler tricks and is as bad as the x factor. you guys have no clue how good these guys are. Sure their vocals and some of their musical copacities and skills may have decreased over the years, but its the thought that counts. Iron Maiden is one of the few bands that are still chugging along on their musical journey since 1980. Iron Maiden can and will do whatever they want. If you don't like 'em, tough. You either join them on their journey or not. As for me, I'm still going on with them. With excellent tracks on here such as The wicker man, The ghost of the navigator, Brave New World, Dream of mirrors, and Out of the silent planet, this is almost as good as powerslave.

"This book is very well written and helped me through a tough period in my life when I read it in the 80's.  I had been having flashbacks and decided to see if I could figure out what was going on.  It provided me with a blueprint and a course of action, which helped me find myself and do something about what had happened to me.  I would recommend this book to any victims of childhood sexual abuse",1
"This has to be one of the best trance albums ever, although slightly flawed. Disc one is a little weak after the first two tracks, but disc two is truly awesome, especially ""Binary Finary"" and ""In My Dreams"". Better than Tiesto, PVD, and Oakenfold. Why? Because it has emotion and has moments of pure bliss. This music makes me feel intelligent and young again. BTW, I am 52 years old (maybe you noticed I can spell",0
I have to say that I have never disliked anything that Joanne Harris has written. But this is the best since Five Quarters of the Orange. In a complete change of setting - hardly any mention of France - this is set in a posh Private School in the north of England. It could be described as a whodunnit. But for much of the book  it could be described as a whodunwhat. We know that some mayhem is afoot but do not actually know what it is. All of this makes it very difficult to put down - I read it in about three sittings. The characters are typically well written. Especially the wonderful Straitly - aiming for a century of terms in the school that has been his life - and the Brodiesque devotion to 'his boys'. As ever there is a lurking and increasing darkness with twists and turns on every page.Five stars. Read it,1
"This book tells the story of the greatest biographical masterpiece in the English language. In the course of it we learn to appreciate the skill, dedication, persistence  and great art of Boswell. This is Sisman's description of Boswell as he wrote the life  : ""The story of Boswell's life as he wrote the epic Life of Johnson is itself an epic: in the process Boswell experienced an extraordinary degree of exhilaration and depression, pride, humiliation, confidence, doubt, satisfaction, hurt, loneliness, disillusionment and grief."" A man of great ambition, Boswell had little to show for his efforts at the time of Johnson's death. Writing the biography ""was his last hope of achieving anything worthwhile.""But Boswell through his great diligence, his careful noting down of the words of his great friend, his artful reshaping of much of what he heard, his willingness to tell not simply of virtues but of faults, his ability to present the whole man, succeeded in giving the world the picture of the Great Cham which attracts and moves us to this day. Gruff, easily made irritable, but capable of incredible kindness, always fierce and fast in his remarks, tremendously knowledgeable, a loyal friend, the master maker of the Dictionary, Johnson is presented by Boswell as a fully rounded character. Sisman gives the background to the lives of these two giants of English Literature. He focuses on Boswell's preparation for the work and his ongoing method of execution. He reveals in details the way one great masterpiece of world- literature was made by someone often derided by those of his own time.",1
"This cast and director give the best performance of these stories of any I know. Joan Hickson is the ultimate Miss Marple, because she played the character with dignity and wisdom. The series is watchable any number of times, because you find something new each time you watch it.The transfer to DVD is excellent in both picture and sound, and the menu system is easy to use",0
"For years we waited for it, and it finally ahppened, as Batman and Superman teamed up to thwart their greatest foes, The Joker and Lex Luthor. Gloriously animated and presented like it was a real movie rather than a cartoon, ""The Batman Superman Movie"" ranks with ""Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm"" and ""Batman & Mr. Freeze: Subzero"" as the ultimate animated adaptions of the Dark Knight and the Man Of Steel.The Joker (voiced by the great Markk Hammil) and his accomplice Harley Quinn (Arleen Sorkin) have robbed a pricless artifact from an antiquie shop in Gotham. Batman (Kevin Conroy) seems to be one step ahead of them, and his alter ego Bruce Wayne heads out to Metropolis, home of Superman (Tim Daly). Meanwhile, Joker has teamed up with wealthy industrialist Lex Luthor (Clancy Brown), offering to kill Superman for $ 1 billion dollars. To complicate things, Bruce Wayne has fallen for Lois Lane (Dana Delany), enraging Clark Kent, who is determined to find out who Batman is. The two learn each other's secret identities, and realize they must team up to stop The Joker and Lex from destroying Metropolis.This is an excellent animated films that I'd recommend to all comic book fans. It is affordable and comes with extras",0
"A true visionary of the highest calibar, Ms. Amidon has once again blessed the world community with a working masterpiece.  This book is a must read for anyone responsible for developing sustainable strategies or policies for countries, organizations or world regions.  In a world that appears to be in chaos and spiraling out of control, this work serves to bring understanding and insight necessary for the development of progressive and sustainable change. In essence, Ms. Amidon  not only makes it clear that such changes warranted, but she delivers the hope that they are possible.The requisite courage and leadership to initiate and execute such change, must be brought to the table by the bold and earnest practicioner.  There is after all, only so much a book can do. However, and in that regard, Ms. Amidon has once again truly demonstrated her courage and leadership by producing this original and thought provoking work",1

"Gulberg develops mathematics within its historical context, which is something I rarely find in math books today. Starting with the invention of numbers and proceeding through the arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus, the book has something for everyone.It's hard to believe that Gullberg was a surgeon by training.  Gullberg took 10 years to create this book. Sadly, Gullberg died at age 62 in 1998.  Fortunately, he lived long enough to see the publication of this great book.",1
"I really enjoyed savouring this gem. This wasn't a book to be devoured but enjoyed for all the details of time and place and dialog that is quite good. In those details I was transported into a perspective of our historical culture that I never have experienced before. Ms. Price experienced the 60's and commune life from quite a different view than I expected. Yes, there was the ""normal"" sex-capades, pot, and a dislike of bougouis society, but through it all a voice shines through as she is just watching herself from within that same consumer society. Voluntary poverty and....Food Stamps? I never would have thought!  The experiment shows through. I did feel she held back from exposing much that I was looking to read about, but I guess some were kept out to protect the innocent.  It was gilded with elloquence but there was that veil of herself fighting to be a Hippie with all her heart, and her wanting acceptance from her family. I really wanted her to to bust out and be all that she wanted without mental chains. After finishing the book I came away with what I felt was an understanding of what personal freedom can mean and how it works within two opposing paradigms. The two really don't blend but through Roberta's eyes I found how it's possible they still can.",1

Lucky for me, the vinegar man has done it for all of us.  If you are into zymurgy, or have dabbled in making vinegar read this book",1
"I wanted to like this book so much, I really did.  The cover is enticing and the story it is based on is a classic.  But I simply could not read beyond about page 150.  I threw the book out.Here are some books I loved, which I thought this would resemble: The Mists of Avalon, The Pullman Trilogy, The Dark is Rising Series, the Mabinogion.This book was like none of these.  On a sentence level, it is badly written.  On a plot level, it is extremely slooow.  The magical elements had yet to get going at the point I stopped.  This would be fine if the exposition was rich and entertaining but instead it was a stilted, sappy account of campus life at a liberal arts college in Ohio -- a bit like Buffy the Vampire Slayer without vampires.  Skimming through the book to the end, I did not in fact see any evidence that there are mythical or magical elements in the story.  I know they must be in there, but they are buried.  I cannot say enough about how bad the dialogue is, featuring long conversations between girls about how bad their menstrual cramps are, long sparring sessions of poetry quoting, and ""in jokes"" about Classics students.  Maybe if you are in middle school and feel very wistful about college this would seem cool, but I don't know.  I think it is not nearly smart enough",1

"This book details the present trend of private military firms and providers replacing state-financed armies in several key areas of national defense.  Like most good econ students, before reading this book I was under the impression that armies had always been national entities and mercenaries were the exception to the rule.  It was truly shocking to find out that the only century in the history of the world where the majority of soldiers were direct employees of states was the twentieth century.  (Is it therefore a coincidence that the greatest and most destructive wars in the history of the world were fought in the twentieth century?  Maybe)  This book showed me that the most unquestioned public good, the military, might be better provided by the market than by the state.  Where I depart from the author is in his analysis and fear of the trends he describes.  It is an unquestioned fact that private entities are better providers of good and services than government and Singer gives significant evidence to prove that this is true even I the realm of national defense.  As history shows, it is far more dangerous to trust a President, Fuehrer, General Secretary, or King with a sole monopoly on military force than it is to pick one's source of protection from the market.  I would feel much more comfortable and be much safer with several militaries competing for my business through market mechanisms, rather than it being supplied ""freely"" by an all powerful national monopolies.  Although Singer is a fantastic historian/analyst and his book is a first rate piece of research that is accessible to even laymen, his conclusions don't match his evidence.      ",1

"When they told me that someone named Tim Sullivan wanted to remake Herschell Gordon Lewis's classic 1964 gross out ""Two Thousand Maniacs,"" I knew I needed to sit up and pay attention. Who is this Sullivan guy? And why does he think he has the stones to remake a classic H.G. Lewis pukefest? It takes a lot of gall to mess around with a Lewis flick. He is, after all, the Godfather of Gore, the guy that made all the blood and guts flicks we see today possible. You wouldn't have a ""Hostel"" without ""Blood Feast"" and ""The Wizard of Gore"". It was Lewis that made it possible to put eye gouging, arm tearing, and tongue ripping--to cite just a few examples--up on the silver screen for all to see. The effects rarely looked convincing, not on the zero budgets Lewis worked with, but the results had an impact on audiences. People loved the shock value, Lewis made money, and other filmmakers started using blood and guts. Unfortunately, as the years passed, Herschell Gordon Lewis quit making movies and drifted into obscurity. Then DVD arrived and introduced his work to a new audience. And then came the inevitable remake...""2001 Maniacs"" starts by introducing us to a group of foul mouthed, obnoxious jerks known to horror aficionados as ""cannon fodder"". Yep, that's right. We don't have to care that much about these trashy young kids because we know that they exist solely to die painful, cruel, and bloody deaths. Spring Break bound students Anderson (Jay Gillespie), Cory (Matthew Carey), Nelson (Dylan Edrington) meet up with Ricky (Brian Gross), Joey (Marla Malcolm), Kat (Gina Marie Heekin), Malcolm (Mushond Lee), and his girlfriend Leah (Bianca Smith) when they get lost in the middle of Georgia. Yeah, they're going to Florida for fun and sun, but they ain't going to get there after receiving questionable directions from a hick gas station attendant (played by Travis Tritt). Instead, our heroes wind up in the little town of Pleasant Valley, and just in time to attend the Guts and Glory Jubilee. Oh yeah! The folks living in this town seem friendly, if not a little odd around the edges, but our Yankee visitors are dumber than a box of rocks and don't seem to sense the danger. Too bad for them. You see, Pleasant Valley has a grim little secret, a bloody and gory secret.If you've seen Lewis's original film, you already know the secret of Pleasant Valley. It involves the Civil War and plenty of revenge against the hated Yankee invaders. And since our youngsters come from up North, they're going to experience Pleasant Valley's kindness up close and personal. Mayor Buckman (Robert Englund), his son Lester (Adam Robitel), Granny Boone (Lin Shaye), the adorable Peaches (Wendy Kremer), Harper Alexander (Giuseppe Andrews), and the other townsfolk are not about to let our guests leave town without a heaping dose of that famous Southern hospitality. A few examples are free room and board, lots of booze, and plenty of lovin' for both the boys and the girls. Other acts of kindness include drawing and quartering by horses, acid hidden in a moonshine jug, musical numbers, cannibalism, castration, crushing, kissing cousins, skewering, stabbing, and general all-around maiming of the human form. These Pleasant Valley folks sure know how to welcome visitors! At least when the bloodshed finally abates after the horrific conclusion to the Guts and Glory Jubilee, two of the kids escape to tell the world about the horrors they have witnessed. Or do they? One thing's for certain--there's a sequel coming soon to a grindhouse near you!It's refreshing to see a remake of a classic horror film that really works. H.G. Lewis should really enjoy Sullivan's ""2001 Maniacs"". It's got everything the original had while adding new charms to the story. It's campy as all get out, it's got gore oozing out of every pore, and it's got black humor to spare. Even Lewis's music from the original makes an appearance here, as does the idea of a roving band of minstrels telling us what's happening through song. Sullivan goes above and beyond Lewis's original script, however, when he injects his version of Pleasant Valley with lots of politically incorrect killings and humor. Nothing is sacred in ""2001 Maniacs"" as the movie skewers everything from bestiality to race relations without pulling punches. About the only thing missing from the original film is the barrel with nails gag. You won't miss it too much, however, as plenty of other interesting stuff keeps you occupied. For example, casting Robert Englund and Lin Shaye as the two main baddies in Pleasant Valley was a stroke of genius. They camp it up with wild abandon. Then there's Christa Campbell as the Milk Maiden. Even Eli Roth shows up in a cameo instantly familiar to anyone who has watched ""Cabin Fever"".The DVD version of ""2001 Maniacs,"" brought to us by the folks over at Lionsgate, is excellent. We get the uncut version of the film in pristine glory, an audition reel, an alternate opening with John Landis, a few deleted/extended scenes, a handful of trailers, an amusing making of featurette covering most aspects of the production, and a couple of audio commentaries. One of these commentaries features Robert Englund in all of his hilarious glory, so definitely give that one a listen. Yes sir, you can't go wrong picking up a copy of ""2001 Maniacs"" today. It's rude, it's crude, and it's an instant classic. I'm so happy Tim Sullivan made such a magnificent tribute to the great H.G. Lewis. I'm also hoping the sequel lives up to this film. And remember: The South Will Rise Again!",0
"""1947 -- Earth"" is stunning, ravishing both visually and emotionally.  The story is, ostensibly, about a particular time and place -- the city of Lahore, just on the line where the August 1947 end of the British Raj would crack the subcontinent into two parts.  In a real sense, though, the film is not about one piece of history safely long ago and in someplace comfortably far away from us.  It is about human behavior: what we hope we'll do, and what we're afraid we'll do.Deepa Mehta's work here surely does impact most deeply on Indian and Pakistani audiences precisely because it IS their personal history.  But look at Bosnia, Kosovo, Rwanda, Darfur, 9/11, Iraq, Abu Ghraib,the bombings in Madrid and London -- the darkness there is the same one Mehta shows us in ""Earth.""  She's talking about (and warning) people like us, too.  The cast is remarkable.  Even small roles are in the hands of quality like Kuhlbushan Kharbanda and Raguvir Yadav.  The girl who is Lenny-baby beautifully combines innocence with the willful caprice of a child who's been over-indulged.  Rahul Khanna has the sweetness of one who loves but has nothing to lose and everything to gain.  Nandita Das' Shanta -- a flower around which Musselman, Hindu, Sikh, and Parsi bees all hover -- is knowledgeably flirtatious yet obtusely unobservant, or perhaps careless, of her effect.  Best of all is Aamir Khan, whose Ice-Candy Man sees what is inside him, tries to stave it off, and then can do no more.  Khan knows the value of stillnes.  In that stillnes, his eyes -- Olivier eyes -- look at us, show us what he's seen inside and show us what we should fear inside ourselves",0
"I ordered this book when I was researching the Mail Order industry.  I was looking for resources - the title and publisher reviews looked hopeful.

No new information was gleaned from this book",1
"For years, speedskaters have lived on 15 year old books and magazine articles for technique and training tips. Now, there is one great resource for skate knowledge.

He manages to show  in photographs the basic components that we all need to learn and perfect  to be great skaters. The drills for improving technique range from simple  to genius.

"I picked this guide up while shopping for graphic design books at my local Borders. While most of the other references on logo design were either shoddy books for non-designers or glorified portfolios with little explanatory text, this book actually delves into a discussion about good logo design. Understanding the ""hows"" and, most importantly, the ""whys"" behind a designer's decisions is more useful for learning and improving your own design work. The author explains these things clearly and with more personality than your typical reference guide author. I bought this book only a couple of weeks ago, but I've already reread it several times because it's a fun read and packed with information.Visually, the book is loaded with a smorgasbord of strong logo and typeface examples. This was one of the things that caught my attention at first glance, and it still makes this guide a good place to look if you need a starting point for logo concepts. There's even specific sections that cover, for example, a variety of popular icon styles (and their character) and a spread showing period typefaces from the Dark Ages to the present. The pages themselves are printed using a fine screen, so all of the vector art appears clear and crisp. The only thing that bugs me about this guide is that a lot of effort has gone into the imagery, layout, and overall presentation of the book, but the editor didn't catch that ""pallet"" (as in ""makeshift bed"") was used everywhere that ""palette"" should be. A minor error in the grand scheme of things, but one that appears consistently from cover to cover",1
"I've never heard nore bought a soundtrack by Dario before.  It was after I saw this movie that I snapped this soundtrack up at once.  Like some of the other gere greats the past few years, this comic-book inspired movie has a similar main theme which represents ""V"" and his will to fight the system.  Nat Portman's character has a softer similar sounding theme which is very soft & touching.  If anything is better than that...on the last track is the select capture from Tch. 1812 Overture that caps the actual film.    GREAT SOUNDTRACK!!",0
"It amazes me how incredibly well this 1969 western has held up after all these years. At once classically structured and satirically executed, director George Roy Hill and screenwriter William Goldman have pulled together a supremely entertaining period picture that caters to contemporary sensibilities to this day. It is to their credit that the film remains true to the characters and never gets too broad during its quickly paced 110-minute running time. The story naturally revolves around the legendary outlaws who robbed banks at the turn of the last century. Their escapades are divided roughly into three sections in the film. The first is the introductory set-up where their opposite yet complementary personalities are established. Leading the motley Hole in the Wall Gang, they ultimately pull off a train robbery with an excess of dynamite. The second part is an extended chase sequence where Butch and Sundance are chased relentlessly by a group of unknown bounty hunters.The third and final part details their escape to Bolivia where they are determined to go straight but get caught up with local bandits and find their infamous past catching up with them. It seems inconceivable to have anyone other than Paul Newman and Robert Redford in the title roles. As the more established star at the time, Newman is characteristically laconic as Butch. His innate likeability is enhanced by his rascally manner and crack comedy timing. In the more traditional gunslinger role, Redford provides the ideal partner with his flinty manner and unavoidable charisma. In between them is Katharine Ross, fresh from ""The Graduate"", who plays Etta with sensual ï¿½lan, though she does not figure in the most critical scenes. Of course, Burt Bacharach's instantly recognizable musical score is here, and while there is an anachronistic feel to such 1960's-sounding pop music over a western, it somehow works because the attitude of the film seems so modern. Even the comically romantic bicycle sequence manages to preserve its buoyancy thanks to the inane but undeniably catchy ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head"".Conrad Hall's vibrant, burnished cinematography deserves special mention as it has been preserved well in the 2006 Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD package. The rest of the two-disc package is robust though bordering on overkill, adding on to the features that were already included in the previous 2000 Special Edition DVD. Retained from that edition is the interesting combination of perspectives provided by Hill, Hall, lyricist Hal David and associate producer Bob Crawford in their joint commentary track. New is separate and equally insightful commentary from Goldman. Another holdover from the previous edition is the forty-minute vintage documentary, ""The Making of Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid"", a still terrific featurette from 1970 with participation from Newman, Goldman, Hill and Redford.There are three new documentaries - a 2005 retrospective look at the film called ""All of What Follows is True: The Making of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid""; a fact-check featurette called ""The Wild Bunch: The True Tale of Butch & Sundance""; and the somewhat repetitive ""History Through the Lens: Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid: Outlaws Out of Time"", a cumulative effort which combines elements of all the other documentaries into one ninety-minute feature. Lots of great insight is provided on the 1994 interviews with Newman, Redford, Ross, Goldman and Bacharach. A deleted scene is also included with Hill's commentary (since the audio had been lost) - it is a disposable transitional scene where Butch and Sundance are watching newsreel footage of themselves in a Bolivian theater while Etta quietly leaves to the train station. Lastly, there are trailers for eight of Newman's vintage films. This is definitely a robust package for one of the great films of the 1960's",0
"""Coming into the Country"" is a classic that every visitor to Alaska should read.  But the first two sections can be skipped by most people.  Section one, ""The Encircled River"" is about the Kobruk River, and section two, ""What they Were Hunting For"" is a funny tale of the defunct effort to establish a new Alaskan capital city.Section three, titled ""Coming into the Country"" describes the people and region of Eagle, population 100 plus a loose scattering of rural homesteaders.  The time is the late 1970s when Alaskan lands are being divided up into national parks, native american, state, federal and private lands.  McPhee seems to have interviewed about everybody in Eagle to get a cross section of views -- most of them anti-government and libertarian. He probes deep into the Alaska psyche by simply recording what people told him.    What of the homesteaders?  I admire their individuality and hardiness -- but their bulldozers and airplanes seem incompatible with living simply in the woods.  Someone once said that the greatest boon to homesteaders was food stamps; thus their lifestyle is more than a bit artificial and dependent upon there being very few people inhabiting large areas of land.  On the other hand, do the ""posey sniffers"" (as they call environmentalists) have the right to dictate to Alaskans how they conduct themselves and what they do with their land?  Would New Yorkers on Fifth Avenue resent Alaskan advice on the management of Central Park?  The struggle between the environmentalists and the Alaskans continues to this day.  In the little town of Wrangell last summer, the Greenpeace ship ""Arctic Sunrise"" paid a call and was promptly slapped with a summons for violating environmental laws.  Greenpeace fled the scene, but was convicted of failing to have an ""oil spill prevention plan,"" which seems a serious omission by an outfit that protests oil spills for a vocation.   I'd like to see an update of McPhee's book.  What's happened to the homesteaders he interviewed?  I suspect that most of them have long since abandoned their cabins and returned to civilization, possibly to be replaced by a new group seeking the solace in the wilderness that is the goal of both homesteaders and posey sniffers, each in his own way.  This is a good book of objective reporting which both groups can enjoy.         Smallchief             ",1
"For a dead man, Frank Zappa can still put out some astonishing music. This latest effort from the Zappa Family Trust is a collection of smoking guitar solos from the master of the guitar himself. Mostly recorded with his legendary 1988 touring band, Trance-Fusion sports some riveting dramatic guitar work supported by rock-solid fusion rhythm work by a big band that is nothing short of spectacular. People like to dismiss Frank Zappa as a weirdo who sings smutty songs with bizarre musical changes, but the reality is different. His guitar playing is out of this world, unlike anything else being put to CD these days, and the sound of these live recordings is lush, bountiful, and extraordinary. You can feel Terry Bozio's kick drum pulsate through your body, and hear every player's work sizzle upward through the potent brew of notes, and everything fits nicely into a jazz rock fusion framework that soars above all the current musical competition. I know this review sounds overly effusive. But if you enjoy guitar music supported by outlandishly expert musicians, then Trance-Fusion needs to be a part of your collection. NOW.",0

There were few stories that seemed  worthy of Ms. Braun's time and talents as a writer.  The great strength of  Ms. Braun's books is her hero Jim Quilleran and the amusing cast of  characters who inhabit his world.

"I've owned this charger for over a year now and It's been flawless.  Batteries seem to last longer when charged on this charger than the other 1hour charger I own.  Very fast charging and batteries are never hot after charging (hot is a sign that they are being stressed = shorter lifespan).  The original Lenmar 2000mAh batteries are still going strong and are holding their charge as well as when they were new.  Because the charger is 'smart' I will often throw the batteries in to 'top up' even when they are only half used so that I have a full charge when I'm out and about (often done in 15 minutes).  Never any signs of memory effects.  I also love the fact that it charges each battery independantly (useful for devices like FRS radios that take 3 AA batteries).  Brilliant system.

This film didnt feel to much like a Troma movie, Because it didnt have to much of the usual Comedy mixed with horror style. It was basically a straight horror movie. BUY THIS DVD",0
"I had bought the original VHS tape in 1997, but my VCR broke.  I was upset because this buns workout is great and I thought that I would not be able to find it on DVD. If you don't like to get on the floor to do excercises then this is the tape for you.  Nothing is done on the floor and your buns will be ready for full bathing suit exposure. There are three basic excercise sections 1. In-line skating, 2. Kickboxing, and 3. Ballet.  Some excercises (kickboxing section) are difficult to learn and to balance, but with time, it will be worth it.  Just do the best you can in that section.  This DVD also has an ABS section, but I have not tried it yet.  Highly recommend this Buns of Steel",0

"Femme Fatale is probably De Palma's most controversial film.  It is truly a love-it or hate-it film.  Critics were almost totally split on the film.  A lot thought it was a total piece of trash, others thought it was a masterpiece of neo-noir filmmaking.  Heck, this movie even somewhat split De Palma's most loyal fans down the middle.  One thing is for sure: Femme Fatale proved to me once and for all that Brian De Palma is one of the most fearless and talented directors that Hollywood ever has seen or ever will see.The film's opening is definitely is strongest point.  It opens with a 20-minute diamond heist at the Cannes Film Festival in France.  This sequence is low on dialogue and high on style.  De Palma does an amazing job of keeping the viewer's absolute attention to every detail (even though we still get some surprises at the end).  Rebecca Romijn-Stamos plays one of the thiefs, Laure Ash.  The heist goes wrong (don't they always?) and Laure gets away with the diamonds.  Thanks to a convenient case of mistaken identity, Laure is able to switch identities with a French woman, but not before a spying paparazzo (Antonio Banderas) takes her picture from his balcony.  The film then jumps ahead seven years, and Laure is back in Paris, but this time as a completely different person, the wife of the American Ambassador to France.  The trouble is, the photog is still there, too.  Once a photo of Laure is released, the demons from her past come to the forefront, and the movie takes us on its twisting, downhill track to a crazy, mind-blowing final 20 minutes that will either make you flip off the TV or scream, ""I love Brian De Palma!""  For me, it was the latter.I think this film is absolutely De Palma's most daring film, and one of his most interesting screenplays.  As with all De Palma's, you will either love or hate this movie, but one this is for sure: it will definitely evoke a reaction from all its viewers, and De Palma is one of the few guys who can be relied on for that these days",0
"I own lots of cookbooks (over 200) and the White Dog Cafe cookbook is one of my favorites.  I have tried about half of the book's recipes and have never been disappointed.  The recipes are interesting, using ingredients that non-professionals can find easily.  The techniques are easy and the food is very tasty.  The food is also creative and can be made (even for the first time)without a household staff of 12!  The White Dog Cafe's Black Bean Soup is the only version I really like and I have made it several times.  The social philosophy of the authors is an added bonus",1
"This is a book which should not be missed if you are interested in the Caucasuses in general and Chechnya in particular. It should be required reading for all students of Russian history and all counter terrorist experts who may not specialize in the Chechen situation. Gammer has written an eloquent, witty, compassionate and utterly fascinating book jam packed with cultural tidbits which make understandable the recalcitrant nature of the conflict between Russia and the clannish  Mountaineers. It is, also, unusual to encounter a nuanced understanding of the reception of Islam into Chechnya and how it has played out vis a vis the gazavat, evolving into jihad, in some sectors. One of my few quibbles would be that I would have liked more on family and gender relations though this is not to say that there is not valuable references to be found here. It seems to me that this book had to be written first but it is hoped that in the next, more space will be given to this underlying conflict. On the geo-political scale, Gammer aptly identified the problematic issue of pathological control, the desire to engineer 'peoples' lives and language' which inevitably fails. This is a stellar book which is sure to be come a classic.",1
Absolutely hilarious!  This poor guy has the worst luck ever all in a 12 hour period. ,0
"In Chaucer's work, 'The Canterbury Tales', perhaps the greatest of English literary works from the period of the language known as Middle English, there is one particular piece that have always stood out for me.'A Clerk ther was of Oxenford also,'This is perhaps my favourite character, as when I first read it, it seemed to epitomise what I hoped for in my own life.'That unto logik hadde longe y-go.....For him was lever have at his beddes heedTwenty bokes, clad in blak or reed,Of Aristotle and his philosophye,Than robes riche, of fithele, or gay sautrye,But al be that he was a philosophre,Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre,But al that he mighte of his freendes hente,On bokes and on lerninge he it spente,and bisily gan for the soules preyeOf hem that yaf him wherwith to scoleye........gladly wolde he lerne, and gladly teche.'Every now and then I cannot help but re-read this part of the Prologue, for a reminder of what I'm aiming for in my own life. Chaucer was son of a wine merchant, something near and dear to my heart. Chaucer was well-read, well-phrased, well-mannered, industrious in literary and legal/administrative pursuits, as I trust I will become, if not already so qualified. As one can see from the above examples, English has changed much over the past 600 years, but not so much as to make these passages unrecognisable. Compare for yourself with a modern translation, and see how much you can decipher.Chaucer is one of the first great English authors of name; most (but not all) literary output in English prior to this time was anonymous. Living in the 1300s, he held administrative posts of importance under Kings from the time of Edward III to Henry IV. Never one to shrink from spending too much money (he had to reapply for pensions and ask for advances several times in his life) or shying away from controversy (he fell out of and came back into favour several times). When he died, he was laid to rest in Westminster Abbey, in a section on the south side that has since become Poet's Corner, largely due to Chaucer, the first great English poet, having been buried there.In addition to his magnus opus, 'The Canterbury Tales', a collection of stories with prologue told by pilgrims on their journey to Canterbury (car radios and in-flight movies were rare in those days), Chaucer wrote minor poems to suit various occasions (his first record as poet comes from having written a poem as elegy on the death of John of Gaunt's first wife, Blanche, in 1369), and the major work for which he was noted for 'Troilus and Criseyde', which showed his sense of humour, power of observation and attention to detail, and keen dramatic skills in language. This work is often compared to Dante and Boccaccio, perhaps the most famous poets of the day. 'The Canterbury Tales' is actually intended to be much longer - 120 tales told by 30 pilgrims (two each on the way to Canterbury, and two each returning). As it is, there are only 24 tales plus a prologue - had it been completed, it would be by far the longest poem in the English language.There is a strong, practical side to Chaucer's writing, sophisticated yet not aloof and removed from the affairs of the world, cultured yet in tune with the better (and more interesting) aspects of the common people, too. This edition by Larry Benson is designed for those who only want the Canterbury Tales, not the other writings of Chaucer, but want a set of the complete tales and prologue from standard texts.  This comes from the Riverside Chaucer, with introductory notes explaining plot, versification, and various issues that might arise in the translation of the tales.  The indexes include one for proper names.  There is also a timeline showing Chaucer's life that is handy for students.For those who want the Canterbury Tales in good form, this is a good volume to get.  ",1

"It all started with John Malkovich. Me seeing the movie I mean, not the film itself. I was scanning through Malkovich's filmography and saw this film in their. I had heard of the film, but had no idea what it was about but I checked it out. Malkovich is close to top billing, but his role is really small...Having said that, this was an amazing film. Truly a work of art. The movie stars Sam Waterston ('Serial Mom') playing Sydney Schanberg, a New York Times columnist who heads to Cambodia on the brink of war. Bombs have been dropped, labor camps have been set up and Schanberg wants to write about all of it. When he gets there he meets Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor, who won an Oscar for the role), who becomes his friend and interpreter. Malkovich plays Schanberg's photographer Al Rockoff; His role is brief, but he leaves his mark. After Schanberg's war entraps himself and his fellow journalists, Pran saves him from being executed but is himself placed in a labor camp. The script is based on a New York Times article by Schanberg called The Death and Life of Dith Pran. When I saw that, I figured this would be a rather depressing story. Truth is, the film is quite uplifting. The choice to use John Lennon's ""Imagine"" for the final scene was perfect. Anyway, back to the synopsis...Schanberg is back in New York, while Pran slaves at the labor camp. Schanberg has no idea whether Pran is alive or dead, but doesn't give up on the idea of one day reuniting with his friend. Most films that take place in this setting, I'm not a big fan of. I'm not saying I didn't like these films, but movies like The Constant Gardener and Beyond Borders are a bit like this movie. Although, for the record, this film is way better. Having said those last two things I was surprised that I liked this film. Whether you're a fan of these kinds of movies or not, you need to see this. It's an important and uplifting movie, that no one should not see.GRADE: A",0
"I am continually amazed at the huge variation in people's tastes. Someone can give a 1 star rating and the next a 5 star rating for the same film. I can be touched by a film so deeply and yet the person sitting next to me feels nothing. I guess it proves how different we all are. &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; touched me. I would rank it amongst the best 5 films I have ever seen. The film is mysteriuos, haunting, slow paced, impecably filmed and acted. So many images remain in my mind. The woman who breaks down and has to be pacified by a tranquilizer, the haunting music associated with the witch that permeates throughout the movie, the long take as the house is burned etc etc. This is a truly great masterpiece. What a shame Tarkovsky died so young",0

When do Daniel's dreams take place chronologically?This book didn't come close.  This book has outlines of each of the books.  I can get that in almost any commentary.  This book gave cursory discriptions and discussion about each Bible book.  But, the authors did not provide enough detail to make the reading worthwhile.  That level of detail made reading a waste of time.This book is supposed to be a ""Complete Book of Bible Charts and Maps!""  It's NOT.  Even the drawings of things like to ark of the covenant are small, roughly drawn and basically unuseable.I was VERY disappointed with this book",1

"Richard Overy presents a fabulous book of insights on why World War II progressed and ended the way it did, from big ideas down to critical details. Only a small amount deals with actual battles, with exceptions for three of the most critical: Midway, Stalingrad/Kursk, and the invasion of France. His focus instead is on leadership (or lack thereof), economics, logistics, air power and bombing, the fight for control of the north Atlantic, technology, and the moral implications for the Allies and Axis.Obviously, Overy cannot pinpoint a single cause or two. All the items above were major factors. Failure on a couple of them, or more success by the Axis, could have made the difference. For example, Overy hammers at Hitler for numerous major errors, re-inforcing the conventional wisdom that smarter early leadership by the Nazis could have clinched a victory or at least a negotiated settlement. Nobody will read Overy's analysis and think that the Allies' victory was anywhere near pre-ordained or a matter of time even once the Americans joined. The Allies were both lucky and good.Overy gets closer to calling for inevitable victory in the Pacific, once the US survived Midway. (His summary of Midway is excellent.) After that, the US was dominant in so many factors, other than the fanatic resistance by Japanese soldiers, that the US was almost certain to wear down Japan even while investing only 15% in the Pacific (the number used by Overy). Therefore, Overy spends the majority of his analysis on the European theater. Unlike many western authors, Overy shows how the eastern front was far larger and more critical to the outcome. He found the right mix of battle coverage (Stalingrad, Kursk, etc.) and supporting factors in how the Nazis came to the brink of victory and the Soviets pushed back through sheer will plus rapid advancements in skill and equipment. One may argue about whether Overy's credit to Zhukov and others as individuals is justified, but that would be quibbling. His description and assessment are masterful. I learned a lot about the evolving Soviet strategy and their desperate efforts, such as packing and moving manufacturing complexes to the east under severe duress, and a population enduring hardship difficult for Americans to imagine.Another favorite example highlights the American genius for mass production and standardization, in contrast to the cultural factors that influenced German technology. The Germans' well-known talent for complex technology was unrestrained, leading to equipment that was constantly changing and was too fancy, not robust enough to handle particularly adverse conditions. Whereas the Allies were able to produce huge volumes of standard (even if simple) goods, the Germans struggled with production volumes and constant breakdowns. As Overy said, ""In the end the Soviet army proved just modern enough; but German forces were too modern for their own good.""Overy's coverage of the battle for air supremacy, including the bombing of Germany and Britain, doesn't duck from the controversy about whether it was worth it. He clearly shows that the early phases of the bombing were ineffective. Over time, however, Overy concludes that the improved capabilities were effective in damaging Germany and that the air war itself, cleansing western Europe of much of the Luftwaffe, was decisive in the invasion of France and beyond.These are some of the topics Overy examines. I highly recommend the book for anyone interested in the war beyond the personalities and the battles.",1

"I remember the first time I encountered this book.  I was a preadoptive parent and it was on the scant reading list my agency provided to look at before adoption.  It scared the heck out of me.  How could this happen?  How could someone be so hurt and filled with anger at the events that had shaped their lives?  I wanted to listen to the adoptees that said: this is not true, it's just anger and it didn't happen to me, there must be something wrong with her to have had this happen.  I wanted to be a parent and hope for the happy rosy picture that says adoption is win win....a child gets a loving family and a family gets a child to love.What I have discovered through the years of parenting is that adoption can be win-win, it can also be lose-lose and lose-win and win-lose.  And I have read this book with a new understanding this time.  There are as many outcomes as there are parent/child combinations.  What I didn't understand about Sherrie Eldridge's book the first time around was that each adoptee, birth/natural parent, and adoptive parent come to the table with different experiences and different ways to cope.  While for some, it's an easy journey, for others it is not.  That doesn't mean that one is more right than another, or someone was parented better.   It's just what it is.  And more importantly, it's what we do with it.What I have found helpful is to read about the journeys that people have had that are different from my own.  It gives me a window on a perspective that is not mine, but may very well be my children's.  It gives me a way to take a few steps in the shoes of someone else who has trod a different path than mine has taken me.  It's not right or wrong, it is the experience of the writer.  What I can do with this information is to read and learn and see if it resonates for my situation.  And I have to say that having this perspective has helped me to parent the children who have come to me.  For one of my children, loss is a part of who she is.   I didn't put it in there, it is because of who she is and the experiences she has had in her life.  For her, the loss has been life changing.   It impacts the way I parent her. And understanding her losses has given me an opportunity to reach out to her and give her the tools to help her navigate through life.  (A book that has also helped is Adoption Parenting: Creating a Toolbox, Building Connections...filled with BTDT info from parents and experts in adoption--it is a great book!) Twenty Things Adopted Kids Wish Their Adoptive Parents Knew is another tool in my adoptive parenting toolkit.  And the perspective it offers is timeless and valuable",1
" Many reviewers are clearly missing the point of how CREATIVE and valuable this work is. Ngakpa Chogyam is following Chogyam Trungpa's unique presentation of Tibetan Buddhist philosphy in an immediate phenomenological, psychological style. Both Chogyams are/were concerned with NOWNESS and Consciousness, not Opaque, Irrelevent aspects of TB. Both Chogyams are very intelligent and articulate in describing the energetic tendencies of samsaric consciousness in the context of emptiness and form. You will either get it/appreciate it or you don't. Whether they are a legitimate lineage is to miss the point. Both Chogyams are artists-psychologists who are highly creative and poetic in their endeavors and controversial because of that. This work is worth serious study and reflection. Also read, 'Wearing the Body of Visions', by Ngakpa Chogyam, as well as 'Transcending Madness,' 'Crazy Wisdom,'The Myth of Freedom' and 'Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism' by Chogyam Trungpa and you will CLEARLY understand where Ngakpa Chogyam is coming from.  Awesome Material",1

"I'm a trained English/Writing instructor, and also a homeschooling mom. This book gives me much of what I need for an intensive literature-and-composition program for my kids. The first part of the book is focused on managing a normal English class (although a teacher who followed this suggestions would have a SUPER class, I'm sure!). But homeschoolers shouldn't entirely skip this part, because if offers valuable (but wonderfully brief and clear) suggestions on the writing process, grading methods, and other tips. Part II is the treasure-trove. The has provided brief, practical plans for studying twenty different books appropriate for students in a given age group (7th and 8th grade; 9th and 10th grade; and 11th and 12th grade). For each recommended book, the author provides:- A synopsis of the story- Ideas and concepts to highlight in discussion- A ""Writing Connection"" - a paragraph or two to orient the teacher to core themes in the book- A reproducible pre-writing activity- Eight to ten well-thought-out essay questions- Four to six ""projects and activities"" related to the book- Four or five ""Curriculum Connections"" that suggest ways to connect the book study with other subject areas (science, history, and even math).Amazingly, all this is presented in the space of only four pages -- with plenty of white space left over! With all these resources you could easily spend 2-3 weeks per book while still picking and choosing to suit yourself and your student. One word of caution: parents may want to go through the synopses (or read the books) before they put them in their child's hands. The subject matter in the recommended books is challenging. Muschla's recommendations are not 'easy' books, and have powerful themes that deserve to be discussed. An advantage to homeschooling is that the teacher knows the student intimately, and knows which subject matter might not be appropriate for that child. However, I would encourage homeschooling parents to give some of these books a try, even if they seem a bit edgy and raw. If you read the book with your child and restrain yourself from speaking too quickly, you may learn a great deal about your child's growing and changing thoughts. ",1
"Duke Ellington, who spent just about every waking moment writing music, loved to assemble his orchestra in recording studios, at his own expense, and try out his musical ideas on the band, making adjustments based on what he heard. (Much of this material was recorded at the time and subsequently issued on CDs.) The first six sides on this CD, which comprise what Duke referred to as THE COMBO SUITE, are of this nature. Having just returned from a tour of Europe a week earlier, he brought into the studio 8 members of the band to work on some new compositions. The results are very interesting. The title track, which would occasionally be played in later concert appearances, is a nice blues with good solos by Johnny Hodges and Lawrence Brown. OUT SOUTH is a quiet gospel tune, while TELL ME 'BOUT MY BABY is broiling with excellent Cat Anderson on muted trumpet. Paul Gonsalves is featured on the up-tempo NEAR NORTH, and the handsome blues KENTUCKY AVENUE has good solos all around. THE COMBO SUITE is a nice addition to the Ellington repertory, and I'm glad it was recorded that day and brought out by Fantasy 18 years later.The rest of the material on this CD comes from various sessions in 1970, and some feature Wild Bill Davis on organ. All are small-group recordings; ALL TOO SOON is by a quintet that features Harold Ashby on tenor. JUST A SITTIN' AND A ROCKIN' has Norris Turney playing flute in the part usually played by the whole orchestra as the tenor player (going all the way back to Ben Webster) states the theme. It's a bit of a shock at first, but turns out very classy. This is a most enjoyable CD that Ellington fans should certainly latch on to",0

"As my family concluded our first annual Thanksgiving game of Quelf, I surveyed the table.  My mother, who turns seventy this year, had a belt tied around her head (to look like a ninja, of course).  My father, seventy-four, had a sock coming out of his shirt collar and his shoelaces were tied together.  My sister, thirty-nine, was wearing a bike helmet (the card had called for anything with a chinstrap), and her pajama sleeves hung loosely by her sides (another card had informed her that she was now ""armless"" - we had to roll the die for her after that).  Who were these people?  I have known them all my life, yet throughout this spirited game I had witnessed surprisingly novel actions: My mother pantomiming that she was wearing flippers and a snorkel while being attacked by a swarm of bees.  My father, a physician, delivering a moving eulogy for his fictitious dog ""Scooter,"" who, according to the instructions on the card, had an affinity for coleslaw and delighted in playing with large land mammals.  Never had I seen my sister slap herself on the face, turn to me and yell ""you must not defy the king!""  The four of us agreed that we have never laughed so hard, or so consistently, as we had during that hour of play.  I admit, I was skeptical before purchase.  After reading some of the reviews and viewing pictures of the box online, it had first seemed as if Quelf was some sort of wacky game that needs a certain setting, mood, or substance related enhancement in order to be fully appreciated.  This is not the case.  There are elements of the game, such as the trivia and category parts, that help Quelf to maintain its flow and keep the players grounded in authentic board-game style competition...This game sucks you in and then absolutely hammers you with random acts of creativity and humor.  Player age, gender, and personality are non-factors.  Quelf has an uncanny capacity for drawing out the best (and by ""best"", I mean the ability to make other people laugh until they nearly soil themselves) in anyone.",0

"I wish I could give this book a 0 rating. I have yet to understand why this world figures that a woman (or man) must be immoral in order to make a name for herself, or discover her soul. The only thing I enjoyed about this book is how it brought me back to a darn near picture perfect example of the immoral woman written about in the Book of Proverbs as compared to the woman of wisdom. The main character was so selfish in this book. I did feel sorry for the character because of her lost state but, ultimately I found my self very detached from this woman. This book is more about being blind and decieved rather than ""awakened."" I can now conculed I am not a fan of Mrs. Chopin or her incoherent character Edna! I understand the concept of equality for women, but come on, is this piece of literature really desired as a voice for feminism!

If you go to Alaska, all you need are the proper clothes and this book",1
"I really enjoyed this light reading, and I admire the author's youthful outlook on life.  I strongly believe that if everyone were to read this book and apply its simple principles, the world would be a better place and at peace. ",1
"I could feel my brain stretching as I read this book.  It is philosophical but readable.The main focus of this book is, as implied by the title, the notion that there are several qualitatively different ways that organisms adapt to their environments -- it isn't simply a matter of one organism being ""more intelligent"" than another.  He presents a succession of clear models, increasing in sophistication, for how an organism's behavior can be modulated to improve its chances of reproductive success.  I had never thought about these qualitatively different ""levels of sophistication,"" but they make perfect sense to me -- kind of an ""Aha!"" experience.I liked it",1
"Once upon a time, the only video games that had soundtracks worth buying separately were Japanese RPGs.  Occasionally, a Western game would come along with a great compilation soundtrack (see the Grand Theft Auto series), but for the most part, music composed specifically for games was unable to stand alone as an artistic work.Fast forward to the end of 2004.  UbiSoft was making the third installment of their popular Splinter Cell series, and the need for some creepy, paranoid music naturally arose.  Some inspired soul (whose name is lost to history) suggested that the job be offered to electronic artist Amon Tobin, perhaps thinking that his bass-heavy groovalicious style would adapt well to stealth based gameplay.  The Powers That Be agreed, and gave Amon a lot of money with which to score their still-developing game.When Amon returned after completing the soundtrack, the results were better than anyone expected.  CHAOS THEORY struck a perfect balance between spooky ambience and jackhammer beats, often shifting rapidly between the two, but throughout it all there was an undeniable sense of beauty which did not exist in spite of the chaos but rather arose from it.  Indeed, this chaotic beauty led many who listened to make comparisons to another artist, Aphex Twin.But CHAOS THEORY was much more than an Aphex knock-off.  Amon had put UbiSoft's money to good use, hiring an all-star lineup of studio players to make the soundtrack the best it could be.  These studio session gave CHAOS THEORY a very organic feel that is usually missing from video game soundtracks, and was definitely absent from Aphex Twin's 2001 album, DRUQKS.The album started off with ""The Lighthouse,"" and while it wasn't necessarily the best track off the album, it was still pretty darn close, with a jerky bass riff that immediately created a sense of paranoia in the listener.  It was the perfect setup to an album which cultivated a wide range of emotions, most of them disturbing.  CHAOS THEORY never really let up on these emotions, instead, Amon simply switched from one emotion to another, from paranoia to panic to uneasiness and back to paranoia, often within a single track.All involved with the project were so pleased that it was decided that Amon's soundtrack would be released several months ahead of the actual game.  The reason for this was simple: where most consumers hear music in a game and then would desire to purchase the soundtrack, hearing this soundtrack actually made people want to play the game.  Reviewers across the land encouraged everyone they met, even those with no interest in video games, to purchase the album, and all who heard the free MP3 of ""The Lighthouse"" provided on amazon.com were more than willing to fork over the cash to hear the rest of CHAOS THEORY, with the result that Amon Tobin became obscenely wealthy, and nobody payed any attention to the drivel that MTV played anymore.And they all lived happily ever after",0

"... And it was great fun. What pushed me to go and see that concert was  the presence of Bobby Parker and Gatemouth's band, which I had heard to be a real treat (with Joe Krown on Keyboards!). I wasn't really eager to listen to some torrential solos from Carlos and Buddy Guy but at the end my expectations were satisfied: Parker was great, Gatemouth's band swung like crazy and Buddy Guy made a remarkable acoustic opening before stumblin' in his usual heavy-metal blues set. Nonetheless, Carlos wasn't much intruding others' own style and his performance, especially with Gatemouth and Buddy Guy was totally acceptable.  Actually Carlos grew up as a Blues guitar player, just check Bloomfield/Kooper Live Adventures ..",0

I have read many books on hunting the whitetail, and none come close to delivering the way this book does.  I  was particularly intrigued by Greg's strategies and ideas concerning  rub-lines.  I also liked the fact that Greg is not a professional hunter  but a guy with a regular job and regular responsibilities.  This made the  book a better read, as I felt Greg could more easily relate specific  strategies to meet my needs.  He didn't dissapoint",1

"Hardcover books are these days just glued together masses of paper. Some results: the binding isn't durable, the pages don't open well or the binding breaks if you make them open well (would you like to pay 20 to 40 bucks for something that doesn't last you more than one reading time, if that (depending on how well you want the pages to open), and isn't very comfortable to read in any case? Modern publishers seem to think that you would). However, there are a few exceptions, the Night Shade Books editions of Dunsany's Jorkens tales constitute one such happy exception.This is the third and last volume, and is accompanied by a foreword written by Michael Dirda. Dirda mentions Dunsany's early biblical flavored tales, and says that he always tires of their utter artificiality after a few pages. I found that statement curious at best, as Dunsany has himself stated that he grew up with the King James Bible, and that consequently the style of the King James Bible was long the only style which came naturally to him.Otherwise the contents of this book are excellent. The introduction by Joshi is of the usual high standard expected from Joshi, and the Jorkens tales are each unique little gems of literary invention and execution.Don't miss the other two volumes",1

"We had the pleasure of spending two days with Tyler working on the premier season of his ""Tyler's Ultimate"" series.  It's hard to believe that at that time he was celebrating two things:  the upcoming publication of his first cookbook and the installation of his new plasma TV.  With the publication of his third book, Tyler continues to bring his simple techniques to the kitchens of the average at-home cook.  No, it's not strictly based on the Series, but Tyler's Ultimate carries through on the show's theme with Tyler's unique twists on popular dishes.  All of the recipes work great and are easy to follow.  It's obvious that everything here has been painstakingly tested, as Tyler says ""to the last grain of salt.",1
"Peter feels he has been brushed off by his father yet again--and he has been. He's been waiting for his birthday treat for months, but his father always has business meetings and is too busy to spend time with him. His mother is off working in Los Angeles, far away from Peter and his father in London.  The morning Peter and his father fight about it again, Margrit, the Au Pair, takes Peter with her to visit her friends out in the country. These friends have a daughter, Kate, who is about Peter's age, twelve. Kate's father takes the two of them, plus Kate's dog, Molly, to the lab where he works. Kate and Peter end up chasing Molly through the halls--a small thing that ends up being very important. One minute, they're running through the halls of the lab. The next minute, Kate and Peter, along with an antigravity machine that one of Kate's father's colleagues has been working on, have been transported back in time to a grassy hillside in 1763.Before long, they've met two very different men of that time. The first is the Tar Man, who steals the antigravity machine, which could very well be the key to getting back to the present. The second is Gideon, an enemy of the Tar Man, who decides to help the two children from the future.Before long, Kate and Peter are on an adventure, headed to London to recover the antigravity machine and get back to their homes and families. On their way, they will encounter highwaymen, make friends (including Gideon), and learn a lot about that time in history--the good and the bad. Back in present-day England, Peter's parents are frantic with worry. Kate's father has figured out that the machine has something to do with their disappearance--but when ghostly images of the children appear dressed in clothing from the eighteenth-century, it becomes clear that this can't be shared with the public; who knows what destruction could result from the misuse of time travel technology?The parallel storylines--the children's quest to get back to the present and Kate's father's struggle to bring them back--go together quite nicely. The jumping back and forth is not as confusing as it could have been, and both parts of the story are extremely well-written. The characters are realistic, the storylines interesting, the history fascinating, and, well, every aspect of this book brilliant! The cover is very unique and will draw readers right in. The story inside will not disappoint them, either! GIDEON THE CUTPURSE is the first in a trilogy, and I can't wait for the next two books!Reviewed by:  Jocelyn Pearc",1

"Dr. Gaby's little book does the public a great service in discussing the importance of magnesium for maintaining your health. However, a more retailed book on the importance of magnesium for health is Dr. Carolyn Dean's book The Miracle of Magnesium. Magnesium deficiency is a significant factor -- often the major factor -- in many severe illnesses including heart attacks and other forms of heart disease, high blood pressure, asthma, anxiety and panic attacks, depression, fatigue, diabetes, migraines and other headaches, osteoporosis, insomnia, and most cases of muscular problems. Unfortunately, the majority of Americans are deficient in magnesium to some degree and many are severely deficient. Because magnesium deficiency is largely overlooked by orthodox medical doctors, millions of Americans suffer needlessly from the foregoing ailments or are having their symptoms treated with expensive drugs (which often have unpleasant or dangerous side effects) when they could be cured with magnesium supplementation. While I recommend Dr. Gaby's book, I recommend even more highly Dr. Dean's more comprehensive (but easy to read) book The Miracle of Magnesium. Getting the right level of magnesium can not only mitigate a large number of seemingly-unrelated ailments, it may save your life",1
"About the book: Life is slowly returning to normal at Heartland. Amy continues doing the daily chores at Heartland, but without her boyfriend, Ty. Ty is still in a coma at the hospital from a tornado that hit heartland in the previous book. Heartland has a mustang stallion arriving, and Amy is excited. She never got to work with a horse quite like that before, and she cant wait to get started. But when she does get started, the stallion, Dazzle, finds it difficult to warm up to Amy. She realizes she's in for a long haul with this horse. Ty eventually recovers and forms a bond with Dazzle. My Opininon: Awesome book, awesome series! For horse lovers all around the world! And i know the reading level says ages 9-12, but im 16 and i STILL read this series. I've been a loyal fan since book #1 came out (Coming Home). I recommend this book and all the others in the series to any horse lover. Oh yeah, and before i forget: This series is ending after book #20 (Always there).

"While The Get Up Kids and Dashboard lure in all these &quot;emo&quot; bandwagon kids, Vagrant Records is quietly putting out amazing releases like this one as well.  Hey Mercedes may not be as distinctive sounding as Braid, but they have put out a more coherent album than Braid ever did.  This is catchy, driving rock with captivating angular guitar lines.  The songwriting is very tight, with every aspect from the lyrics to the basslines contributing to the total statement of the music.  There's not a ton of variety here, but the band does what they do well.  &quot;Frowning Of A Lifetime&quot; and &quot;Our Weekend Starts On Wednesday&quot; are standout cuts, but every track grows on you over time.  If you miss the mid 90's midwestern emo sound, here's the perfect band for you, with some good old rock and roll thrown in to keep it interesting",0
"After reading this book, I have a deeper understanding of the basic development levels and learning abilities of students.  Taking the principles presented by many well-known psychologists and Jesus -- the Master Teacher -- &quot;Created to Learn&quot; is a thorough compilation of information that transformed my approach to teaching based on the learner's needs and abilities.  The &quot;Discipler's Model&quot; introduced in this book is a revolutionary, functional basis for monitoring teaching techniques within the classroom for flexible, balanced and productive learning sessions.   The book provided priceless insight, application and examples for effective teaching techniques for learners in every level of development -- from birth to seniors.

"_After Liberalism:  Mass Democracy in the Managerial State_ by Paul Gottfried is a very powerful and important book which shows specifically how a discontinuity existing between nineteenth century liberalism and its twentieth century version has made possible the rise of a ""managerial state"".  Such a state has made self determination an impossibility, given the rise of a managerial elite to safeguard the public from its own ""authoritarian"" tendencies.  Gottfried traces the corruption and discontinuity in liberalism to such figures as Jean Jacques Rousseau (who felt that man must be ""forced to be free""), John Stuart Mill (who ended up advocating socialist policies), and especially John Dewey - all of whom abandoned the free market principles of original liberals.  The influence of Dewey among the educational establishment cannot be underestimated.  In the twentieth century the two world wars brought out a conflict between three separate types of state:  the fascist state of Mussolini (which had ""gone beserk"" allying itself with Adolf Hitler), the communist state of Josef Stalin, and the modern managerial/welfare state brought about through New Deal legislation by FDR.  During the war, the communists joined the side of the Allies and destroyed fascism, only later to die a death of their own subsequently that century.  This leaves us today with the managerial state, which seeks to spread a ""global democratic faith"" throughout the world, while negating and containing the influences of traditional sources of community, particularly religion.  The new state is pluralistic and multiculturalist (meaning that any friction that arises between different races and ethnic groups must be curtailed in alignment with the ""moralistic"" teachings of the managerial elite).  Also, the elite seek to redistribute income by means of democracy and stoking the flames of class warfare and envy.  In the United States in particular, but even more so in the European nations, the nation has been coopted by elites as a global location for massive immigration from the third world (justified by appealing to the rhetoric of ""human rights"", invented by the New Class precisely for this purpose).  Any attempt at dissent from the dominating paradigm is shouted down as ""insensitivity"" or worse as outright ""fascism"" - a term which is consistently abused and used to stigmatize all those who adhere to traditional notions of self government.  According to Gottfried, both socialist Left and neoconservative ""Right"" adhere strongly to these principles regarding them as near articles of faith because they allow the two dominant parties of the elite to maintain their power.  Gottfried also points to a Jewish-Puritanical influence which has sought to contain dissent, particularly through moralism (which amounts to preaching an anti-racist, sensitivity-based social gospel), and shows how all beliefs contrary to this value system are deemed to be a product of ""mental illness"", thereby giving a therapeutic role to the elite.  Such a case is particularly emblematic of Adorno's post-World War II studies in the ""authoritarian personality"".  With the rise of political correctness in the university system, coupled with a racist national policy of affirmative action, which can be arbitrarily extended, education has been subverted and all means of dissent have been stifled.  Amazingly however, the populace does not support generally the goals of the elite, which has led many who are particularly disturbed by New Class social engineering to appeal to direct democracy.  Gottfried also shows how populist resistance to the managerial state has built up and found expression in movements both in the United States and Europe.  For example, Gottfried cites former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, who appealed to the tradition of an isolationist, nationalist ""Old Right"" as well as traditional Catholicism, and the National Front of Le Pen in France which sought to deal effectively with the immigration problem for France.  Also, Gottfried notes that ""postmodernist rightists"" such as Alain de Benoist in France successful criticize the current state, despite disgusting attempts by postmodernist leftists such as Jacques Derrida to entirely censor them.  Indeed, Gottfried provides several examples of precisely how ""anti-hate legislation"" is used as a weapon of tyranny by the elite managerial class to maintain their power.  Unfortunately, while populist resistance does exist, it has also been severely marginalized.  Gottfried seems unable to fully predict the future of the managerial state, though he obviously supports populist resistance and secessionary movements.  One issue that remains important though I believe is not fully dealt with by Gottfried is how to rectify calls for a completely free market with cultural conservativism and restoration of tradition.  Afterall, a completely free market would presumably have no restrictions on such things as drugs, abortions, pornography, or prostitution, things which would have to be prevented by appeals to traditional morality and religion.  Also, it is difficult to see how such a thing could avoid falling into outright barbarism.  In sum, however, while the future for democratic liberalism and self-determination looks bleak, given the rise of an elite class who intend to enforce their values on all citizens, populist resistance is possible, and is perhaps the only way towards counter-revolution.",1
"I've been looking for this sort of book.  I'm just starting to get into building, and this book offers excellent step-by-step instructions for building a steel-string or classical guitar from scratch.  It definitely leans toward traditional methods, which i like a lot.  For example, there is little discussion of spraying finishes, but a lengthy description of the technique of flowing lacquer with a brush.  Lots of good pictures and diagrams, and the text is well-written and very understandable to someone with a basic working knowledge of guitar construction.  Highly recommended",1

The book is effectively exhaustive (but not exhausting in the least - including reviewing, cookbook writing, recipe writing and fiction - as well as non-fiction memoir. It was so relevant!

"Do you enjoy a good scary story that weaves elements of science and horror yet stays traditional without too much techno slang? If yes, then this is the book for you. In The Pink Room, talented author Mark LaFlamme takes cosmology, quantum mechanics, and the string theory and mixes them with the supernatural to create a compelling scenario that will both pull at your heart strings and chill your blood.The story begins as the protagonist, well-known horror author Jonathan Cain, moves for the summer to a mysterious Second-Empire-styled house bordered by woods in the small town of Mulberry, Maine. Though most believe that the author is there to write, Cain has his own hidden agenda. For a short time, the house used to be the home of the world's top physicist Theodore Currie, who had built it himself following some very detailed and strange specifications, complete with the turret tower--or the `pink room'--which happens to be an exact replica of his little daughter's room before she died. Currie also had a hidden agenda--he believed he could bring back his beloved little girl. That is, until his dead body was found filled with bites in the woods nearby the house...Now, Cain is sure he can succeed at what Currie failed, and that is to bring his beloved Kimberly back from the dead and make her stay....The Pink Room is one of those books you won't like to read alone at night. It will make you look over your shoulder and go jumpy. The little town, the dense woods, and especially the house all add to create an excellent atmosphere of darkness and threat. The novel touches the reader intellectually and emotionally, making it all the more terrifying. Though LaFlamme uses the science to add depth, he doesn't let it get in the way of the story with too much heavy vocabulary. The pace is fast, the characters' motivations real, and the suspense doesn't let down. LaFlamme has a real talent for knowing what resides in the mind of the horror author. This novel will be thoroughly enjoyed by fans of the genre, as well as by horror authors themselves. Highly recommended. ",1
"I'm happy with my grill.  Putting it together wasn't that hard.  It took me under an hour also, but one thing to note is that when putting on the right bar with the container make sure the container is placed properly before you completely jam in the bar or else it will be very difficult to remove the bar and properly place the container.  The grilling was great, flames were consistent.  Cleaning is a pain though , but I think thats a pain for all grills. ",0

Over and above any other education tool I have bought for her, she goes for it first.  When taking long car trips, it goes with her.  Rainy days she can't play outside, she takes it to her room.  Very educational & she has learned a lot, especially with the foreign language tutor (Spanish, French, Italian & Porteguese). It has also helped with her keyboarding skills which are very important at her school.  She loves beating each level and seeing how high she can go.

"Unlike other dance compilations, which are little more than cheesy K-Tel-like collections of played-to-death top 40 tunes, Dimitri digs deep and pulls together some rarely heard grooves for this fabulous double CD.  The first disc features mid-tempo grooves from the likes of Lil' Louis, the long forgotten Imagination, and the late Gwen Guthrie.  The second disc offers more uptempo, disco-oriented numbers suitable for any dancefloor.  The highlight, I think, is the finale: a version of ""Don't Leave Me This Way"" by Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes.  Whether you want music to chill to or to spark up a party, you cannot go wrong with this excellent disc",0
"Let's be real here, folks; you won't learn a lotta these songs any other way than to buy this book.  And they're not even transcribed by someone else, Victor himself wrote out the pieces so you know they're accurate.  I transcribed ""Norwegian Wood"" by watching his hands on the Bass Day video and warped the tape because I rewound & paused it so much.  If only this had been available then, I wouldn't have had to spend another $25 on the DVD....Seriously though, if you're an avid Wooten fan you'll be pleased, several of his more difficult songs are in here.  I think ""The Sinister Minister"" solo has been long awaited, as well as ""U Can't Hold No Groove"" and ""Amazing Grace"".  I tried to knock out ""The Vision"" for a while but now I don't have to!  You won't learn anything revolutionary about his technique, but if you follow Vic closely you know the tricks already.  You're limited by the fact that he plays so fast you can't figure out the notes.  No longer!I definitely think that ""Me And My Bass Guitar"" should have been in here, but I've got enuff songs to learn for now without tackling that one",1
"It had been quite a while since I had last read Crichton (his Dino books I believe), and I had forgotten just how smart he can be, both in style and substance. Crichton doesn't just tell the story of a great caper (and does so quite well), he also conducts a worthwhile cultural investigation thereof. The introduction to the book is invaluable, setting the Victorian stage with its promise of progess through new technolgies and exploring why this robbery is called ""Great"" when the amount of money involved was not unprecedented. Throughout the narrative, Crichton insinuates a primer on criminology, both modern and 19th-century. The well-performed audio book version offers the bonus of hearing not only the various British dialects, but also the fabulous criminal argots. - Sean Scheidere",1

Thank goodness for ""Bungalow Kitchens"" which will HOPEFULLY teach people that OLD doesn't automatically mean - RIP IT OUT and begin again.

"Professor Benson's book is very interesting and excite. Good thoughts and insights in criminal justice failures. Benson advocates  free market administration of crime and punishment as solution. The question in my  opinion is: what we have to avoid ? Criminal justice failures or market  rules ? What seems a good ideia, maybe is the wrong way and will cause more  problems than solutions. Anyway, you can't be pro  or against it without   this excellent book",1
Great book and easy read...I couldn't put it down!  I love her entire collection,1

"Doctors and clinical professors at the UCLA School of Medicine, Arthur L. Wisot and David R. Meldrum have expertly collaborated to create a comprehensive and thoroughly ""reader friendly"" 360-page introductory guide to In Vitro Fertilization and other assisted reprouction techniques. Intended especially to educate those considering such fertility procedures, Conceptions & Misconceptions covers common causes of infertility, tests that infertile couples seeking treatment need to undergo, the risks and preparations needed for multiple births, alternative treatments for infertility, and much more. A straightforward, down-to-earth ""must-read"" for any couple seeking information on this often difficult or painful subject.",1
"This outstanding work may be considered fiction by some and ridiculous by others. Those that DO think that have never examined in depth the JFK assassination, the CIA's secret teams, bank scandals, drug and weapons smuggling, or the overt and covert efforts by our government to control the governments of Central and South American countries. Daniel Hopsicker names names, and uses sources where possible. Even the named sources feared for their lives, as they were actively involved in the government sponsored scandals of the 60's, 70's, and 80's. I have found through independent research, verification of many instances that are related here. This book takes us full circle, from the 1955 introduction of Barry Seal to David Ferrie, to the Mena Arkansas cocaine and weapons smuggling base that was still operating just a few short years ago. It explores in depth the story of CIA affiliated heroin and cocaine smuggling to pay for other covert activites, including political assassinations. It has been suspected for years that some of those named in this book, who are current politicians(and one cable TV news talk show host), were involved in more than arming the Contras. Mr Hopsicker has revealed those who were involved in activities contrary to the law and the Constitution, and should be in prison for life instead of being in high government positions or hosting news shows. The literary style of this book makes it an easy read, although there are some instances where further editing could have been done(ie, spelling and grammar mistakes). If you are concerned over the past and current actions of our government and its covert agencies, when you finish Barry and the Boys, you will be outraged, and rightfully so",1

"Hello, diligent Bible readers! I am a young  Christian girl and I come from country  where there was recently a taboo on Bibles and all Biblical literature.

We have spent a lot of time coloring together, and having good books like these make that time an enjoyable way to bond with your children, while teaching them the value of prime colors and staying in the lines. :",1
Remember the movies we used to see where you went away feeling good about what you saw?  This is one of the rare ones they have made recently where the good guys are (not necessarily wearing white hats) obvious and the bad guys (not necessarily wearing black hats) are always on their good guy's heels.

"I bought this book for a 12 yr old but decided to read it first before offering it to her. I'm glad I did. No one should read this book. The first line of this book is the reason I bought it but it went downhill from there. The history lesson was in no way applicable to the book. A story of teenagers in the '70's , the book was rife with drug abuse, family abuse, infidelity, brutality and suicide. I have absolutely no positive feelings about this book. I threw it in the trash when I finished with it.I'm frankly surprised that it got good reviews. Were we reading the same book",1

"This is a very good, easy read, that kept my attention from cover to cover. Briefly, the story is about a Father and preteen Daughter who take a walk in the snowy woods one afternoon and find a newborn baby left there to die in a sleeping bag. The book unfolds the mystery of who the parents are, why she was left there and what ultimately happens to the baby. You will not be diappointed by this page turner",1
"I know Toni Morrison fans may not agree with me but ""Love"" is a real flop - at least in my opinion. The book was so boring that I could not get past the first 2 pages of the very first chapter. I couldn't get into the introduction either, so I decided to by-pass it. I read the same two pages over and over again for two days on my hour and a half commute home. It was so slow....and she had to explain every single detail about every single person or object. I couldn't take it. I'm going to give the book to one of my co-workers......she's going to attempt to read it. I'm really not trying to be mean or overly critical because I know that she's an excellent writer. I just wanted to express my view. And my view is to focus on another one of her books. ",1
"Terrific. I married into a family with a teenage stepdaughter.  I had no children before that. This  book has quickly become my most trusted companion.  Just being able to refer back to the three rules - stay safe, keep in touch, and show respect - with my daughter has given both of us a firm place to work from.  It's an enormous help in my dealings with her version of the truth, my too frequent need to control her, her good and bad friends and what she does with them, and keeping respect for the house, family and each other.  Wow.  Indispensable",1
"&quot;A&quot; is excellent and that's what this book truly is.  This was a great book that explored two diverse cultures mingling in love, work, family, religion, aging, power and secrets.  It's a vacation to China without actually going.  The proverbs, poems and phrases written within the story will stay with you forever.  It's so meaningful and will provide a psychological balance for any one.  If you are Chinese or Jewish this is a &quot;required reading&quot;!  Although, I am a native Californian who was brought up as a Roman Catholic.  My ancestry is from Spain and I clearly found some Jewish roots in my mothers' anscestors.  And so, this book offered some answers to questions that I've always had in the back of my mind.  In the end, you'll learn that, today, we are a world of diverse peoples' who must work together lovingly and happily.  There is a great love story intertwined in this wonderful novel, too.  it was a great reminder of how the peoples of our past have blood-lined the present populations while we will, henceforth, be a part of future generations",1
"Without a doubt, the best season of Seaview.  The black and white photography enhances the darker themes of Season One.  Incredible monsters.  Great special effects.  Paul Sawtell's wonderful theme.  And surprisingly, some very good writing.  It's very interesting to see how the Cold War is depicted.  The acting is very good.  Many episodes emphasize the interpersonal relationships of the officers and crew.  A couple of years ago, Space, the Sci-Fi channel in Canada ran all four seasons of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.  Only season one stood up to modern scutiny.  This is the one to have in your DVD  collection.  If you like Season One of Seaview, you might also like the original Outer Limits.         ",0

"Louise Glï¿½ck explores the complex relationship between God, humans, and the natural world with startling emotional depth in The Wild Iris, her sixth collection. Far from the strained and occasionally awkward lines and language of her previous books, these poems strive for and usually master an elegant lyricism in the imagined voices of wildflowers; of God manifest in wind, light, and changing seasons; and of a woman who struggles to find evidence of God while laboring in a garden in a cold climate. In poems most often titled ""Matins"" and ""Vespers,"" the human voice expresses fear, frustration, and love, while ""checking / each clump for the symbolic / leaf"" in the garden and entertaining the apprehension that God, the addressed ""you"" of these poems, ""exist[s] / exclusively in warmer climates...."" Plants, most often wildflowers, counter these prayers, presenting a view more eternal for the accelerated brevity of their lives. Glï¿½ck's gift in these poems is a capacity for lyric eruption coupled with emotional restraint. The voices are passionate but never hysterical; plants and God chide humans, as in the poem above, for their apparently willful ignorance, but the criticism never reads as self-pity. These poems grapple honestly and successfully with questions of ultimate reality, not sheering away from critical self-assessment nor veering into a merely postured piety. They sing and praise and renew with successive readings",1
"I found this book to be a quick, entertaining, well-organized, and useful resource in my quest to bring light and space to my home. It's full of practical guidance, and one of the best tips I received was the concept of trading time with friends to clear spaces, move items out of the house that never seem to make it past the garage, or run errands that are just no fun to do by myself. Most of all... it's nice to know that so many other people feel the same way about their clutter, and are facing the same issues as a result of it. Definitely a keeper, and a great gift for the clutter-challenged",1

"Fanny Burney was a big influence on Jane Austen, but she has significant differences. Burney was an urban sophisticate, sexually aware, and with a taste for slapstick humor--and far less sentimental.The beginning of Evelina is a little hard to get through, but once the title character appears it will have been worth it. Evelina is a country girl who comes to the big city and makes every possible faux pas. Along the way she faces near incest, a bitch of a grandmother, other embarrassing relatives, near rape, clinging prostitutes, and a mischievous monkey. The book is full of unforgettable scenes that stick with you long after you close the cover.But for all the humor, the book is also moving as Evelina it traces Evelina's moral growth. ",1

"Alex Haley's moving saga of his family's history and his own journey to find their ""roots"" continues to thrill decades after its publication. From Kunta Kinte's childhood in Africa to the horror of American slavery, his descendents' experiences into the first years of black freedom and segregation, to Alex's own final triumph as he finds his long-lost, legendary ancestor in The Gambia, the reader is alternately moved from tears to rage to cheers.I first read this book and saw the miniseries in its first run when I was 12. It was the very first time someone understood the deep need for identity that I, an adopted child, carried. My ethnic heritage was unknown; the adoptive family became angry when I asked and didn't understand ""why you even care about that. So what?"" I wept when, in the show, Alex triumphantly shouts, ""I have found you, Kunta Kinte!""Decades later, I reunited with my family and began tracing my own roots. I was very proud to discover that, like me, Alex Haley is also a descendent of Captain Thomas Graves of Virginia. Rest in peace, my distant cousins of his novel. You are still very much loved and respected by generations of readers. Five star",1
"Tony Robbins is the modern day king of life transformation! If you haven't been exposed to him, you're missing out on your maximum health and fitness potential.I must admit years ago, I was completely averse to his message and his info-mercials. I think it was a mixture of fear to change and lack of trust pointed at the particular media. I couldn't stand the larger than life motivational speaker that I saw on late night TV.A friend finally talked me into going to a weekend seminar and the skeptic in me was shooed away in just 4 days. The information he teaches creates flat-out success.I had no idea I would be walking on hot coals, indentifying my hang ups, or even creating a clear and motivating action plan for the future (5, 10 and 20 years out). Plus, I never thought I would actually enjoy it!Tony's work has exponetially expanded how I work with people to help them realize their health and fitness goals. I've used his techniques as well as other Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) models to create massive change in my clients' belief systems--as well as my own. I think the major aspect of his work is to take massive action (which is actually borrowed from Jim Rohn). Massive action is the key to any extreme success and Tony gives you the tools to be able to make huge leaps over and over again.This book is not for the weak of heart! If don't want to succeed massively and live all your dreams, please don't buy it!If you are ready to make huge progress toward some of your dreams, then this book is definitely one you should have in your self-help library.

"The VHS tape ""Adam Ant: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone"" includes videos of 13 songs from Adam and the Ants made between the years 1980-1985. Songs include:1.Kings of the Wild Frontier2.Dog Eat Dog3.Antmusic4.Stand and Deliver5.Prince Charming6.Ant Rap7.Goody Two Shoes8.Friend or Foe9.Desperate But Not Serious10.Puss N' Boots11.Strip12.Apollo 913.Vive Le RockWhile Kings of the Wild Frontier is performed in the studio, the other 12 songs are music videos. Several of the videos are based around popular fairy tales, and these themes are perfect for Adam Ant's flair for theatrics. Who can forget Adam Ant as a highwayman or as a medieval knight? Prince Charming is perhaps the most elaborate music video and includes Diana Dors as the Fairy Godmother--with flashes of Adam Ant dressed as Clint Eastwood, Alice Cooper, Rudolf Valentino, and Marlon Brando. The music videos allow Adam Ant to show his acting ability, and he really hams it up at times--once even standing next a huge bodybuilder. Fans will remember these videos from MTV, and it's great to see them again compiled together in this 50 minute VHS tape. While the images are not crisp and clear, the quality is not bad (the first sequence, Kings of the Wild Frontier, is the poorest quality). There are also a lot of good close-ups. So here's Adam Ant once more--with all his wild energy, and zest for life. Will there be a DVD release? Let's hope so, but in the meantime, this VHS tape is staying in my collection--displacedhuma",0

"At many points, J.L. Austin's How to do Things with Words reads more like a linguistic textbook than a philosophy text. Whether you count this as a benifit or a distraction will depend on your disposition (it certainly beats reading Kant), but whatever your views on the subject, the work is a useful introduction to Speech Act Theory. How to do Things with Words examines a part of language that philosophy has traditionaly ignored, what he dubs the performative utterance. There are certain instances in language where to say something is do perform the very act you say, promising being the perinial example. If I say, under ordinary circumstances, &quot;I promise to do x&quot; then I have promised to do x. Using this seemingly magical fact as his starting point, Austin goes reach profound conclusions about the nature of language and philosophy. Though the tasks Austin sets out to accomplish are largely left uncompleted (he himself admits this) the book will give you the grounding you need to pursue other works in the field, such as those of Searle or Grice. Happy reading",1

"One of the most controversial movies ever made, this early 1970s' masterpiece cemented the reputations of Jack Nicholson and Mike Nichols, proved that Art Garfunkel can act, gave Candice Bergen her big break, and turned Ann-Margret into a serious actress. Initially, ""Carnal Knowledge"" was greeted with mixed reactions, but over time has been considered groundbreaking in its frank portrayal of sexual relationships between two womanizing friends over a nearly 30 year period.The film starts off in college, where two friends name Jonathan (Nicholson) and Sandy (Garfunkel) are roommates who dote on sex and nothing else. When Sandy meets Susan (Bergen) at mixer, he is immediately smitten with her, as is Jonathan, who takes her under his own wing. A few years go by as we see Sandy become involved with Jennifer (Carol Kane). Finally, Jonathan falls in love with the beautiful, and, yes, busty Bobbie (Ann-Margret, who deservedly got an Oscar nomination for her role). Their relationship becomes rougher as years go by, culminating in one of Nicholson's greatest fits of rage ever, matched by Ann's emotional breakdown as she begs him to marry her. The film seems to be very crowded, but the plot unfolds so smoothly, you never get a sense of ""gosh, I wanna shut this off because I don't understand it"", since every storyline in it grabs you and never lets go.The performances in this film are perfect. Nicholson gives one of his best performances ever as Jonathan, while Ann-Margret gives what may well be her single greatest performance of her career. It was great to see these two perform together, as Nicholson is my favorite actor and Ann my favorite actress. The two play off each other so well that they make the film watchable for their chemistry alone. Garfunkel was a perfect choice to play Sandy. Everyone may know him as one half of Simon & Garfunkel, but watching him play the part, he embodies it so well you can't imagine anyone playing the role. Though she leaves the movie pretty early, Candice Bergen did a superb portrayal of Susan, and Carol Kane was great as Jennifer. Rita Moreno does not appear until the last scene, but she really does the make the most of her screen time.""Carnal Knowledge"" is a cinematic masterpiece that belongs in any dvd collectio. Do not hesitate in purchasing this movie. It is a must have",0
"As usual, this is an excellent continuation of the John Rain saga, the Japanese-Caucasion assassin emotionally blunted by the war in Vietnam evolving into a detail oriented killer. They say that God is in the details but Rain turns his back on that thought. Rain's calling card is he won't kill women and children (a caveat that plays an important role in this assignment) and he wants the root of the assignment, not the front man.Here he is reunited with Dox, his earlier associate to replace Harry, and they get along favorably. I appreciated Mr. Eisler's restraint in making another ""buddy book"" involving silly humor while they clean off the night scopes of their sniper rifles. Yes, there is a little humor but Eisler pulls it back in.We also see Delilah, the Mossad agent and her role as the perfect foil for Rain, both in his need to trust her as well as her moral grounding.When a mission goes bad she helps him find solid ground on which to continue. I certainly hope that we see Dox and Delilah again, although it wouldn't have to be in the next rain storm.My only concern is that Mr. Eisler doesn't keep turning out the same formula for ages. Lucas Davenport and John Sandford come to mind. Good stuff. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebur",1

this si without a doubt the most moving of all the disney princess movies I've seen. The ending of this movie had me in tears.

"In recent months, I read (at least in part) about ten books on set theory, of different levels and styles. Goldrei's book is by far the best on my list. Goldrei has the talent of presenting a fairly difficult and abstract material in a friendly style, with abundant explanations, solved exercises, illustrations, and illuminating comments. I can highly recommend this book as a first reading on set theory, whether for self-study or as a supplementary text for a course on the subject. For the interested readers of this review, here is how I rank some of the other books I've read: Stoll is definitely a second, then Suppes (which goes deeper than both Goldrei and Stoll, but in my opinion is poorly organized and suffers from nonstandard and funny-looking notations), followed by Halmos, Machover, and a few more. And last and least, the incomprehensible ""book"" by Vaught",1
"  I've not heard the above saying before,but knew immediately exactly what it meant.This book is an excellent review of what it means to be Irish and what Irish,and particularly Catholic Irish is all about.  There are over 50 million scattered around the world who claim Irish ancestory;and by no means are they all alike.  ""Almost anything you can say about Irish Americans is both true and false.""  Dezell's discussion about CWASP's, Catholic/Celtic White Anglo Saxon Protestants,is a bit different ,but right on the mark.  The book is loaded with one-liners or epigrams.Here are a few to get your curiosity:  ""No point being Irish unless you think that the world is going to break your heart someday.""  ""As is often the case, conventional wisdom is wrong.""  ""Irish blood doesn't water down very well,the strain must be strong.""  ""God gives us no more than we can bear.""  Rose Kennedy  ""There is no race of people for which pychoanalysis is of no use whatsoever ."" Sigmund Freud  ""If you're feeling something,for Gods's sake take something.""

"Height adjustment is fantastic.  Eyeglass wearers will know what I mean -- no more tilting my head to see the monitor through the ""sweet spot"" on my glasses.  Tilt feature allows much more adjustment than factory stand.  This stand also lets you rotate the screen to a ""portrait"" mode.  270 degrees of swivel lets you turn the monitor so others can see it clearly without looking over your shoulder.  Assembly was a snap; the hardest part was figuring out how to remove the factory stand from my monitor.Extremely minor nitpick: the cable slot on the base is too small for the ferrites attached to the video cable.

"This is simply one of those ""required reading"" films--part of the new Western Cultural Canon. If you are exploring older movies, or are simply exploring, you'll find considerable merit here: an excellent script, a dazzling Brando performance, a cast that's from top to bottom exceptional, beautiful direction, tremendous atmosphere and cinematography, and a dynamic score by Leonard Bernstein. It's almost an exercise in how to make a fine film.For younger people who may not have a good sense of what the past was like, or may have learned too much about certain struggles and not enough about others, this is an educational film. This is what New York City--and most of urban America--really looked like back in the Fifties. Get a good sense of that and you'll understand why so many back then were drawn to glass and steel skyscrapers and big colorful cars with tail fins--between the Stock Market crash in 1929 and the end of WWII in 1945, urban America was a mean and grubby place, and it took till the late Fifties to begin to change that. The mean and grubby characters are pretty accurate too--nothing glamorous about corruption and racketeering back then. It was a pretty sad world.I'm a little bewildered and saddened by some of the reviews this fine film has picked up",0
"My daughters, 16 months and 2.5 years, just LOVE this tea set.  Since the set is for 4, the girls have plenty of dishes, cups and silverware to share between them (without too many fights).  I love that the toys included in the tea set are very durable, and won't pose a danger, even to my 16-month-old. The price, at $15, is reasonable, and worth the money for lots of hours of play",0
"For Sartre Man is thrown into the world without having being asked whether he wants to be here or not. This means in Sartre's terms that Man is born without an Essence, a fundamental nature. That Nature is shaped instead by decisions, by conscious choice, by our freedom.But human beings, contrary to Sartre are born into family, communal , national , religious traditions. They are born into worlds in which there are values. They do not begin their journeys in life as blank slates.This means that the ' freedom' which Sartre tends to make his absolute (i.e. while denying that we have a nature he makes Freedom our nature) is qualified and limited for all of us in many different ways even before we begin to make conscious choices. Nonetheless the pessimistic doctrines of Marxism and certain forms of Christianity which tend in the direction of a total determination of our collective nature , are rightly criticized and qualified by Sartre.Sartre's celebration of the possibilities of human self- creation and transformation of reality certainly provide a special kind of hope, and youthful sense of our own humanity. ""We are the makers of what we are, of what we are, and what we are not""I would see parallels here between Sartre's existensialim and James-  Dewey American pragmatism.Nonetheless I would want to argue that in negating the importance of our connection with Transcendence i.e. with God, Sartre woefully, and unnecessarily limits human freedom. For for many human beings the greatest free act of their life is their choice to devote their lives to making closer connection with God",1

"I can safely tell you this is THE best album ever! Im a professor at the Institute of Knowing Stuff, and i KNOW ALOT OF STUFF! Brittney is still a struggling girl, with not much money, i mean why else would she be 3/4 naked on the album cover? She deserves our purchases, her lyrics send chills down my vertabrae and false ribs. I was fortunate enough to bump into her at Beverly Hills, i saw her with some idiot punk named Kevin something, and realized how cruel life is to her, obviously shes a ""ho"" of some sort and that was her pimp, not trying to be rude, but thats what life can make ya do! Sure Brittney is an ""attratve"" girl, but is that really why she was put into the music industry?? Our music industry would NEVER EVER choose beauty over talent! Her voice is pure and lulling, her lyrics match those of the other greats, Hilary Duff, Justin Timberlake. She might as well be the best talent put on the face of this earth!-Professor Ra",0
"i'm going to have to go with the other reviews and say that this is an awesome cd, but but should not be your first They cd. The songs take some getting used to, but there are some real treasures - &quot;Hey, Mr. DJ&quot;, &quot;Don't Let's Start&quot;, and the wonderful Untitled Track 13 - for those of you who are not familiar with this, it is an actual recording from when you could leave a message at Dial-A-Song (718-387-6962 just a call to local brooklyn!), and a woman named Gloria didn't realize her conference call was being recorded....anyway, if you like They, then get this cd. If not, get another one or two (i'd recommend Flood for a first one, or maybe Apollo 18), then buy it",0

"One can only wonder if the other reviewers actually watched this film, or if they were simply mesmerized by Riefenstahl's reputation for ""genius"" and the film's ""influence.""  Aside from a few remarkable scenes (the scenes everyone is familiar with, even if they don't know the filmmaker's name), and the lurid subject, the film is virtually unwatchable.  Like many big-budget, modern studio creations, the trailer is the best part, and seeing it in its entirety can only detract from the power of ""those"" scenes.  No film of which the trailer is better than the whole can be a great film, and no filmmaker can be called ""great"" based on a few minutes of stunning footage in an expanse of ennui",0

"I remember watching this movie in the theather when it first came out.  I was in high school at the time, and we had been studying Shakespeare.  This movie founded my love for this amazing playwrite.  The modern spin on the movie really makes the characters more relateable, and makes the Shakesperean language easier to understand.  It is fast-paced and dramatic, and watching it 11 years later, I still teared up.  DiCaprio and Danes were both remarkable, and I applaude the directing",0

"This is a marvelous and instructive memoir on Ms. Keyserling's many years in active politics in South Carolina. She battled long odds in a deeply conservative state and was able to accomplish much in her 16 years in the  State Legislature. She was an early and important ally of former SC  governor and current Secretary of Education Richard Riley, and was one of  the leaders who helped pass the progressive educational reforms that  improved that state's educational standing and performance. She overcome  much to fight the 'good fight' for progressive environmental laws, energy  conservation, regulation of nuclear and solid waste, and promotion of the  arts. The forward is by Richard Riley and she has glowing recommendations  from novelist Pat Conroy, former U.S. Senator Nacy Kassebaum Baker and  columnist David Broder. She is a long time member of the League of Women  Voters, and that group was very instrumental in most of her political  battles. I enjoyed the book and found it useful and enlightening. JM",1
"Now that we have had the benefit of over two centuries of historical-critical biblical studies, we might now very well ask:  Where do we go from here?  I would offer that the fundamental working hypothesis of such studies is that ""they made it all up"" and so the scholarly task becomes one of reconstructing that process, but the unquestionable assumption behind it all is that anything, positively anything, is more credible than traditional Christian faith (this is amounts to, for the critical scholars, a doctrine of ""justification by doubt"").  And so the game proceeds.  Canonical scripture is called upon, and even appealed to, when it can be interpreted to support the working assumption that nothing at all is what it might seem when it comes to Christian origins.  But whenever scripture supports a traditional understanding, then it is systematically demolished, discredited, decoded, and rejected as the purely ideological product it most assuredly is.  And all of the other texts, the schismatic, heterodox materials and the Gnostic drivel--which the Church had its apostolic reasons to reject--must simply be seen for what they are, and not evidence of Christianity's original ""denominational"" condition.Bart Ehrman is a most clever and educated man, but, contrary to what some might assume, he DOES approach the material at hand with a clear bias and set of preconceived understandings.  So let's forget all the by now stale appeals to scholarly objectivity (not to mention, personal integrity) and letting ""the sources speak for themselves"", because that is just so much fantasizing as well.  Traditional Christian faith is dismissed by Ehrman and his ilk as being simply one more product of identifiable historical forces and thus it has no intrinsic claim to truth.  But try reading the Bible with the assumption that it is all true, that what it tells us about who Jesus of Nazareth is, and the beginnings of His Church are a reliable enough account of what did happen.  I realize that such an enterprise is inconceivable to the scholarly guild (with the refreshing exception of people like Luke Timothy Johnson and N.T. Wright), but philology is not faith, and in the end, it should never even be considered as a basis for it.  Ehrman's reconstructions are thus of interest only to a person who would treat any kind of 'faith' resulting from it as a kind of personal plaything, and not as the daily challenge to his own being. Remember, Christian faith is ultimately about God and our relationship with Him, and not about the way in which we might choose to arrange the intellectual games we play with faith and our musings upon it. If you are interested in keeping God at arm's length and not dealing with real issues of personal growth and spiritual integrity (the kind that comes not from footnotes but from abiding in the Holy Spirit), then buy this book, read it, and enjoy whatever feelings of superiority it might give you.  But if not, if you are seeking the one, true living God who awaits those who would believe in Him through His Son Jesus, who is the Christ, then forget about it and all the other 'ragings of the pagans'.  You see, they are the ones you will be able to spot on the closeout shelf.   ",1

"If The Lord of the Rings proved one thing it's that a well made movie version of a great book or series of books will wet people's appetites for the books themselves. And you couldn't do better then this set. Dark, brooding, and mouthwateringly twisted, Frank Miller redefines the film noir genre in bold strokes that was only hinted at with his classic takes on Batman and DareDevil back in the days as he introduces us to Sin City and the Goons, Golddiggers, Bad cops, and boozie Broads who inhabit it's city limits. You'll realize just how fine a job was done with the movie when you get this set and check out the books done in a classic black and white style like the noir of old done as only Frank Miller could do it. A triumph. Another good book I've recently enjoyed is the scifi adventure ""GAAK"" by Darryl Hughes. Four misfit kids set out to save the world from kooky aliens from outer space. It's sorta like The Goonies meets The Invaders from Mars. Spielberg would be proud. LOL!   ",1

"Issued in May-June, 2006, ""Morro Bay (Images of America)"" by Roger Castle and Gary Ream for The Historical Society of Morro Bay, is a very welcome and important addition to the limited printed information available about the history of Morro Bay, CA, a California central coast treasure.  This is a must-have volume for local residents and others interested in Morro Bay history, along with the earlier classic 1982  ""Morro Bay's yesterdays: Vignettes of our city's lives & times"" by Dorothy Gates and Jane Bailey.  Both books provide extensive historical photos not available elsewhere.  While most Morro Bay historical information that is online can be found from links from the historical tab of morro-bay.com at morro-bay.com/historical, the contents of these two books exceeds what is available online.  Castle and Ream pack their 128 page ""Morro Bay (Images of America)"" with fully annotated photos on every page.  The magic of print-on-demand pioneered by their publisher arcadiapublishing.com makes for an interesting intersection of modern technology with historical content.  I wish the authors had used Photoshop photo enhancement more aggressively to bring out the contrast, brightness, and sharpness of the hundreds of photos painstakingly assembled in this wonderful collection.  The amount of time and effort devoted to collecting and preparing these photo treasures must have been be extensive.  Thanks to the authors and The Historical Society of Morro Bay for this essential addition to my library",1

Whether contemplating a foray into yoga, a new career path, greater involvement in one's community, or simply guidance on small ways to make yourself -- and the world -- a better place, Wilson delivers on all counts with a blend of personal wisdom, experiential advice, charming literary references and essential checklists that is guaranteed to get your creative juices flowing in energizing, potentially unexpected ways. Wilson walks the reader step-by-step down a path where, with a little dedication and a lot of flair,  breakthough innovation and personal growth can be just around the corner. Highly recommended",1

The illustrations are wonderful - full of color and imagination - and the writing is fresh, a wonderfully smooth translation. I am a librarian and I noticed another librarian has also recommended this book. That should tell you something! It is a useful book to help kids think about what it might be like to be blind, but I think it transcends that and becomes a book that personalizes itself to whoever reads it. Someone going through a hard time could find comfort in how the girl keeps going despite her fears and uncertainties. Another reader might laugh over the colorful elephants in some of the illustrations and just enjoy the way the book stimulates the imagination. I just love it! I am glad I've added it to my personal collection and I will definitely recommend it to customers at the library",1
"An acquaintance at my (non-Catholic) church told me recently about a wonderful, saintly woman that he had known many years ago, who had devoted her life to helping the poor.  When he said that her name was Dorothy Day, it didn't really ring a bell.  But a few days later this movie was on a cable channel, and I knew that I had to watch this.The movie totally blew me away!  It was great seeing Dorothy slowly learning to accept a form of religion, then trying to apply that to her life.  It seemed as though the more she applied the lessons, the tougher the lessons got.  And the ultimate lesson of the movie was one of compassion: how can you care for people who won't care for themselves?  How can you feed and give shelter to winos, prostitutes, drug addicts, and the insane?  Add to this the difficulties presented by the Depression, and the fact that most people at that time thought that Dorothy was either evil or foolish.I enjoyed the way that they portrayed the lead characters as being well-meaning but sometimes less than perfect, having doubts along the way about whether their actions really had any value (in other words, they were depicted realistically).  Watching the movie, you can't help but learn vicariously through Dorothy's actions, evolving as she's evolving, until she reaches that level where she can finally see the good in everyone.This is something that we all need to learn.  We can't all become a Dorothy Day or a Peter Maurin (her mentor), but at least we can try to move in the right direction",0

"This is one of those films that makes me think it must be impossible for anyone to make a truly great film.  The back cover makes it sound like a must-see for anyone going through a tough time in their lives and wanting a shoulder to lean on, and it seems all the critics concur that that's not an inacurate description, yet when I tried watching this film, I couldn't stand it!  The whole thing was a jumbled mess.  It kept going back and forth between things that I just didn't care about, tedious, boring things, and I think it focused too much on the criminals involved in the story, making them sound sympathetic or whatever, when the film was about a cop who was overcome by grief (supposedly, or something like that) at the death of his partner who was VICIOUSLY KILLED by a criminal.  A story like this shouldn't spend petty time detailing the exploits, trials and tribulations and whatnot of why the vicious killer kills people and does whatever else and all whatever...and when the writer wasn't focusing on the goodfornothing criminals, it focused on a bunch of pathetic backstory, the kind that makes teenagers cringe at the thought of reading a book (too much ""character development"").  And then I saw a truly breathtaking film, titled BATMAN RETURNS (1992) and was blown away by its depiction of heartbreak combined with stunning visuals, and everyone else is like ""oh, who cares?""  I truly hate this film and I hate the society that lets people make such mediocre crap and then acts like its THEIR civil duty to put up with it (as in watch it) and then say they liked it.  And no, not all my favorite films are action/pop-corn flix.  I also liked 1999's BRINGING OUT THE DEAD, as well as 1976's TAXI DRIVER, and I even enjoy the occasional ""little movie"" (there's too many to mention, but I'll start with the last one I saw that I enjoyed: THE WILD DOGS, by the director of THE HANGING GARDEN - another film I hated).  Ok, that's all I have to say about this film",0

"this book is a must for anybody interested in the tales and legends centred upon the Grial. It is also very pleasant to read. The author presented here the (then, that is 1920) revolutionary theory that most elements in the cycle of the Grial stories are actually the remnants of incredibly old fertility rituals that, somehow, survived in  remote parts of the Roman empire. It is extremely interesting to see how the author reached this conclusion and how she was prepared to defend it against the campaigners for the christianity of the Grial. And on top of everything, she writes in a deliciously archaic English, sprinkled with French and Latin (mind the quotations. They are not translated",1

"Yes, this is a compilation album (a collection of tracks from different albums rather than one issued complete by the artist), but who cares.  This is a collection of fine Christmas tunes by great artists from the era of the big bands, jazz, and swing.  Besides, anytime you can hear Louis Armstrong make music is a time to be happy and that seems particularly appropriate to the Christmas season.On this album, the tracks given to Mr. Armstrong are ""Christmas in New Orleans"", ""White Christmas"", ""Christmas Night in Harlem"", ""Cool Yule"" (particularly fun!), ""'Zat You, Santa Claus"" (yes, the tune covered by Buster Poindexter), and ""Winter Wonderland.You also get to hear a young Mel Torme in a live performance of his now standard ""The Christmas Song"" (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire).  Particularly worthwhile.And we get Christmas songs by Dinah Washington, Peggy Lee, Eartha Kitt, and Lena Horne.  The other friends are tracks by Lionel Hampton, Duke Ellington (a rousing big band instrumental of Jingle Bells), and Louis Jordan.This is a great album to have filling your house over the Christmas Season",0

Of course once i had read the book i had to own it and have since purchased many of his other works, which i read and re-read. In short this book is better than the bible, by far my favourite novel of all time and well worth the read, as long as you have an open mind to magik, sex, anarchy, religion and mythology.

"A collaborative effort with virtuoso violinist Dr. Nigel Kennedy, this album finds Mr. Duffy's romantic songcraft polished to an epic sheen. The violin stylings add a Steve Reich-like edge to the songs, broadening the sonic impact of Mr. Duffy's pop observations. Big, melodic, electric, and lyrical, the title track is one of his best tunes ever. This is a fantastic album to get lost in.  The interplay between impeccable pop and the edgy, modern string arrangements give this album an edge and a depth that, while immediately appealing, also reward close attention and repeat listenings. If you like atmospheric, melodic songwriting, you will find much to savor on this disc",0

The articles investigate peace and justice, both of which are sublime and never-ending human obligations, from various Buddhist traditions.

I just recently attended EFI University and was told by instructor to read this book. It had great information for beginning tuners. It even had section about tuning individual carburetors. The electronic fuel injection section was very informative but gave a slight bias to tuning british vehicles and individual throttle bodies. The book had many british words which I had to look up to understand. It included a special version of Emerald M3DK program to help beginning tuners to gain hands on experience,1
I thought that Sweet Sixteen was a great book to read. The Story was really creative and we got to see a different side to Buffy and Dawn in the book. I think that Buffy being a kind of mentor to Arianna was absolutely brillant and the whole story was great. The whole back story of the girl getting superpowers and buffy seeing herself in the gilr and wanting to help her kind of reminds me of why I like the Buffster. Two thumbs Up,1
"At last! A wonderful resource book has been written that I intend to hand out to my customers and friends who are considering relocating their lives here. This guide tackels all the nut and bolts (see chapter 5 - Settling In) that most guides wouldn't bother with as they are geared to having fun in the state not living here. And thank you Victoria for a chapter on the Maine = Siberia weather myth that we locals are CONSTANTLY engaged in with those &quot;from away&quot;! I think I'll just hand them the book next time the &quot;how are the winters?&quot; question is asked. This is a well organized book that deals with the likes of taxes,getting your car registered, buying a house,education,cultural events,geographical descriptions and much,much more. It will be my companion playing Maine trivial pursuit while waiting for the kids to finish their ballet lessons. PS; it is a fun read",1
"This is a huge hit with my son, now almost 2 years old.  He wants us to read it to him repeatedly, and for a boy who loves books, this is his all-time favorite.  I think that a combination of the language, the pictures, and the ""moral of the story"" is what makes it so appealing.  The book is a lot of fun to read, with interesting rhymes and a fun story about a dog who wants to get into the zoo.  The dog changes his spots many different colors in hopes of getting accepted into the zoo, but ultimately finds that where he belongs is the circus, which is more suited to someone with his abilities.  It's a nice message about finding the right place for yourself, and accepting who you are.  The children who watch the dogs' tricks are dressed in cute retro '60s styles, and they are drawn in that fun ""Jetsons"" sort of style.  I can't recommend this book enough",1
"Whether or not interested in Extreme Programming, a software developer should certainly read this book. As a warning, the book is not a detailed techinal guide of how to apply XP. It's more of a emotional guide of how to better ourselves as being a programmer.

If you have huge amount of technical knowledge and experience and still feeling something is wrong, this is the book which will enlighten your path",1
"This is a must-read for anyone who has shared a kitchen or a table with an apron-clad companion.

Impossible not to enjoy this",1
"I've been looking for a good Korean cookbook for ages and have already purchased 8 of them through various sources (Amazon being one of the main ones) and been disappointed almost every time.  Not so with this one.  I assumed from the somewhat cheesy cover that this book would be fairly Americanized and a gamble at best, but it's proven to be one of the most comprehensive Korean cookbooks out there.  There are several sections which deal with things like table settings, manners, customs, and recipes for the most basic of sauces and dips that you will use over and over again.  The back has a nice little index of useful information and illustrations that demonstrate various techniques in the cooking process.  Also, the recipes are quite authentic and don't leave out important steps.  The author tells you how to press the Dubu before cutting and frying it...which I know seems fairly simplistic...but you don't know how many countless cookbooks have left out that most important step when making fried tofu.  I've tried several of the sauces and have been very satisfied with the flavors.  The only downside is that I wish the author would have included useful substitutions when it came to the cuts of meat.  Some of the pork and beef sections used were unclear on which cuts were used and were simply referred to as ""pork"" or ""beef"" even when you knew a specific cut was probably used.Overall it's one of the best tools in my kimchee making kitchen.  Another I recommend is Duk Suni's cookbook.  Please avoid the Kimchee Cookbook and Flavors of Korea though, as the recipes in them are vague, missing steps, and or just not authentic",1
"This dvd is excellent! It's a great follow-up to The Art of Knitting, which I also have and enjoy tremendously!!! Nancy Brown's stitch-alongs were great and the crochet portion is a wonderful start for anyone who is new to the world of crocheting.

"This is a superb book that will be of enormous use to those who must counsel families of troubled teens.  These teens are a group of individuals who need acceptance,love, inspiration, and guidance.  This book gives the counselor practical tools that are time tested to help families gently and wisely direct their teens onto a path of hope and success.  The reading is fast and easy, filled with practical case studies that hold the reader's attention. It will also be useful for families of troubled youth to read, particularly if they are not already in counseling. I recommend this book without reservation",1

"Although I'm an avid reader, I'm fairly new to the historical fiction genre. Having recently read two good historical fiction books, and seeing all the rave reviews for this book, I decided to check it out from the library; I am definitely glad I did! This is not only the best historical fiction novel I've read, but it's also one the best books I've ever read!Penman completely flips the ""standard"" character of Richard III that many of us are familiar with; instead of presenting him as an evil, manipulative hunchback, we are introduced to a character that's honorable, kind and romantic. Penman adroitly manuevers Richard and a large cast of characters through one of the most confusing periods in history (in my opinion)--the War of the Roses. Richard III is probably most notoriously known for being the (probable) murderer of his two young nephews. However, Penman presents us with an alternative solution that is quite compelling. Will we ever know really whether Richard III murdered his nephews? Probably not. But does Penman (who has made the reader fall in love with Richard throughout the novel) make you fervently wish that Ricard is innocent? You bet.If you're a fan of historical fiction (and even if you're not), please give this book a shot. You won't regret it",1
This is one of those rare books that is a compelling read AND educational AND inspiring.  This book is several stories.  It tells the story of: a family challenging the brutal murder of its son by the powers of oppression in Paraguay; the changing commitment to human rights by the US government from none to some and back; a personal story of a US human rights researcher who becomes totally involved in the life and struggle of the Filartiga family; and the creative and innovative legal work of the Center for Constitutional Rights in NYC.  No one is the book is perfect but they all keep trying in the face of incredible obstacles.  After you read it you will be telling your family and friends to do the same,1

" Sixteen-year-old Declan Steeple hasn't seen his free-spirited mother Lindy in six years. His father Bernard has moved on with his life, creating a new family with his girlfriend Birdie and Dec's little sister Sunny. Bernard is content with his life in the present while pursuing his hobby building miniature models of famous battles in history. Dec would rather just face the future when he could leave his family's home and perhaps pursue a career in architecture. Then one day, Dec and Sunny come across the body of a mysterious intruder in Steeple Hall, his father's family home where Dec had spent his early childhood years before Lindy left. Dec briefly met the intruder when he hitched a ride from him a few weeks before and thinks that because he accidentally mentioned a secret road leading to the old house, this prompted the man to take a chance at burglary. When Sunny mentions that a bust of Plato was placed on a side table instead of by the fallen bookshelf where it once sat, Dec begins to think that something far more sinister has taken place. The mysterious death causes Dec to begin having visions of his mother as he remembered her when he was a young child: Lindy being dressed as Wonder Woman, Lindy and Dec playing hide-and-seek with a frustrated Bernard, and Lindy telling a young Dec to rescue her from the manor. The visions are hazy and surreal, making Dec wonder if they are really memories or just dreams. He decides to ask Bernard and Birdie questions about Lindy, but they're unwilling to reveal many details especially as to why Lindy left. Frustrated, Dec seeks refuge in Steeple Hall and confides in his best friend Ezra, a quirky science geek who helps him make sense of the bizarre visions. As time goes by, Dec slowly pieces together the confusing puzzle of visions. What the puzzle reveals to Dec changes everything he thought he knew once again. There are revelations about his family, Lindy's disappearance, and the mysterious dead intruder. THE THIEF IN THE HOUSE OF MEMORY is a mystery that portrays the complexities of friendships and family, while set against the backdrop of a house harboring mysteries of its own. It's a book that is sure to be pleasantly thought-provoking for readers.[...",1

There are lights that flash in time with songs.  Overall, we're exceedingly happy with this toy and believe that it'll be a part of his life for a long while to come",0

"In UNE FEMME DOUCE, Bresson tells the story of a beautiful young woman's  suicide without emotion or tragedy and with great awareness of the coldness  and detachment that hallmark the final stages of some suicidal depressions.  Many critics have approached this film warily, calling it a &quot;minor  work&quot; or citing elements of its story as &quot;inexplicable.&quot; But  perhaps that is its strength; Bresson has made a wholly successful film  about inexplicability, about the warped and supersensitive reactions and  motivations of a mind drifting downward and downward. The hardest thing to  understand about a self-destructive act is &quot;why?&quot; -- the  &quot;why?&quot; is the most feared component of suicide. UNE FEMME DOUCE  is the most direct addressing of &quot;why?&quot; ever put on film. Bresson  delivers a fascinating answer, one that takes a couple of viewings to  distill. The more you think about UNE FEMME DOUCE, the more it becomes a  vital work in Bresson's thematic panoply, and certainly the foundation work  for his late nihlistic flowering. This is a film to watch and ponder again  and again",0

"Having built over 20 rooms in our audio post production business over the last 25 years. I have bought every studio construction book from Jeff Cooper, Alton Everest, Philip Newell, Peter Grueneisen and others. This is a great addition to my library. Rod Gervais compliments the other books by bringing the topic up to date for the year 2006. While some of the construction tips are a bit expensive for a small (no) budget bedroom studio, he does show you how to build an nice mid level studio. Gervais, covers a lot of area from room isolation, air conditioning systems, even shows detailed step by step procedures for building a hypothetical basement studio. He also lists several suppliers like Auralex and Real Traps who offer many newer cost effective solutions for home studios, many of these suppliers were not around when some of the ealier acoustics books were written. He also links to his website and provides XLS files for calculating diffusor well sequences and other acoutic calculations.Again no one book covers all things, still that is why I feel it important that you should read everyting you can on the subject.  I also wish he'd go more in depth in how he built the new Power Station room (he could write another book on it). Still in IMHO a nice addition to any amateur studio builder's library",1
"I recently bought this radio, primarily for my car, but also got the home dock. It was easy to set up and install both types of kit. Unfortunately, the sound quality was very poor in both configurations. The FM modulator for the car was pretty close to hopeless. It only has maybe 10 channels. I found one that was free, luckily. But even with a clear channel, the sound had a terrible hiss, that went up and down in volume at apparent random even when everything was stationary. The occupied channels actually worked about as well (still lots of hiss)- except when the underlying channel broke through. Even disregarding the hiss, the sound quality on the music was not very good.    I thought the problem was probably with the FM modulator, so I tried it in the home dock, connected to a *very good* home hi-fi system. The hiss was gone, but the sound quality was completely unacceptable. For whatever reason, this particular receiver doesn't like the compression artifacts very much. Satellite radio quality is, AT BEST, about like an average MP3, with highly compressed signals (some channels better than others). This receiver seemed to exacerbate the effect, and it sounded a lot like a tin can and string ""telephone"" most of the time. It was vert irritating very quickly.    The form factor (about the size of a modern walkie-talkie) was fine, and pretty easy to fit in the car. It also seemed to be pretty solidly built. But all of that is completely moot if it doesn't work properly.       I returned the receiver and both kits the next day.",0
"I recently got back from my North Carolina shopping experience and I wanted to share how invaluable the advice in Ellen Shapiro's book was.  I have bought furniture directly from NC stores before, but always after shopping in Chicago and contacting them with my selections.  I had been looking in the Chicago area for over a year for a new dining room set, and hadn't found anything that I liked.  I bought the book, and planned my trip to NC.  Was it worth it.  I found many stores with sets that I liked, including an entire store filled with English reproduction furniture.  I was able to see, touch, and sit on many items that fit my taste and budget, instead of being told that my taste is not what's really ""in"" right now, and there's nothing for me to see.  I found the advice in the book regarding how to prepare for the trip especially helpful.  I was able to buy my entire dining room set, and furniture for my family room in 3 days of shopping.  It was an efficient use of my time and I saved thousands of dollars.  I will never be able to shop in regular furniture stores again. ",1

The sound effects do crack us up - no car ever pulls up to or away from the curb without screeching the tires.  The stories are really the best part.

"...and this is the true strength of the book. Jane Freeman's work reflects her classically trained background and does not sit well with the often twee world of miniature 'craft'. If anyone can bring miniatures out of its association with children's toys, Freeman can! This book showcases the work of Freeman and other artists who work in miniature form in brilliant photographic colour and quality on every page- not a single, irritating and pointless black and white among them. I turn to this book when I feel the need to be 'freed' from the conventions of miniatures, namely expense, scale, and realism in the traditional sense of the term. Freeman's talent for producing the essence of what is most important in life is second to none in the miniatures world, and her flair for finding alternative uses for rubbish is ingenious. My work took quite a different turn after the influence of Freeman, from heirloom creations of the Australian past, to scenes of my own life which actively engages the onlooker by requiring their interpretation. This was my most expensive miniatures book purchase, and one of the most valuable. Highly recommended",1

"In re-reading Malcolm X Speaks, I'm struck by how well he understood the viciousness of the U.S. system of oppression and how clearly he expressed the need for all-out, uncompromising struggle against it. The capitalist class lashed out at Malcolm X for these speeches, not just because he criticized their system, but because he dared to awaken the oppressed to their unconquerable human potential.

"This is a well written book that should benefit everyone. The book explains the importance of effective communication skills for success in business (a large corporation, a small company, or even a home-based business) or in the home, with friends, in relationships and anywhere else. The author methodically explains the communication process including the message, the channel through which the message is conveyed, the receiver, feedback, the context of the communication and the barriers to effective communication and ways to overcome them.For example, the author highlights the fact that in verbal communication, an active dialogue is engaged with the use of words. At the same time, however, non-verbal communication takes place, relying on nonverbal cues, such as gestures, eye contact, facial expressions, even clothing and personal space and how they influence interpretation of messages, including how the message is delivered.. The need to be mindful of cultural differences in communicating was explained, for example when using or interpreting nonverbal cues. The need to pay close attention to your tone of voice, even your voice's overall loudness and its pitch was highlighted.The book also covers public speaking and how you can make better presentations, for example, by keeping the message clear and simple, being prepared, being vibrant and natural when delivering the message.Other very important and interesting subjects covered including the importance of being assertive, having good listening skills, and being an effective negotiator, among other topics. The author reinforces his message with exercises that you can use as a self-help tool to improve your communication skills.All-in-all, an excellent book that is highly recommended",1
"This is a great book. It's another one of those ""what would I have done if I was there?"" Frankly, I don't know. It's easy to ponder what I would have done or what the right thing to do under those circumstances was from a warm office, 52 years after the fact. The author packed in a lot of historical information about the Korean War, the POW experience, and the courts-martial, but also kept the characters alive and the book read like a great but tragic novel. Some of the characters in the book, such as PFC Rothwell Floyd or SGT Gallagher were despicable and richly deserved their convictions and sentences. The rest, like COL Liles, LTC Fleming, and Major Alley seemed to be only doing what they needed to in order to survive and save their men. At some point though, it seems like some of the POWs began crossing the line and doing more than what they needed to survive. This book confirmed the absolute evil of communism and its double-speak with words such as ""justice"", ""peace"", etc. that were used to mask its real agenda. It was also ironic how many of the Chinese and North Korean interrogators were highly educated people who had studied English at American universities. This book really shows the depravity that men can sink to under some circumstances",1

"I've seen graphical guides for CSS and I've seen very complete descriptions of CSS elements, but this book is a great combination of the two.  For every styling element mentioned in this book, there is at least one diagram to help understand how it works.  This way you can see exactly where the borders of an element are.  This book isn't about making things pretty with CSS, in fact all the examples produce very ugly and plain results.  The point instead is to show every single CSS element and what happens when you change the attributes of it.I found this extremely useful for floating elements.  There are 9 given situations where blocks are floating in the page.  For each example, a supporting diagram shows where the element is put in the code of the page and where it actually will display based on the floating attributes and what other blocks are already on the page.One thing the book could have used would be browser compatibility references.  I know that support for page-break-before/after/inside is sketchy, but perhaps it's just beyond the scope of this book.  It's a book about CSS styles and how they interact with each other, but not necessarily when it's safe to use them.",1
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I have been through various Western treatments and wanted an alternative.  I wanted to learn about Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for treating infertility and this book is full of useful information.  If you don't want to do acupuncture, she describes the use of acupressure or light stimulation and provides a detailed description of the various acupoints.  She even provides diagrams.  The book is an easy read.  There is also plenty of information on Chinese herbs and how to improve your diet.  This book promotes health and well-being as a way to treat your infertility.  You can also use TCM to complement your medical treatment.  Read this book for another point of view",1
"I bought the Mega Bloks Dragon Mountain set for myself a few months ago and had yet to put it together.  The only things that I did put together were the dragons.  The instructions for putting it together are well done.  They tell you exactly what you need for each step.  An improvement would be some views from above to make the building process a little easier.  The completed structure is actually two separate structures joined by the bridge for the mine car.  As impressive as this set is, it holds together quite well.  The key is to build, as with any other Mega Bloks set, on a good hard and level surface.  I've moved it a couple times and one of the smaller base sections will fall off, but that's no big deal since there's nothing underneath to hold it in place.  It'll take two trips to move it so don't move it all at once.  Just make sure you carry the larger structure by holding onto the floor of the second level and take your time while moving it.  One other nice improvement would be the addition of a second cannon.  I love the idea of mounting the cannon onto the dragon, but it would be nice to have either second cannon mounted on the smaller structure as it shows in the instructions or even better yet, a harpoon lancher.  Other than that, I feel that the Dragon Mountain is a great addition to the Mega Bloks Dragons series",0
"I am not related to the author and I love this book. I am an expat living in Tokyo and have bought several copies as gifts for my children's friends back home in the States.

"Every Lakers fan I've ever met lives in the past sadly now.  To them, the clock stopped when Kareem and Magic hung up the shoes [and we know why Magic had to leave].  Their basketball knowledge from the 60s to the 90s is rewarding.  After this, however, they don't have a clue of what has happened to this once mighty and moral organization.The Lakers have been a good team over the decades [as apparent on this DVD set], but the run of greatness is coming to a LONG slide with Kobe driving the Bus.  The Lakers were once considered the Green Bay Packers of the NFL, but now they're just lucky to even get close to a playoff spot over a majority of the teams in the Western Conference which are much better than the present Lakers.I recently attended a game last Fall at the Staples Center, and besides all of the celebs eating hummus in the stands, I could barely hear myself think over Phil Jackson's mantra ""I told you so.""Further illustrating how things have changed in LA, Jack Nicholson has become embarrassed to wear anything purple or yellow.So it is understandable that Laker fans would rather focus on the achievements of Magic and Kareem, than rather extol the diminishing skills of Kobe since his Colorado folly.  There are some good games on this DVD along with great moments from the Baylor, Chamberlain, West days.  I recommend any Laker fan to purchase this DVD set to relive the past.So Laker fans, keep living in the past if you so desire.  Maybe Kobe will retire and become a man of the cloth and lead the Lakers to the NBA Championship promised land once again.Long live the Forum [or the Staple Remover Center] or whatever they are calling the Lakers home now",0

You can spend 15 or 20 years going to workshops, psychoanalysis, aromatherapy, psycho-kinesiology, acupuncture, energy-work, etc. etc. OR you can read this slim volume and spend a life of profound joy understanding you own divinity",1
"This book has all the basic information one requires to understand the role of proper dieting and exercise for healthy living, and how our lifestyle impacts various health risks.  It is superbly written, easy to understand and follow.  It lacks glamour and fanciness, does not promise miracles, and maybe it is for that reason the book is not well known to the masses.  It only speaks the scientific reality, which is the only one.   For two years, I applied Dr.Elliott's simple scientific formula, which accounts for one's built, calories consumed, and impact of  exercise on metabolism, and monitored my weight and shape.  Theory matches with the outcome with reasonable accuracy, both in periods of dieting/exercise and sedentary lifestyle.  I wish Dr.Elliott publishes new edition.  One problem with this book is that it is pretty old.  People like me would like to hear from him,on what had changed in the past 15 years.  Nonetheless, great work, great book, buy it..",1
This is an essential reference for Victorian Crazy Quilters as well as silk ribbon embroidery enthusiasts.  The instructions are clearly written with excellent illustrations of the results with different widths of silk ribbon.  There are wonderful projects that can be done by anyone from the beginner to the experienced embroiderer.  I recommend this book to all new members of my Quilting Bee,1
"This is the 4th edition of the book and is well developed.  If you have Martin's Physical Pharmacy, you'll find this book a suitable reference as well.  This book focuses more on the industrial setting while Martin's focuses on the physical (as noted by the title).  If you are working at any point in the formulation of a drug, this book is a must have",1
"I am a Jane Austen fan, to say the least. I have read all her works and enjoyed them. The only thing that annoyed me was the fact that I knew little about culture and life in her day. When I saw this book I was very excited. It gives a brief history of England (during the time of Jane Austen's life), a biography of Ms. Austen, explination of the culture, and detailed explinations of each book. This book is packed with pictures and maps that are also very helpful and give each of Jane Austen's stories a &quot;face.&quot; If you are a Austen fan, you need to read this book",1
"I had already given birth to my first child at home and was pregnant with my second when I came across this book at the bookstore.  I'm a lover of birth and decided to pick it up, despite knowing nothing of it.  I'm also a notoriously slow reader but tore through this book in just a few days - it was so compelling, funny, heartbreaking, and honest.  When I did end up giving birth to that second baby, the birth happened so quickly that my midwife didn't make it and only myself and my husband were in attendance for what was a peaceful home waterbirth.  While I labored, fully understanding that I was going to do this without assistance, I literally thought back on the stories in the book and drew strength from them.  My experience was quick and intense and I finally understood the ""roar"" of a woman in labor, the way Ms. Vincent described.  Thank you for writing such an empowering book.  It helped give me the ability to recognize the strength I already held within myself.  I'm now pregnant with my 3rd child and look forward to reading this book again",1

"Most of us remember December 7th, 1941 as Pearl Harbor Day. To Terence Kirk, it is more memorable as the day that he (and 202 other China Marines) were captured by the Japanese. They were to remain prisoners for 1,355 days, the entire length of time the U.S. was at war with Japan. American Marines in Japanese prisoner of war camps were 17.5 times more likely to die from the treatment in those camps than they were to die in combat. Mr. Kirk survived. and as of the time of writing this book there were 31 survivors of the 202 China Marines. Unique to Mr. Kirk, so far as is known he was the only one to have built a camera while in the POW camp and taken pictures. This is his story and some of the pictures. Mr. Kirk ends this book: 'If not for the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , we would have met certain death.' I think he's right",1
"We all know how great the songs are on this CD -- 5-Star all the way.However, I guess there's an unlucky few oddballs among us who can't play the SACD hybrid CD format of this particular reissue on our PC.  Which also means that we can't add the CD to our iTunes or iPod music selections.  In this day and age, that's severely limiting, so I regret this purchase (I don't have some jalopy of a PC/processor either, as my computer is less than seven months old, with 2GB of RAM).I don't know who to blame for my ""mistake"" -- myself?  Amazon?  Sony?  Philips?  ABKCO?I'll blame myself and be more careful next time -- in part by avoiding ""DSD-"" or ""SACD-"" labeled items.I'll also give the CD 1 Star on the basis of its limited technological usefulness to me",0
"I got this book when I started having problems with my 4-yr old. He's pretty compliant most of the time, but recently started testing my limits. I was perfectly aware that the problem was with my techniques, not with my child. I just knew that I wasn't getting my message across to him, but didn't know what to do.  Reading this book I learned that I was on the right track, but having problems with determining good consequences and following through with them consistently.  This book gives very detailed examples of mis-behavior and many ideas for consequences.  It also has several ""what if"" scenarios for those times that the discipline process does not work as expected (which happens to me a lot). This is the book that I will recommend to every parent who gives an inkling of interest in improving their parenting skills",1
"This was their first turn of career (1973), as it was their 1st TRUE PROG EFFORT,containing some classics;you can appreciate the amazing title track &quot;Ashes are burning&quot; very much, or the first interesting track &quot;Can you understand&quot; too, whose melodies would have been utilised in the mythical album &quot;Turn of the cards&quot; once again !!(for example in the amazing mini-suite &quot;Mother Russia&quot;). The beautiful mix of russian and indian music as well, by means also of some pretty songs like &quot;Carpet of the sun&quot; and &quot;At the harbour&quot;,contributes to make this album highly recommended..",0
If you have truely studied Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcom X then you have probably seen pictures of this book next to them on their desks. Don't think for one minute that you understand prejudice without reading  this book first. It explains why prejudice occurs and how it is part of our  basic makeup. Mr. Allport also explains how to change these perceptions  that generate the discrimination. For any Civil Rights Advocate this is a  must read. It puts you inside the mind of those who practice bigotry and  discrimination. If you cannot understand them then how can you defeat them,1
My son is 18 months old and loves the piano. He will sit in front of it for hours (something another toy has yet to do). Even his older brothers (8 yr old twins and 14 yr old) play with it to show him how what to do. The demo mode is the best...He will press it and just dance and laugh. So far it is holding up to the banging and constant playing. We love it!,0
"I'm no genius in RF Engineering but I have come across a lot of good Microwave Engineering books and this is NOT one of them. More to the point, I work entirely with other RF engineers and every person I showed this book to shuddered and began spouting off profanities at it. Although the book does start out simply enough, the chapters tend to give only a brief overview of the material. The real trouble starts when you try to work the problems at the end of each chapter. With no solid examples or clear explanations of how to proceed, I found myself referring to my other RF textbooks for support.I have no doubt that if you are borderline Genius, this book will make perfect sense to you. ...But for us less than genius personality types, keep looking, your book is still out there",1
"How many varieties of pleasure can a book offer a reader? Read this book and count your own delight in its wit, wisdom, emotional truth, sweetness, deviltry, beautiful writing and as many other rare qualities as you can find. Grenier, an editor at the venerable French publishing firm Editions Gallimard, writes hilariously and affectionately about his own dogs, foremost among them the noble Ulysses and the happily trampy Sarigue. He also ranges through world literature to recount with great Gallic charm the experiences and musings of many others who have similarly fallen under the canine spell. In one section, he notes, &quot;Schopenhauer, the pessimist, wrote about the goodness of dogs: 'I would have no pleasure living in a world where dogs did not exist.' Depressed, and prey to phobias, he alternated portraits of dogs with portraits of great philosophers on the walls of his little apartment in Frankfurt.&quot;  Page after page bristle with startling facts and opinions that combine this same complex mix of the erudite, idiosyncratic, insightful, affecting and zany. He also remarks in passing that, &quot;Any bookstore will tell you that books about cats sell much better than books about dogs. Who's to say why?&quot; This unique and entrancing book could well end up disproving Grenier's own statement",1
"As a strategy consultant, & whenever I go to the movies (or watch movies at home), I often take the opportunity to seek out possibilities of using them to teach life (survival) skills to participants in my seminars & workshops.The two Bourne movies, namely The Bourne Identity & The Bourne Supremacy, are two great examples.Both movies are loosely based on Robert Ludlum's work, which included The Rheinmann Exchange, The Osterman Weekend & the Holcroft Covenant. They have also been made into great movies.In the first move, with the opening scene: An unconscious young man is pulled out off the Mediterranean coast by a fishing boat one stormy night. Thinking that the young man is dead, a curious fisherman with a scalpel finds two bullets in his back & a microchip in his hip. The chip reveals a Swiss bank account. But our wet hero isn't dead but realises that he has amnesia. He then rushes to Zurich. In the bank vault, he discovers his name, Jason Bourne (played by Mark Damon). In addition, he finds a baffling pile of different passports, all with his picture, and a large chunk of cash. In the US Embassy, he bumps into Marie (played by Franka Potente), along with the fact that someone wants to kill him. Armed with a bag of money and superb martial arts skills, & with Marie by his side, he scours Paris for clues about his identity and past life...& finds himself in the middle of two assassination plots (one assassin was played by Clive Owen, as 'The Profesosr') masterminded by rouge elements of the CIA.In the second movie, with the opening scene, continuing from the first movie: Jason Bourne is recovering in Goa, India with Marie. He spots a mysterious dark-glassed man with the wrong clothes while jogging. He escapes with Marie but she is shot in the ensuing chase. The next scene shows CIA operatives under deputy director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) conducting a sting operation to fish out a mole in CIA but something goes wrong. Her subsequent investigation leads to the highly-classified Treadstone project, which apparently involves Jason Bourne. She even finds evidence that Bourne is behind what happened to her botched operation. So Bourne sets out to clear his name. The remaining part of the movie shows Bourne outsmarting CIA operatives - & the assassin (played menacingly by Karl Urban as Kirill) - & tracking down the rogue elements in the CIA with shady connections to the Russian mob, who have jointly framed him in the first place.In the two movies, Jason Bourne demonstrates his uncanny ability to observe & pay attention to what's around him - note: notice the exceptions in the details of the environment - which allows him to constantly stay ahead of his predators & at the same time, stay agile (mentally & physically) to anticipate dangers & get out of precarious situations. For example...remember the scene in the second movie...after he had jogged at the beach, he observed a dark-glassed man whose clothing & behaviour somehow did not match the environment...His ability to stay calm, size up dangerous situations & come up with super-quick, innovative solutions to escape from capture is well demonstrated in both movies. For example...remember the scene in the first movie, where he jumped down several storeys with a dead body as cushion while blasting his gun at his assassins running up the staircase...the scene in the second movie, where he improvised a weapon out of rolled newspapers & an explosive escape using a magazine stuffed into a burning toaster in a quickly engineered gas-filled room...Wow! that was great!Naturally, I am also fascinated by the many unique fighting sequences (particularly the one within a tight environment in the second movie), car chases, cat & mouse games, etc. in both movies.Additionally, what I like about both movies is the total absence of super-duper gadgets commonly found in such spy-thriller movies. Jason Bourne used only his sheer human ingenuity & creativity to outsmart his enemies.To end my review, I must add that I have enjoyed watching both movies, experientially as well as educationally",0
"When I listen to this live recording I feel as though I am really there.  The introduction given before Frank takes the stage gets you really excited and pumped. Then when Frank hits the stage he starts off with ""The Lady is a Tramp"" as the crowd gives him a warm welcome.  Right away, we see that Frank's voice is still in great shape.  He sounds great!Most of the concert features classic ballads like ""I've Got You Under My Skin"", ""My Way"", ""I Get a Kick Out of You"" and ""My Kind of Town"".  I was very pleasantly surprised to see ""The House I live In"" included on this CD.  This is a great siong about America and its people. Another pleasant surprise was ""Leroy Brown"".  That is a great song and Frank does such a good job singing it...as he does with any peice!Every so often Frank talks to the crowd.  He shares stories about his own life as well as some humor...nice touch.One of my biggest regrets is not being old enough to have ever seen Frank Sinatra live.  I'm 27 years old so it just wasn't meant to be.  I can only imagine how truly great it was to be there at Madison Square Garden on that magical night in 1974!    ",0
"This is probably the single-most important set of CDs if you want to enjoy the music of a truly stand-out group.  Besides the high quality of talent, the production values on Spinners' tunes was always the best.  It's easy to wish that the same members of the group who gave us ""Rubberband Man"", their version of ""Working My Way Back to You"" and so on and so on were out there right now on tour and would someday once again come to town.  It would be a concert not to be missed.  This is all we have though and I say you'll have no regrets by purchasing this memorable and listenable music",0
"i own many of these sets and like most of them. this set is very good. i don't know if i got lucky or what, but all the transfers look very good,not great,but very good. there are some fun movies on this collection,and as the title says they are family friendly",0
"Maybe I am a softee, but some books are too good to come to an end. My way of reading them is to read other books in the meantime; books on my bed, books in the bathroom, by the coffee pot. This way I won't have to say goodbye to a friend in the end. I know it's going to happen, but I don't want it to.It's harder for this book because I grew up with the Beatles and all involved. As I started this book, I could see the man, hear his voice, it was as if I were right there with him. Here was this atomic force in his control and he helped mould it into something we can appreciate for a lifetime.This book has taught me a great deal about recording at the time of the Beatles. But it encompasses much more. If you don't believe me, read about the monkey! I almost peed my pants! This book is filled with little gems like that, and you'll have to read them for yourself.",1
"Sovereign seems to skip around often in a half-hearted effort at being comprehensive.  The cases are not very recent, despite the publication date, and the book has a definite lack of flow.

This book offers practical exercises that almost anyone can do to strengthen the body and prevent and eliminate back pain.  I highly recommend it,1

"My husband fell in love with these shoes but couldn't find this exact color in his size in other stores. When I finally found them on Amazon for such a great price, we snatched them up immediately. These shoes are very nice and also very comfortable. They look good with almost anything; you can dress them up or down and look fashionable. My husband is very picky with his shoes, and comfort is a must for him. If you have a hard time finding shoes that fit your style and comfort, these may be the ones for you",0
"This book is packed full of technical and historical information, all presented in an engaging way. I was surprised at how captivated I was throughout the entire book and by how much I learned!

I'm a young guy, and this is a great scent that I can wear to work, to class, or out to dinner and know I smell great for the occasion.  Its the kind of fragrence that subtly exudes masculinity rather than clubs people over the head with it. I love it and I can tell you the women in your life will love it too. ",0
"Yes. Wild things is what I recommend for our jaded eyes. Aren't we sick of all the crowd pleasing PG-13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed - most of all with hardly a plot? Wild Things is sex sex sex but with witty capital H humor and a twisted story.Recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film. Candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast (from Oscar nominee Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon etc) can turn candy into cuisine",0
"Well, as of writing this review, I have yet to see the movie but I have heard the soundtrack. I got it based on the fact that I loved David Julyan's previous scores for Memento and Insomnia (have yet to hear The Descent) so I blind purchased it. All I can say is, if you enjoyed the scores to those films then this builds upon those. It works very well on its own and doesn't sound like every other film score out there. I cannot wait to see and hear this movie! Sorry for such a lackluster review, but I don't have much to go on more than having heard the music. Enjoy folks!",0

"  Reading through the reviews that are available as I'm composing this post, I note that all of the foreign readers give it 5 stars, and all the bad reviews come from America.  Also, I note a whiney tone in most of the bad reviews.  I found the book to be excellent",1

Stressed the importance of medication and ignored the plight of those (like me) who have tried pretty much every med on the market and experienced no relief from symptoms.3. I was personally offended by the brief discussion of antidepressant side effects which, when mentioning sexual dysfunction, focused solely on MALE sexual dysfunction and completely ignored the fact that most females on antidepressants cease to experience orgasms. Apparently I'm a filthy whore who shouldn't be concerned with my sexual enjoyment",1

"     I highly recommend this book be on the US Army's Chief of Staff reading list for officers (if it has not already been done).  This is one of those rare books whose message is not only important, but presented in a format that is easily understood.  Creveld's message does help put wars like Iraq into proper context.    I would compare this book (of the same topic) with others like James Dunnigan (of How to Make War fame) or books by Peter Drucker (who write books about management, but can also be applied to war).  Again, I highly recommend this book not only for its important message, but also for its clarity",1
"This biography of Wall Street baron Jay Gould is in some ways a primer on how American media and public opinion seem to demonize capitalists who succeed at doing what capitalists are wont to do, namely, making money. Of course, Gould was no ordinary capitalist. His ruthless tactics gave his enemies a big target to dislike. After all, when you single-handedly create an investment bubble that leads to a crash in the price of gold, resulting in congressional hearings aimed at placing blame, you expect to make a few enemies. Veteran biographer Edward J. Renehan paints a fair, nuanced and colorful portrait of Gould, whose manic focus on business success probably was driven by his tragic childhood. We strongly recommend this book, especially to students of business history, in the belief that it offers a more in-depth record about an extraordinary and extraordinarily flawed man who was vilified in his time",1
"I purchased this book before a recent visit to Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and Taos. I lived in Albuquerque for 4 years about 6 years ago, but I hoped to find new insigts on places to eat, explore, etc. Basically the guidebook told me where not to go. It failed to mention some excellent restaurants in Albuquerque including The Dog House, Las Mananitas, Il Vicino, etc. In Santa Fe I attended a class at the Santa Fe School of Cooking which was a five star class - not mentioned in the guidebook. In Taos I visited a community of alternative homes constructed of tires and cement (earthships.com will explain more) - again not mentioned in the book. I did go to look at a ruin near Espanola that was recommended, but the reservation does not allow admittance",1

"The drip coffee is excellent.  I love the programmable timer and ease of making coffee and cleaning.  The machine is quiet and makes coffee very quickly.The espresso maker is great.  The machine makes excellent espresso with espresso beans, I repeat here, espresso beans. It is also quiet, which I really like! There were a couple of tricks I had to learn - one is to make sure that the ""taste"" dial is not positioned all the way to ""strong"" otherwise the espresso machine skips making espresso and instead sends the steam to the foamer.  I like the foamer but it is a bit particular. First, it must be cleaned right away and the foamer does make a bit of a mess all over on the inside of the unit - milk seems to bubble out and go under the removable milk compartment and get into hard to reach places to clean. Second, the foamer works well with skim milk or 2% but not so well with whole milk - this is stated in the instructions as well.  I love whole milk in my cappucino so that was a bit of a drawback for me.  Overall, I have really enjoyed having this machine and look forward to making either coffee or espresso.  It is a bit particular in that everything needs to be exactly right for it to work otherwise issues will arise. I've got it dialed now. I would advise reading instructions all the way through once and look over diagrams, then go back and read instructions and set up new machine step by step. It makes everything easier to understand",0

"I really enjoyed reading Wrinkle Free Forever. It has a lot of great information on not only how to treat wrinkles but how to overall just BE healthy. Dr. Murad talks about inclusive health, The Water Principle, and protecting your skin from environmental invaders. It's a simple read and not full of long medical terminology. I totally related to everything Dr. Murad spoke about and his recommendations all made sense",1
"Tim Powers is one of the best writers in speculative fiction ever, but I think he bores easily. Each book is in a totally different world view. Except that everything that could be is. I always wish he would write more stories in each world but no. No trilogies here. This is the consummate pirate book. A tale of the end days of piracy in the Carribean with vodun and magic thrown into the mix. With the absolutely great concept that magic is a resource that can be exhausted in time. Like all of his stories there is a feeling of being in a dream out of control. I kept feeling that there was always something more; something I could almost see. . .but never quite. Everything is major, world changing events portend and the characters are fully realized and strong in will and intensity. Intensity is the pace to the end. What a great story, but then pretty much everything Mr Powers writes is that. Get it, read it, enjoy",1
This is so darn cute.  I actually got it for me for Christmas.  My kids have to ask me if they want to read it.  I keep it in my room. ,1
"This book isn't a how-to; some of these designs probably wouldn't be too practical for the average dog person to build. What it is is a fascinating and fun look at the inspired creations of some of the world's architects with the purpose of providing shelters for dogs, and even a few historical facts, figures, and photos. A terrific coffee table book, Barkitecture is valuable as something to peruse with a friend at leisure and determine which styles you like and dislike. There is a wealth of doghouses found in these pages, proving the author's committment to scouring the globe for all the most brilliant and/or puzzling ones. The photographs are excellent; some of these canine casas have exquisite detail. A couple of them look genuinely uncomfortable, I must admit, and others just make you wonder why anyone would ever even dream up such an odd mansion (or monstrosity). Others are just fun to look at. The Muttropolitan Museum features six paintings of famous dog composers and opera stars, all with clever names; my favorite is the one on the upper right-hand side, though it's difficult to make out some of the names they were given. Some are funky and colorful. Some are luxorious. Some defy description, and some are just remarkable; the bone-covered !!!*SIT*!!! has photos of dogs on the walls and is painted like a real house. Foreign Correspondent is notably decorated in curtains and pillows. Some houses are culturally inspired, and Red Rover even has a pool attached. How can one beat that? Truly this is a book worth flipping through at least once. You might even get a few ideas for your own dog",1

"""Extinction Journals,"" by Jeremy Robert Johnson is so cool that upon finishing it, I walked out of my apartment and kicked a tree until it collapsed.  Then I screamed.  Some neighbors came out and complained, but I simply shrugged and lent them this incredible little book.  Their screams now fill the night and not a single tree within five miles is left standing.Let me start off by saying that Mr. Johnson's short story ""The Sharp-Dressed Man at the End of the Line"" is quite possibly my favorite short story, ever.  In it, a man named Dean makes a suit out of cockroaches and summarily survives a nuclear holocaust and kills the Twinkie-suit wearing president.  If this is too awesome for you, I'm sure Nicholas Sparks has some new heartwarming tale, just a click away.The book picks up where the story left off, and right from the beginning I was hooked. The weirdness escalates, but Johnson's genius lies in his ability to inject just enough off-hand, real-world knowledge to allow you to suspend your disbelief when you're introduced to fishy chariot-gods and a naked love interest covered in ants.Johnon's writing is frenzied, hilarious, and at times very beautiful.  His incredibly sharp style is unrivaled by any young up-and-coming author, and is truly stunning.The book has its shortcomings, the main issue being that the breakneck pace leads to an underdeveloped villian and a not quite fully realized relationship between Dean and the ant girl.  Johnson doesn't seem to want to let up, and while this works for most of the book, it left me wanting to know more about these two characters.Which leads me to think that maybe (despite Johson's thought in the back of the book) there should be a sequel.  I loved these characters, and I would love to see the weirdness continue.""Extinction Journals"" is pure imagination.  I have to say I enjoyed it immensely from start to finish.  This is a funny, scary, disgusting, and body rockin' little novel.  Five stars, easily",1
"I wish the rating system had a negative stars rating.  I haven't read this book, but the discription I got from other readers is enough for me.  The saddest part is that, we can tell from the 2nd review that, this book has caused at least 1 japanese person to take on the belief that americans could never know or love real sushi.  this is a tragedy",1
"Wonderful book.  Highly recommended.  The book is a history of a very overlooked portion of the role that the so called &quot;occult&quot; has played in the formation of modern science and medicine.  It traces with  wonderful skill, the foundations of the Royal Society.  It shows Bacon was  FIRMLY entrenched in the lore of alchemy and hermeticism.  Those early  scientists were indeed the last of the great alchemists.  She goes on to  show the link between the &quot;invisible college&quot; and the rise of  objective thought that culminated with the Renaissance.  In the process she  charts the greater part of Pre-Renaissance history!  If you have an  interest in the esoteric foundations of science, then this is a worthy  expenditure of your time",1
"`David Burke's New American Classics' by, of course, David Burke with co-author, culinary pen for hire, Judith Choate is a great foodie cookbook and if you appreciate good food and cookbooks, stop reading this now and scroll up and order yourself a copy instead of wasting any more time reading my thoughts on this truly worthy cookbook!I can generally recognize very good and very bad cookbooks after about two or three minutes of reading the table of contents and the introduction. I could tell this book was worthy of consideration even before I opened it, based on an appearance by Burke to promote the book on the Today show a few days ago. Being an inveterate watcher of both talk show food segments and Food Network shows, I have become jaded to most conventional rehashes of typical dishes where the segments are little more than shuffling swapouts. Due to the fact that lamb is one of my very favorite things to eat, Burke got my attention in that his segment was a new take on doing filleted leg of lamb. Having just done a leg of lamb for Easter with less than spectacular success, I was quite willing to listen to new ideas, and Burke hit the nail on the head. His solution is to easily fillet the rolled leg of lamb meat into its easily identified component muscles, saute the seasoned pieces almost as if you were doing a beef fillet, then pan-roasting the seared pieces to the correct temperature, requiring not much more than 10 minutes. I was hooked. Then I opened the book, and found the whole book to be chocked full of such ideas.Burke's first attraction was the fact that his Table of Contents listed every major recipe rather than simply the usual tired chapter headings. This Table fully revealed his strategy of offering three variations on 39 classic American recipes.The first recipe of the trio is a traditional dish, although not necessarily simple or easy dishes and not necessarily the most familiar traditional fare. It is more likely that the traditional recipe will be a tradition of great American restaurants than great American home cooking, although there are exceptions.The second recipe of each trio is a contemporary take on approximately the same ingredients. The contemporary dish is always different enough from the classic that it is worth having and making both recipes without risking a boring `oh, that again' from your family or even yourself. Most contemporary dishes are also `restaurant grade' and not necessarily original to Chef Burke, but most are well within the capabilities of an experienced home cook.The third recipe concept alone is worth the price of the book, in that it gives a recipe for remaking the leftovers from one of the two earlier recipes into an entirely new dish. The recipes for the leftover French toast and pancakes alone may be worth the price of the book, as I constantly find myself making a standard recipe for either and am left with about twice as much as I can serve at the time.Speaking of pancakes and French toast, any good cookbook which covers breakfast almost automatically wins my heart, as breakfast is easily the most widely neglected meal in cookbooks, especially for those of us among the retired 60 Somethings who need to stay away from high salt and empty calorie dishes so common in breakfast fare. Our advantage is that we have the time to take an hour in the morning or some time the night before to do up oatmeal right.All of this would be for naught if the recipes were not good, and I am certain that these recipes are more than good. My first clue was when I spotted Chef Burke's cooking times for potatoes. One of my biggest complaints about so many recipes is that their cooking times for potatoes, especially for fried potatoes or potatoes au gratin are too short. I see no such problems here. And, while the cooking instructions may be just a bit advanced for the total novice, there is no absence of careful detail to cover unfamiliar procedures. I am so impressed by the care with which the recipes are written that I will even sign on for some of the especially fussy techniques such as storing poached eggs in a warm water bath of a very specific temperature.One of my surest signs of an important cookbook is that regardless of what page I open, I find interesting recipes, comments, tips, and impressions on ingredients. The section of tuna recipes is a case in point where the classic recipe is a tuna steak cooked all the way through, as it was always done before `nouvelle cuisine' got their mitts on the fish. The issue Burke points out is that while this is a very nice way to cook tuna, one must guard against drying out the flesh, almost as one must cook pork chops carefully to avoid creating shoe leather with dried meat. Thus, Burke supplies the appropriate sauce to keep your rather expensive fishy fare succulent.Speaking of sauces, one of the very few ways in which I could think to improve this book would be to give a special index of supplementary recipes of sauces, condiments, and side dishes provided in each of the 39 main recipes.This is a rare book composed primarily of recipes where I feel constrained by only being able to assign five stars, as it is better than many books to which I have already given five stars. This is a truly great foodie book in that there is a real risk that if a non-foodie reads it, they will turn into a foodie, the material is that alluring. This book is most like the two great collaborations between Mark Bittman and Jean-George Vongerichten and the collaboration between Patricia Wells and Joel Robuchon, except that it is better than both for the average cook!",1
"Generally speaking, some tips here work, some not so much, whilst others are good for a laugh.The only situation where I found this book can be useful is when you have debt up to your a#s and need to pay it off fast.  Then this book will be a good book for you to read.  Reason: any money you can put toward debt reduction represents 100% risk free and tax free return on your investment (much like a strip bond).  This could include mortgage debt as well.In the real world this book is less than practical.  For example, the book recommends invest your spare cash at a mutual fund.  This is where you could get killed if you just blindly throw money at your fund without knowing what you are doing.  How would you feel if you cut off the cap of your tooth paste to save a couple of penies, then at the end of a month finds out that you just lost 5% of your net worth in your mutual fund ??  If you are like most people I know, you might say something like this: well, I haven't lost any money because I have not sold, then a month later, you find out you lost another 3% ??  Say if I tell you we are going into a bear market, do you have the courage to short the market ?? how much are you willing to risk in your investment ??  What about giving to your local charities ?? THESE ARE THE REALITIES, folks, not how many pennies you can saved.  Get used to it.  The fact is, a skillful investor and / or trader can make the money 10 times more, much more so than the technics presented in this book",1

"  I do not want to talk about how true this movie is to the Dickens novel,  but simply ask you to see this movie and observe how it makes you feel.  I am a romantic,  but to catch that special feeling that has you reaching for the stars requires superior pacing and acting in a movie.  Ethan Hawke is magnificent in this movie to make that happen.  It is his character that is the vehicle which drives this movie to some very special moments that are both intense and romantic,  without at all being sappy.  The performance of the other actors is first rate,  and I would ask you to simply give this movie a chance on its own terms.  This movie draws you in,  just as Ethan Hawke's character draws in the world  (he is an artist)  and makes this movie a real piece of art not to be missed.  It is also a great bargain for as little as a  penny for the vhs version.  So buy a wonderful piece of romance that is almost free for the taking.  You can't go wrong! ",0

"Regardless of your current thoughts on the subject, this book will help you tie together any loose ends.  It represents a very clear and easily-readable presentation of two opposite views of eschatology: futurism (dispensationalism) and preterism.Like most evangelical Christians today, I grew up learning and teaching dispensationalism.  Many studies in Daniel meant I had the images and calculations down pat.  However, there was a nagging doubt involved in stretching the 70th week out for over two thousand years.  Suddenly -- and recently -- everything is falling into place.If you are unfamiliar with any other view of the end times, do yourself a favour and get a copy of this book.  Both sides are very clearly presented.  Read them and make up your own mind",1

"Noah Lukeman's ""A Dash of Style"" examines how the use of punctuation profoundly affects the meaning and impact of a writer's work. Lukeman's audience includes novelists, poets, screenwriters, and even writers of nonfiction.  The author believes that in order to succeed at his craft, a writer must become a master of--and not a slave to--the punctuation marks at his disposal.  Punctuation can be ""a medium for artistic expression,"" not merely a mundane tool in the writer's arsenal.  As Francine Prose did in her ""Reading Like a Writer,"" Lukeman turns to such literary masters as Shakespeare, E. M. Forster, Ernest Hemingway, and James Joyce, as well as to other lesser known writers, to illustrate his pointsThis slim volume is divided into three parts:  ""The Triumvirate,"" which includes advice about the use of the period, the comma, and the semicolon; ""Into the Limelight,"" in which Lukeman gives center stage to the colon, dash, parentheses, paragraph breaks, and section breaks; and ""Proceed with Caution,"" which warns the reader to use the question mark, exclamation point, italics, ellipses, and the hyphen sparingly and with care.  Lukeman discusses the overuse, misuse, and proper use of each punctuation mark.  There are rules that limit how and when each type of punctuation should be used, but in some cases, the rules can and should be broken.  The writer must listen to the rhythm of words with his inner ear.  By using punctuation marks judiciously, writers control such elements as the pace of the text and the impact of dialogue.  To help the writer put his advice into practice, Lukeman includes interactive exercises throughout the book.""A Dash of Style"" is breezy, fast-paced, and entertaining, and it has useful tips that can help make any writer a more thoughtful craftsman.  After reading this book, writers will be more likely to monitor the length of their sentences, employ a consistent style that fits the content of the work, use such punctuation marks as the colon and semicolon more creatively, and take extra care that the punctuation marks they use fit together effectively to convey the work's meaning.  As Lukeman says, ""We begin to see that punctuation marks by themselves are like colors in a palette:  it is only through the collective that they become all they were meant to be.""ADDED NOTE:  I recently e-mailed Mr. Lukeman about the use of the word ""belie"" in his book.  For those purists out there, here is my quibble:You [Mr. Lukeman] write on page 15, ""Punctuation, more than anything, belies--clarity--or chaos--of thought."" Later, on page 136, you write, ""The overuse of the dash belies scattered thought.""   The dictionary definition of ""belie"" is:1 a : to give a false impression of b : to present an appearance not in agreement with2 a : to show (something) to be false or wrong b : to run counter to : CONTRADICT Didn't you mean the opposite of what you wrote?  Doesn't the writer's use of punctuation marks INDICATE, not belie, his clarity or chaos of thought?  Doesn't the overuse of dashes INDICATE, not belie, that the writer's thought processes are scattered and disorganized?  Therefore, the word ""belie"" would not make sense in these two cases.  If I am wrong, please set me straight.",1

"Kate Scott is living a quiet life as a professor of Medieval Literature at a small university. No one there knows her secret, including her colleague Samuel-the man that she believes she is in love with. That is why it is so shocking to her when she's invited to one of his lectures and finds that she is the topic. Many years ago, Kate Scott was Myla Wolfe-the young subject of controversial photographs taken by family friend, Ruth Handel. Myla had changed her name and disowned her past after the tragic murder of her sister, Prudence. Driven back home by Samuel's lecture, leaving behind everything she knows as ""Kate Scott,"" Myla is determined to answer the mysteries of her past; including the benefactor who reveals himself one tiny bit at a time, providing snippets of answers inside of more questions. Myla discovers that everyone has secrets; including Samuel and those she calls her ""family"" since her father's death. She also discovers the secrets that she has been hiding from herself. This debut novel, by young author Miranda Beverly-Whittemore, takes the reader on a thought-provoking journey through the childhoods of Myla and Prudence. It teaches that sometimes all isn't as it appears and that unprejudiced thought and analysis are some of the most important things one can have. The prose is eloquent, the voices are priceless; the message is so very touching. ",1

"Ive only had the printer a short while but have printed enough to see that this a great printer, extremely easy to set up, a great deal for all that you get and excellent print quality.  The new pigment inks this printer uses are said to be fade resistant for nearly 200 years, for a while pigment inks didnt look as good as dye based inks, especially on glossy paper, but hps new vivera inks are gorgeous!  The printer is quiet, and unobtrusive when printing (though its always kinda big on the desktop but thats part of the deal with a larger format printer).  The quality of the chassis is excellent and all parts work together very nicely, you can tell that alot of thought and time went into this design.  Most importantly, though ive used it on and off for about a month, i haven't seen any problems with clogged nozzles or banding or any of that, hp recommends the printer be left on all the time and it will intermittently run some diagnostics and very short cleaning cycles which are said to use almost no ink (unlike epson which has big problems with clogging, and volume of ink used during cleaning in my experience).  What a great printer!  Buy it for sure!  As of February 2007, its only competition is from epson (as the canon pigment 13 inch wide printer hasn't come out yet) and it beats the epson for three important reasons.  The hp can print on matte and glossy paper with no toggling of the black ink cartridge (a stupid idea that a big company like epson should no better than to implement), the heads in the hp are replaceable (for about $40-), whereas the epsons aren't.  If they were to develop a very bad clog or be damaged or wear out, they are easily replaced and the printer would then self-calibrate itself to compensate for any differences between the two heads (awesome! and something the epson cannot do.), and the cleaning issue already discussed.  Ive had two epson printers, both of which hated me the whole time, always being whiny about how their heads were dirty and wasting paper and ink by clogging in the middle of the print (something the hps built in calibrator will recognize and correct for, thanks hp guys!)  Its only drawback is that its a little bit ugly...but...well...its ugly, make up your own mind (sorta ugly like an old volvo though, in my experience things like that tend to grown on you!)  So in summary, hp clearly spent alot of time to win market share from epson (who basically invented bubble-jet printing tenish years ago) and has done a GREAT job of it.  This printer really raises the bar for all other inexpensive high grade amateur printers.  If you can afford it, you will be very pleased with your purchase",0

"I was very impressed with this story. I saw it in the theater, and also have this version on DVD.  This is one of the most intense, longest, fulfilling movies available on the topic of the pornography industry in the 70's and 80's.  Very stylistic and (un)believable.  A (c)ockumentary of superior proportions.  But it wasn't really a documentary, just a Hollywood movie, based on a time, when porn was coveted by the raincoat crowd.  When I say (un)believable, I mean the story truely is unbelievable, in that the porn industry is not a man actor's world, but clearly belongs to the female actor.  She is the star in this industry.  So, when I see a movie like this, I worry for the young men out there, who think that they are the next ""Dirk Diggler.""  While, I'm probably over worrying the concept, I still hope that my words reach some man out there.  This is not reality.  This is a fantasy, conceptualized by a Hollywood Director; and nothing more.In reality, this could have easily been a story written about a female actress, such as Rollergirl?  Interesting enough, the director fell into the cliche, making Rollergirl, a victim.  Chastised by her Highschool classmates, and ran out of school.  But in reality, we in the know, know that it is the Jenna Jameson's and Tera Patrick's who are the real starts.  I give this one 5 stars though, as it really is an over the top effort by the director.  I was quite impressed.Two hard ones up!  This movie rocks!MC White said: Check it out!!",0

"Blount reads Revelation through the context of African-American culture, particularly African-American church culture. Blount states that in Revelation, John is asking, ""Can I get a witness?"" and when the preacher in an African-American worship asks this, ""The preacher wants you not only to hear what he is saying but to understand and then to act upon it"" (37).In terms of literary context, Blount writes that at John's time, witness meant witness, not martyr. He sees parallel irony in the fact that just as Roman slaughter brought more witnesses, not less, the same is true for racial hatred directed at African Americans. Slaves were not permitted to have their own services; to do so was to express resistance. Blount likens the shouting out of slaves in worship to the shouting out of the slaughtered souls in Revelation (54). Similarly, Blount sees the dressing up of African Americans at worship as related to the wearing of white robes by the slaughtered souls in Revelation.In Chapter 4, Blount interprets the hymns in the Book of Revelation through African-American music. Blount sees the hymns in Revelation as helping ""John's hearers and readers to initiate such resistance on their own"" just as ""music has been a primary weapon black people have waged in their fighting back"" (93). Blount sees the hymns in the African-American church and the musical genres of African-American spirituals, blues, and rap as being created out of oppression and an active resistance against it. He sees the hymns in Revelation as arising out of the same combination of oppression and active resistance.I highly recommend this book.",1

"Tonight I watched Romeo and Juliet again, this time with two of my granddaughters.  I have seen it with my parents, with my wife and three children, and now with my grandchildren. I attended the movie in Washington, in Boston, and in Albany, NY many years ago.  This version has become part of my life, as have its stars, Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn.  Why I have not reviewed it before, I do not know.This Royal Ballet version of Romeo and Juliet is so fine, so spectacular, so moving, and so incrediblly beautiful that in my opinion there is no other ballet that can compare with it.  First there is the poignantly tragic love story of Shakespeare. Add to it the hauntingly expressive, classic-yet-modern music of Prokofiev.  Stir in Kenneth MacMillan's sensitive and exuberant choreography.  And as the supreme touch, have it danced by the most exhilarating male dancer who every performed, in partnership with the most delicate and vulnerable ballernina of the past century.  Here you have the masterpiece of all masterpieces.  A ballet that puts other ballets to shame with their weak plots and lack of emotional substance.  My two favorite scenes are the balcony scene, and the scene where Romeo dances with a lifeless Juliet.  The first exudes love and passion, as Nureyev and Fonteyn are transported by their new-found love to a height beyond all measure.  In the second, your heart freezes and you strain to hold back tears as Romeo tries to coax the life back into Juliet by dancing with her limp but still graceful form. There are no touchingly valid moments such as these in any other ballet I have seen.The superb costumes are worthy of a Zefferelli production, although this is not one, of course.  The scenery is adequate but not impressive.  But most important, all the dancers communicate a vitality that is convincing and contagious.  The swordplay is amazing in its complexity and realism. Tybolt's death and his wife's grief are overdone with just the right touch of modernity.  But mainly, Nureyev and Fonteyn bring each scene they dance into brilliant flower.  And when they dance together something of the mystery and tragedy of their two very different lives comes to the surface and animates their performance, giving it a realism that communicates their deep emotion for each other.This is heartfelt and heart-wrenching art. When it finishes, one is exhausted and drained, but also inspired and delighted that this one-of-a-kind performance was recorded so that one may enjoy it over and over again. ",0

"Karr &amp; Chu write to inspire improvement in biological assesment protocols; no doubut I agree with them on this goal.

"I loved this book! It is a must read. I blame this book for instigating thoughts and ideas in my head that have led me in a totally new direction for my future ministry. I highly recommend it for every Christian - especially those in church leadership. Wolfgang Simson dreams of a church ""which does not need huge amounts of money, or rhetoric, control and manipulation, which can do without powerful and charismatic heroes, which is non-religious at heart, which can thrill people to the core, make them lose their tongues out of sheer joy and astonishment, and simply teach us The Way to live.

Something which spreads like an unstoppable virus, infects whatever it touches, and ultimately covers the earth with the glory and knowledge of God"" (p. xii-xiii). He believes that there is an ""imminent reformation of global proportions"" and proposes that this will only be achieved by having a church ""within walking distance of every person on the globe."" He is calling for the ""very presence of the living Christ in every neighbourhood and village of every corner of the nation."" He feels the need is ""to initiate and promote church-planting movements that initiate and promote other church-planting movements, until there is no space left for anyone to misunderstand, ignore or even escape the presence of Jesus in the form that He has chosen to take on earth - the local church"" (p xxvii-xxviii). Central to his premise is the multiplying of disciples and house churches all over the place. This is a proposal for ""House-church Christiainity"" - but has great implications for any church that is seeking to make disciples of Jesus.Houses that Change the World makes a unique contribution to the need for raising leaders in local churches. Simson challenges the fathers of young families to take spiritual leadership in the home and to be responsible for the spiritual training of their children. He also embraces the fivefold ministry of leadership in Ephesians 4:11-13. ""The biblical calling of the apostle, prophet, pastor, teacher or evangelist is not to assume or usurp `the ministry' and perform it oneself as others look on, but to train God's people for the ministry, to equip others"" (p. 111). He identifies a problem in church multiplication is in the process of leadership development. Because training leaders is ""addition-based,"" it results in the halting of multiplication. Simson rejects the Jethro principle (often taught in church leadership seminars) as ""a policing structure enforcing law and order, not designed to build and empower the New Testament fellowship of grace and love"" (p. 137). He sees that it is dangerous to build a church ""too much on one person's charisma"" and recommends a flat leadership structure, rather than a pyramid.In my church context, I realize that I have adopted a church model that is very programmatic. My heart's desire is to see the vision that is cast in this book fulfilled around the world. I love the imagery of a weekly gathering of believers within walking distance of every person in Castaic and beyond. I want to see Lake Hills focus less on getting people into our church on the weekends, and more on getting our church (the Body of believers) into more homes. Our goal needs to be making more disciples, not making more members.READ THIS BOOK!",1
"Classic Boortz book!  While he may offend some, he brings the issues to common sense, practical solutions.  I recommend it as a refreshing view to all of the ""politically correct"" rhetoric we hear daily",1
"Maurice Castle is working for the Secret Service. In this bizarre profession, he has to deal with leaks, security checks, tensions and suspicions. As Maurice approaches retirement, he realises that some of the decisions he made in the past are now having very serious consequences. In this beautiful novel, the reader discovers what the life of a secret agent is like: he is lonely, isolated and becomes almost neurotic. Greene lays bare a machine, the Secret Service, which overlooks Maurice's subtle and secret motivations that impel him. The characters are beautiful, full of tenderness, excitement and doubt. Mr Tim Pigott-Smith's performance as a reader of Graham Greene's &quot;The Human Factor&quot; in this audiobook is truly stunning. His voice is very pleasant and his vivid reading adds a further dimension to this already excellent novel",1

"I purchased this previously read book as a gift.  It is CLEAN in language and story line.  It is educational (flora and fauna, etc.) and about people with good moral values.  When I finished reading the book I wanted more, so I've read more of Gene Stratton Porter's books and shared them with my friends",1

"This well-crafted historical novel held me captive until I finished it. Descriptions of Oahu, native Hawaiians, haoles (foreigners), and the events of Hawaii in the 1850s seemed entirely authentic. I enjoyed the technique of two complementary stories, each told by the two primary characters (one Hawaiian, one Haole). I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about Hawaii's people and history",1
"On Salon: ""The ridicule doesn't bother you?Shirley replied:Not at all, I'm amused by people who think I'm a nutcase. I even help them write the jokes! I just insist that they're funny. If they're not funny, I think a humiliation."" Shirley started her book GOING WITHIN with the quote ""the person who knows how to laugh at himself will never cease to be amused."" p.181 ""There are no coincidence in life. All is harmonious and has meaning and follows the laws of cause and effect."" Archangel Ariel comes with the scent of sweet vanilla to Shirley on p.166, part of my number and more directly on p.136, weaving the ending of my review for FwG, Shirley wrote: ""Why am I concerned (about mosquitoes)? It was because I didn't want to die from being bitten. I knew that was ridiculous. But I didn't like the idea of them sucking my blood. I laughed to myself. Maybe that came from a vampire past-life experience."" p.113 ""Some of the most cruel and torture-loving have returned as dogs; however, that fate is extremely rare. They return to haunt the same sites to test the honesty of humans."" On 2004-1-9 Kite's first case of trance with her soul or her god, which to Kite is nature, I had access to everyone Asharic record. I found that Mao Zedong is a dog & Hitler is in love with a beautiful girl at that time. From unconditional love I understood that Mao chose the hard fast path to experience & learn unconditional love first hand as Shirley's latest book ""Out On a leash"". Mao and me shared the same `water snake' Chinese zodiac sign. p.109 Shirley wrote ""when Palme [Swedish prime minister a.k.a. Charlemagne, first emperor of France] died, I was devastated. John the Scot continued, `The greatest form of love is to allow the consequences that accrue from another's own free will.'"" Same as saying let them be free to choose and experience the consequences, which is part of unconditional love or let it be. Since I grew up in Paris & did remember my first introduction to incarnation was from an elementary teacher there. Until April 1996 when I realized from John Hogue's Pyramid prophecy and accepted my incarnation as Osiris in a flash [Lisa, who this time around faked pregnancy by me. is an incarnation of Iris and why I spent $100,000 buying her a penthouse]. Thereafter understood I can be all incarnations, like all dreams. I know that Roland is one of my incarnation from the French poetry Song of Roland. When 10-year-old, I imprinted a picture of Roland blowing his horn in the rear of Charlemagne's army & it was posted on top of the wall outside by my teacher.  Shirley only mentioned that I killed the giant Moore thus creating her possibility of having an affair with Charlemagne. It seems that Shirley never met Roland, so we both can create the possibility to meet in this lifetime and to love each other unconditionally. On 2001-3-6 [my number again] I found out mom broke her hip in Weihai. I chose Kite to be mom's second round-the-clock caretaker at the hospital and she was willing to come from Beijing. There Kite asked me 2 questions: Will I continue to love unconditionally and do I unconditionally love myself? The former I answered yes, the latter yes and no. Toward the end of April Kite had 3 dreams. First she was choosing between me and her then boyfriend. Second she chose me and third that I kissed her. I spontaneously declared that I will make her 3 dreams happen in reverse. They did. Later I kissed her on the forehead, while in the back of the minivan cab to the airport, picking up my sister. Then we spent 3 wonderful nights exploring our bodies without orgasm and talked until daylight. We fornicated on our 4th night. So Kite chose me and confided that she was willing to engage me only since I became destitute from Lisa by closing shop and unconditionally.  In May we both went back to Beijing for 3 days to move our things to Weihai. On the last day, she was walking around with her boyfriend like a zombie and he even got Kite in bed to produce baby [Kite aborted one fetus with him the year before]. On the last minute, Kite saw through his controlling lies & jumped on my cab to the Beijing train station back to Weihai. Whew! that was indeed a close call in her choosing again. The first time I went back to her parents' mud-made home in the middle of China for the whole October, I got Kite pregnant by impregnating her twice. My first child Bobby 14 years was conceived the same way. In January 2002, while Happy was taking care of mom, Kite and me with a fracture front heel-bone for a whole month, I chose to fell in love with Happy, who is younger than Kite by 4 years. Happy joined our shop at 16 in 1999, dumped into my care by Kite. Happy is the only junior high-school graduate who became a computer hacker and I increased her stipend from 500rmb to 2500rmb for one month. Then decreased it again, because she didn't have the persistence to continue hacking. Happy told me last year that she experienced every kind of feelings from my roller-coaster ride in 2000. I have been courting Happy since January 2002 and Kite spent one year before realizing that she can accept Happy unconditionally too. In 2004 Happy had 2 abortions with a boyfriend. Happy was willing to confide in me only and I realized that she was choosing to very gently let her boyfriend go, by giving him the gift of more love-making. I made the decision to bring our 2 year-old Imagine back for her and her mom to take care in Beijing in October. I saw the year before, Happy was in unconditional love only with Imagine. She chose to tell me the whole truth about all her male relationships. I told her about all mine the year before. This year Happy is 22 and in May I kissed her on the cheek for the first time and she burst out crying. 2 weeks later, I suddenly felt and chose to stand completely naked in front of Happy. Happy chose to hide herself under the blanket. I was surprised that she didn't tell me to get out. So I played this for more than half-hour, until the spell was broken by a phone call. Next day I chose to lift 86lbs Happy onto my lap. While I padded her back up and down, Happy laid softly like a bird in my arms with her head on my shoulder & her long hair before my nose. This arrangement was broken by the arrival of a friend. Next day 2005-5-22, Happy walked in & I hugged her standing up. She put her head on my shoulder like yesterday. I told her I had no pants like the day before. In less than a minute, she kissed me long on the mouth and to my eternal surprise extended her hand to caress my manhood. I laid her down on the bed and undressed her. Happy told days later that I was the most tender man she knew and that she felt like going to bed with me when she was 17 when I was too lonely. After I left with Imagine in June, Happy chose to have a one-night stand with a very tall American aged 40, and the fellow wanted to pay her cash. Naturally Happy didn't accept and she learned a lot from that encounter. Since then she can average one new boyfriend per week and she chose one young male to go to bed with. Until I returned to marry her? Naturally with unconditional love, there is no need for marriage. Kite and Happy both know that I invited them to live by my side as with my right and left arms. Part of my Camino so far",1

"Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, of blessed memory, has accomplished much in the field  of Judaic studies during his lifetime. By far the most amazing are his  Kabbalistic works, like this, the Bahir. The Bahir is one of the oldest  texts of the Kabbalah. Tradition assigns it to Rabbi Nehuniah Ben Ha-Kana  of the first century CE. This fantastic book not only presents an accurate  translation of the text, but also an interpretation which relates it to  modern Judaism and as a supplement, the original Hebrew text. The Bahir is  a revolutionary book; the Zohar and subsequent Kabbalah is literally based  on its foundation. It is the oldest known book that actually presents the  array of the Sefirot (Divine Emanations) and it deals largely with  interpretations of the Bible",1

"It's a truism that great novels make lousy movies. For evidence of that fact, you need look no further.As the great Hollywood novel (at least there's no convincing competitor), it was inevitable that ""Day of the Locust"" would hit the screen eventually. And when the time came, some effort was made to ensure the job was done right, beginning with the selection of the director, John Schlesinger, a literate British expatriate with a superb track record. But the 70s was the epoch of good intentions gone awry, in film as in everything else.""Locust"" was made during the period when many people considered William Atherton to be an actor. You can see him in a number of major films, his expression never changing, with all the emotional impact of a log. It's one of those things that lends conviction to the claim that the industry runs on herd instinct.But it's not all Atherton's fault, because nobody comes to life in this flick. Not even Karen Black, one of the most idiosyncratic actresses ever, for all that she's playing a hooker (Karen must have gotten very tired of that kind of role). Not even old pro Burgess Meredith, as her deadbeat old man. Donald Sutherland reveals a flicker or two, for all that he's supposed to be playing a lump. The sole exception is Jackie Earle Haley, who portrays the evil-minded child actor Adore with truly demonic intensity. Maybe they should have let him direct.It would seem difficult to make scenes like the collapse of a huge Napoleonic war set or an illegal cockfight look dull, but Sclesinger brings it off. I don't know how -- this is, after all, the guy who made the selection of a new wardrobe for Cold War traitor Guy Burgess look enlightening and entertaining in ""An Englishman Abroad"". Maybe the milieu overwhelmed him. It's happened to other people.It all comes to a head at the climax, which is supposed to illuminate an apocalyptic painting of the destruction of LA by Atherton's Todd. In a single truly effective scene, the distraught Homer Simpson murders the noxious child actor Adore. And then...Well, if you want to see the dullest riot scene in film history, here you are. It's as if Schlesinger said, ""Okay, this the 30s, and there were Nazis around during the 30s -- so let's make the rioters Nazis!"" Thus we get a lengthy sequence in which people wearing very silly masks (they look like a chorus of Leatherfaces from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") stand in one spot goose-stepping. Every now and then the camera shifts to a masked woman staring through a car windshield. And that's your riot. To top things off, Schlesinger then gives us a ""symbolic"" coda that succeeds only in casting into doubt everything we've seen for the past two hours. Nathanael West had an unbelievably tough career as an author. His publisher went bankrupt a week before ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" was due to be published. He died in a car crash only a short time after ""Locust"" appeared. Then they went and made this movie. Remember that next time you start thinking that life is unfair.",0
"In his book The Power of Intention, Dr. Wayne Dyer's main point seems to be that your life is co-created by you and ""Intention"" (which is his word for God or the Source of all power). Life is a constant, eternal process that is always purposeful. In fact, Dr. Dyers says there are no accidents and each of us was intended to be here--precisely on purpose as that is the only way Intention ever does anything.But we are not at all devoid of power or at the whim of some evil force. Things don't just ""happen"" to us. Dr. Dyer says we choose how we experience our lives by aligning our creative powers with the Seven Faces of Intention (creativity, kindness, love, beauty, expansion, abundance, receptivity)or by aligning with the opposite which is our tiny, fear-based ego. He says that ""at every single moment of your life, you have the choice to either be a host to God or a hostage to your ego."" Dr. Dyer believes we can live a more peaceful, joyful life by choosing to go with the flow of Intention rather than making the choice against it. But either way, it is our choice and we will not be denied the outcome of that decision.The book is set up in three parts which are basically: background for what you need to know about Intention and how it works, a step-by-step, doable plan for putting Intention to work for you, and an insightful glimpse at what your life will be like if you work with Intention vs. ego. The preface encourages you to read the last chapter of the book first so you know what you're working towards.For me, this book's most valuable teachings were the author's constant pairing between what choices look like from experiences based on a ""for God"" decision, or the ""ego"" decision. He uses common, ordinary examples of decisions and circumstances that we all face, and then plays them out by sharing real life experiences and encounters.Bottom line, if you don't like the way your life is right now, you must notice and take responsibility for your part in the creation of it. You must quit complaining about what doesn't work for you or what you don't like about your life, and instead, choose your thoughts based on what you want in your life. The creative energy that forms life works absolutely perfectly for everyone all of the time and it can only bring you what you think about and ask for. You have the power to live a life more to your liking. Dr. Dyer never says breaking destructive habits is easy, but he does provide a very workable plan if you decide you want more joy and less pain.  ",0

"The type of improvisation in which Keith Jarrett excels is, at its best, a wonderful experience. It is, however, also full of suspense, because along the performance there are always points in which he seems to have lost his way. People who listen to his probings in all directions until he finds a way out  are unavoidably left in anxious expectation - will he get away with it, this time? He always seems to do, that is what we wish and what we have come to expect from him, but there is this unpleasant fear, as if we were parents watching their  child`s debut on the scene. Amazingly enough, this anguish at the ""lost"" phase does not disappear when we listen to the CD repeatedly, but it also makes the final liberation an unforgettable experience every time. So the various people who reviewed this CD before me were all right in their apparently disparate judgments. It is wonderful, and it is exhasperating. It does feel like a lonely tree that has survived a tempest, as a reviewer put it, but it is frustrating to those who would like it to be easier to listen, as others have pointed out. The reviewer who said the creative strain will become clearer with each listening was also right. Because there is a lot of probing, and a very slowly emerging solution, the evolution of melody is hardly perceptible for a while, but listening to it repeatedly reveals the uniqueness of Jarrett`s creativity. No wonder he considers it to be his best work - it sounds as a real battle with inspiration, and a victorious one",0

"This is a very mediocre Knights Kingdom set.  There's not much of interest going on here, and the small castle suffers from lazy design.The colorful Knights Of Morcia are back, once again fighting against Vladek, the black knight.  Two of the good knights make an appearance here (blue and purple), and we also get Vladek, a dark soldier, and a skeleton.  The minifigs are as charismatic as ever, each sporting his own unique expression.  Vladek and his henchman have that cute ""I'm evil"" Lego frown.  Our knights are outfitted with the usual accessories.  Swords and shields, and a black hatchet for the henchman.The scene is a small mountainside castle that is home to a large scorpion monster.  The creature is constructed from a mixture of regular and Technic parts, and he has hinged pieces for an articulated tail and pincers.  The blue knight is accompanied by his horse, who has a cute mini-catapult strapped to his side.The scorpion can fit into his den at the base of the castle, which has a front gate that can be raised and lowered.  High atop the tower is a mini-catapult and a thin boom crane with a small barred jail cell dangling precariously from it.  The rest of the castle is just walls, floors, and a staircase.  This castle is very fragile.  Mine fell apart several times while I was working on building it.  On the whole, the design just isn't all that great.  Handle with care, and play with care.  Colors are mostly black, dark gray, dark red, and brown.  This set has one of those nice walls with the barred window, and some signature Knights Kingdom battlement pieces.This set works as an addition to Vladek's Dark Fortress.  On its own, it's stunningly less impressive.  The good news is that a savvy Lego Maniac can take the castle parts and build a better castle with them.My verdict:  one thumb up for the scorpion monster (who can be added to your other Knights Kingdom adventures), one thumb down for the rest.  Could've been better.  My advice is to get Vladek's Dark Fortress.  It's more than worth the price of admission.  For those still hungering for more Knights Kingdom action after Vladek's fortress has been built and conquered, this set is better than nothing",0

"This critically acclaimed set of short stories from Junot Diaz is at best a childish diary that was put together by incompetent editors desperate to publish anything that sounds remotely different from the monumental garbage that they continously publish every year.The writer's main preoccupation seems to be channeling his anger about his absentee, unfaithful father and the effects on his mother in the Dominican Republic. This would be fine if it didn't read like some troubled child's diary. The writer repeatedly throws in spanish slang and sayings which I felt were used just to prove to his readers that he's bilingual as they add absolutely nothing to the plot or story, not there's any in any of the stories anyway.The stories end abruptly, they're worst than mediocre, and he doesn't use quotations to separate his terrible dialouge. The reviews for the book were excellent but that should be expected from unqualified writers such as Junot Diaz. Critics only praise books that deal with tormented souls who use their depravity to channel it into elementary and generic prose. One must be aware that the writer is an MFA in literature, which just proves how lackluster American Higher Education has become. A terrible read",1

"""A Slight Case of Murder"" is a very funny and affectionate treatment of post-prohibition gangster life. When prohibition is repealed, bootlegger and gang boss Remy Marco (Edward G. Robinson) decides to go 'legit' and open a brewery. Unfortunately, what Marco fails to realize is that his rotgut beer--dubbed Goldvelvet--may have sold during prohibition, but once alcohol becomes legal and customers have choices, sales plummet.After an opening sequence covering Marco's decision to go 'legit', the film picks up several years later. Marco is now leading the honest life of a brewery owner, but he's struggling with mounting debts and a failing business. Unfortunately, Marco isn't much of an honest businessman, and he's shocked when he learns that the bank is about to call in an outstanding half a million-dollar loan. Most of the film takes place in Marco's large home in the country. Marco's daughter Mary (Jane Bryan) has just returned from a posh European finishing school as Marco can no longer pay the bills. Marco, his wife Nora (Ruth Donnelly) and daughter travel to the country home--along with a delinquent from Marco's ""alma mater""--the city orphanage. It's Marco's tradition to take an orphan to his home for the summer, and this year, he has requested the worst one of the bunch so that he can reform the lad. Also converging on Marco's home is Mary's new fiance, Dick Whitewood (Willard Parker), his snobby, blueblood father (Paul Harvey), and a gang hotfoot from an armored car robbery. All these forces combine to make a very funny, entertaining film, and if you're a fan of Edward G. Robinson, you'll find ""A Slight Case of Murder"" delightful. Most of the fun comes from the way in which the film, directed by Lloyd Bacon, depicts the criminal element attempting to go straight. Marco's former gang members are now all part of his entourage and this works with varying degrees of success. Marco's wife--a former gang moll--shifts back and forth between accents as she slips in and out of her roles as society wife and tough broad. Meanwhile, there's Marco, who was a successful bootlegger, and now finds himself outmaneuvered by predatory bank officials. Some of the very funniest scenes occur when Mr. Whitewood goes to meet the Marco family. Whitewood's priceless reactions to his soon-to be new in-laws reflect shock and horror. The DVD print looks good, and there are no problems with it. Extras include: vintage newsreel, the short feature ""Declaration of Independence"", the classic cartoon ""The Night Watchman"", original trailers, commentary by film historian Robert Sklar, and a featurette: ""Prohibition Opens the Floodgates""--displacedhuma",0
"I think producer Mo Ramchandani should be commended for his integrity in honestly reviewing his own film.  This is rare in an industry that is proliferated with bald old men who are more interested in turning a profit than producing a good film.  This was by far the worst film i have ever seen, i urge anybody on this page not to waste their time.  Director Sean Mcginly should have been fired on the first day of shooting and replaced with anyone, even a farm animal, and then maybe the psycholgical complexities of suicide would have been better explored.

"This beautifully illustrated book is an engaging tale about a little hermit crab that travels to various real-life destinations looking for a new shell (because Hermy has outgrown his old shell).  Like most children, my kids (ages 8, 6 and 4) love the beach, and they were captivated by the Hermy story and illustrations.  The main character is a hermit crab, but the cast of characters includes some other ocean favorites, such as a sand dollar and a sea horse.  The lighthouse and shipwreck captured my son's attention.  The innovative format includes a map of Hermy's journey, and an informative &quot;Hermy's Beachside Glossary&quot; that answered many questions that my children had.  There is also a detailed write-up of the biology of the hermit crab included at the end, which provided enrichment for my 8-year-old and me!  My children are avid readers and it is often difficult to find new books that capture their attention---Hermy the Hermit Crab was a welcome, rare find.  We have given this book to other kids for a birthay present, and it was a winner",1
"This is one of the best books I have ever read on the Revolutionary War.  Even though it is technically classified as a novel, it is accurately presented history. Mr. Shaara obviously did a lot of research for this book, and presented the historical events accurately, as well as presenting dialogue in such a way that it was totally believable.  The main participants in the Revolutionary War were presented not as gods, but as truly great and courageous men and women.  He also presented the details of battles, troop movements, condition of troops, and maps of battle locations in such a way that the reader is completely captivated and a vicarious participant in the events.  I have a better understanding of the Revolutionary War years than I have ever had, and would highly recommend this book to every American who would like to have a better understanding of the founding of our wonderful country.

"At 512 pages, ""Palace Walk"" is a carefully detailed domestic drama that proceeds at a leisurely pace, exploring the day-to-day life of a WWI-era family and eventually the impact of larger political events as Egypt struggles for independence from British rule. Much of the novel concerns the conflicts between an authoritarian family patriarch, his submissive wife, and his young sons and daughters, whose own struggles for independence mirror the rise of nationalistic spirit that erupts in street demonstrations and strikes.For Western readers, the novel is an introduction to the values and dynamics of the traditional Islamic family, where ""respectable"" women are housebound, and only boys and men are free to get an education and find employment. The novel also reveals the double standard that permits men to be less than faithful to their wives, while skillfully maintaining an honorable reputation and keeping a firm grip on the moral high ground at home. Meanwhile, the novel reveals how thoroughly Islamic beliefs infuse daily life and social values.Reviewers here look for comparisons to the Grand Masters of fiction (Dickens Dostoyevsky, etc.). But for me, the daily routines of home life, the rivalries between siblings, the worried concern of marriage for two daughters (one pretty, one plain), coming-of-age affairs of the heart, the threat of divorce, and chapters devoted to other such matters make this novel much in the tradition of Jane Austen. A difference, however, is that surprise events at its close raise new concerns that are left unresolved, and propel the reader onward to the next novel in this wonderful and very readable trilogy",1
"Reading through John Irving's ""The Cider House Rules,"" I found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity. In obtaining a bachelor's degree in English, I had to read a lot of books. Among them were many books that I did not like, but never before had I read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety. Every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along. People become pregnant, have abortions, and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens. This goes way beyond mere foreshadowing. The book doesn't flow naturally, you can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows, playing the puppet master. There are just so many coincidences, so many old friends just happening to run into eachother, so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly, all of the characters vaguely, distantly connected to eachother. I don't want to spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the Eames (rhymes with screams) family is just too much coincidence to bear. It's as though the author is God, and the characters completely lack free will.And then there's the ""protagonist,"" Homer Wells. I put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story, Homer Wells barely does anything in the story. He barely even speaks during the story. He is virtually a non-character, devoid of personality or will, around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve. The scenes that do not involve Homer Wells at all, and they make up the majority of the book, are without fail the most interesting scenes. I think that the real protagonist of the book is Dr. Larch, but even Melony seems more real than Homer does. The story is very long and rambling. Subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on. Minor characters keep popping into the story, then disappearing, only to pop back into the story exactly when they're needed. Conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten (like the situation with Debra Pettigrew). After such a rambling, at times rather boring plot, the ending feels rather rushed. It is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything, tie up every loose end, in the last 25 pages (and tying up loose ends, in this case, means a lot of people conveniently dying). To spoil the plot just a little, Homer Wells, who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul, suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion. I personally am pro-choice as well, but I found that Homer's sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily-ever-afters",1
"This little book read like a novel. It helped me understand better what I already knew and opened my eyes on aspects I was not aware of.

"Lizzy Enders is ripped to pieces with grief after losing her very sick mother on the Santa Fe trail. But she is even sicker when her father abandons her along the way- at a Catholic boarding school run entirely by nuns. She is a Methodist, and the other girls look down upon her. She is also stuck sharing a room with her horrible cousin, who can only think about herself. While trying to understand the ways of the strict Catholic church, Lizzy is asked to accompany a strange lady who lives at the convent up to her son's grave each day. She learns more from this lady than she could immagine. But when she and her cousin, Eleanorea, end jup in the town on an escapade in the middle of the night, Lizzy meets a carpenter, desperately in need of a job. Lizzy gets a strange feeling about the man. She knows the church needs a staircase up to the choir loft built, so invites him to come talk to the nuns. She forms a tight bond with the man, who preforms one of the most famous miracles in history before he vanishes. Lizzy is wrapped up in a whirlwind of excitement around every corner.A very good book. It was a little descriminative against Catholics in my opinion, but that takes little away from the book itself. An all-around great story",1

"I'm pleasantly surprised at the depth of wisdom and advice Ellen has packed into this Software Requirements Memory Jogger. While this little book can't say everything about software requirements, the breadth of techniques, tips and advice it does contain, are quite astounding. It is process neutral and puts together in one place many different techniques and practices.It really does cover requirements techniques, practices and principles from A to Z. Chapter 1 provides an Overview of Software Requirements. Chapter 2, Setting the Stage, discusses vision statements, glossaries, and risk mitigation strategies; Chapter 3, Elicit the Requirements, talks about facilitated workshops, exploratory prototypes, focus groups and user task analysis (among other techniques); Analyze the Requirements, Chapter 4, covers everything from Process Maps and Business Rules, to State Diagrams,Use Cases, Personas, and Dialog Maps; Specify the Requirements, Chapter 5, gives nuts and bolts advice on how to structure a req'ts doc and write functional and non-functional req'ts; Validate the Requirements, Chapter 6, explains peer reviews, user acceptance tests,and operational prototypes; Manage the Requirements, Chapter 7, covers change control policies and requirements attributes; and Chapter 8 discusses Adapting Requirements Practices to Project Types. But wait! The appendices are valuable, too. Thumbing through them I was pleasantly surprised to see an extensive list  of Verbs to use for Informative Use Case Names, and verbs to use for performative use cases in Appendix C...as well as  a list of 100 ambiguous words and phrases to avoid when describing quality attributes (my favorites are Simple, Rapid,and Intuitive) in Appendix F.My only quibble with this memory jogger is that I'd like to have had slightly larger (standard book size) format companion available to go into some areas in more depth. Maybe that's Ellen's next book",1

"Pros: High quality construction, nothing about it feels cheap. Comes with the lens hood. Has great telephoto capability. Excellent price for a starter telephoto lens.Cons: Quite a bit of chromatic abberation around the edges at 200mm-300mm. You'll definately want to use a tripod for this for anything above 100mm since there is no IS.Overall, if you want a lens simply because you want a wide range and the ability to zoom far in get this. If you want QUALITY pictures however, look elsewhere. I'm thinking of spending ~$500 on one of Canon's Image Stabilization lenses",0

"I have an entire set of Swiss Diamond in addition to this pan. I bought Swiss Diamond because, due to weak wrists, I needed sturdy cookware that was not as heavy as stainless steel. Because aluminum is the primary, affordable, lighter-weight alternative, and one does not want food coming in contact with aluminum because of the possible leaching of it into the food, I sought non-stick pans with a coating that would not flake or scratch off and end up in my food. After much research, I discovered Swiss Diamond. I have not been disappointed. The pans are a great weight--hefty without being too heavy, and after several months of use, the coating is holding up beautifully. I confess that I do not primarily use metal utensils in it, however, so I can't testify about how they hold up against metal. These pans caramelize food beautifully, and the evenness of the heat distribution in them is a pure joy. They do take a few extra seconds to heat up, but hold heat very well. I really love how flat the pan's bottom is, and imagine if you have a flush electric cooktop, these would be especially appreciated. Though I have a gas range, I had trouble in the past with pots and pans slipping and sliding on the enameled grates, but these pans do not slide. And I was delighted to discover, after realizing I had accidentally left this pan on low heat for an hour with no food in it, it did not warp at all and is still in perfect condition. This cookware cleans up easily and perfectly, too. I love that they are coated on the outside walls of the pans so any dried or cooked on food comes off the outside as easily as the inside.One thing to note is that if you are looking for a pan to cook eggs in without oil, this may not be your best choice. The texture of the diamond coating seems to grab more than a slick Teflon pan would, and the first time I tried to flip my fried eggs without a spatula, I had less than stellar results. But with sufficient oil, I can flip the eggs without a spatula or a problem (I need to make my daily quota of coconut oil anyway for health reasons, so I'm fine with putting oil in the pan). If you use a spatula, you should easily be able to flip eggs without oil.I do hope these pans turn out to be durable over the years. So far, after a few months, they are aces! In fact, my husband may be growing weary of my exclaiming, ""I LOVE this cookware!"" over and over again.",0
I bought the whole superyard play yard kit and absolutely loved it. The extra extensions you can buy for it are great. I have it set up in a living room to keep my son from getting near my entertainment center and leaving my living room. I found it to be very durable and sturdy. When my son was younger it worked great as a place for him to play in. As he got a little older and became more mobile I set the play yard up in my living room to keep him from getting close to my television set. You can bend the pieces to form almost any design you choose. I would say that if you child is getting close to 3 years old not to buy this though. It's sturdy but probably not for that age. It can also be used as a place to put your pet in and can be used outside. I'd recommend this highly,0

"Whether you are trying to maintain already great skin or wanting to improve the complexion you have now, this book offers terrific advice and some excellent dietary and supplemental programs. Dr. Perricone's opinion that aging is a disease like any other (and therefore treatable)  is novel and not without some supporting evidence. His suggestions on starting young to keep your skin well-toned are invaluable. I read this book end to end and didn't find anything to really object to and there was a lot here that merits serious attention. This is a good program for maximizing what nature gave you and bettering it through all natural, non-cosmetic remedies. Whereas the typical American response to skin care has been ""clean and cover"" this shows it is possible to build a healthy foundation from within. The best book in this field on the market today",1

"(Husband writing review:) I bought the Lodge Sportsman Grill last year, and I get a lot of use out of it. It's perfect for a couple of steaks or burgers -- plenty of room for a meal for two. Also steams plenty of veggies in a foil pouch, or grills corn on the cob. I had an old hibachi years ago, but this has three times the grill size, and it's solidly built. Can even do indirect cooking with it. I added a stainless steel sauce pan for water that fits on one side with the coals on the other side, so it has that much versatility. Although it's heavy, that's good. I can still take it to the lake and set it on a concrete picnic table without taking up a lot of space in the vehicle. Baby it a bit to keep the rust down, and you can expect this grill to be a workhorse for you for years to come. And get the tough fabric cover Lodge sells - will help keep it clean when it's not in use. (PS: I don't work for Lodge, either.",0
"This is a really terrific book, confronting some of the most urgent questions in our world today. Is secular feminism a purely Western phenomenon? is religious fundamentalism always at odds with women's equality? should American power be used to free women in other countries, as Bush claimed he was freeing Afghani women from the Taliban?  With fundamentalist Islam -- and repression of women -- on the rise in post-war Iraq, and fundamentalist Christians opposed to women's freedom of choice running the USA, the questions this book raises are tragically timely. The authors bring fascinatingly diverse perspectives to the table. Some are strongly committed to the secular, others committed to  more humane, egalitarian interpretations of their faith. This book contains writing by some of  the sharpest  living female intellectuals,  and represents  a wide range of experiences, political and religious views and nationalities. Betsy Reed has done a wonderful job of culling and shaping this work into a beautifully conversational whole. Katha Pollitt's introduction is, like all her writing, brilliant: elegantly irreverent and clear-headed. Provocative and absorbing -- everyone should find something to disagree with! Buy it now!!!",1

"I switched from the Digital Rebel XT. Since I already had L-glass lenses, I didn't run into problems with the 5D ""exposing"" cheaper lenses. The 17-40mm really shines on the full sensor! The burst rate is simply astonishing. Missing flash doesn't bother me, heck it's a $3000 camera, I don't expect a built-in flash. I have the Speedlite 580EX, which of course is wonderful in itself. I also have the battery grip which I recommend, as well as the RS-80N3 cable release. Image quality is superb overall - the 5D REALLY shines in high ISO numbers - more so than even the 1D from what I've read. Even at 1600 there's hardly any noise. It allows you to take great, crisp photos in low light where other cameras would require a flash. The camera also is quite light while being very sturdy at the same time. The 3 fps might bother some, but I prefer the incredible burst numbers.",0
"Snyder provides a thorough survey and sound evaluation of the documentary and archaeological evidence for the Fifth and Sixth Centuries in Britain.  These two centuries are the &quot;lost&quot; period in British history,  lying between the better-known Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods.  Snyder  provides insight into a period of great changes and adaptations, showing  how Roman era political and social institutions and concepts were  transformed to deal with altered circumstances. In a sense, Snyder's work  could be seen as a partial update of the invaluable _Arthur's Britain_ by  Leslie Alcock.  &quot;Partial&quot; because Snyder intentionally deals only  with those surviving documents that are contemporary to the period (e.g.,  St. Patrick, Gildas, Life of Saint Germanus).  He deliberately avoids the  accounts of this period which were written in slightly later times (e.g.,  Bede, Annales Cambriae, Nennius, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle).  These later  sources are based upon early documents (since lost) and oral tradition, and  are therefore more problematic than the contemporary documents.  Snyder  thus carefully avoids the controversy surrounding the question of the  historical basis for the King Arthur legend.  This omission does not,  however, render his work less valuable to Arthurian enthusiasts; to the  contrary, it provides a firm factual foundation from which those daring  souls may approach the more problematic material and tackle the Arthurian  controvers",1
"When I was growing up THE 3 WORLDS OF GULLIVER was one of my first films that I became enchanted with when I started making the transition from cartoons to live action movies. One thing that always stood out in this movie was the music. When I listened to this recording it really brought back memories. I really like Bernard Herrmann's scores that he wrote for fantasy films. The Royal Scottish National Orchestra did a fine job on this recording. I think what sets this recording apart from Herrmann's other fantasy scores was that he was able to develop music for the different fantastic settings that Gulliver was confronted with, yet he always reminded us musically of Gulliver's love of country and his fair lady in these various interludes. Joel McNeely seems to have captured Herrmann's intent ever so fervently and reverently",0

"I have owned this unit for about a week now, and it works like a charm!  It has three sets of pre-outs which I am using for two MA amps, and a subwoofer.  The unit also allows you to infinitely adjust low, mid, and high frequencies - while selecting the kHz. or Hz -, and even which phase your subwoofer is in - OR you can select 16 different EQ modes, which is what I did.The unit can also control a multi CD player, a DSP unit, a Navigation unit, Sirius or XM radio...none of which I purchased.I did however, purchase the separate iPod adapter - which I recommend with reservations- see my review of the CD IB1002 - it interfaces with the touch screen and gives you the ability to scroll through or 'search' for songs just like you would on your iPod - although the scroll is a bit slow for my liking...in addition, the adapter charges your iPod.The touch screen makes it easy to navigate through the menus, which are very intuitive.  You can also select to have the screen 'pop up' automatically when the car is turned on (it also retracts when the car is turned off), or you can set it up to open and close manually.You can also adjust the tilt of the screen and adjust color, brightness, etc.The unit has many, many adjustments (too many to list) for sound, picture, and parental control.I find the unit very easy to use, and would highly recommend it to anyone",0

"This review is about the Applewood reprint edition of the Tower Treasure.  Revision of the Hardy Boys mysteries began in 1959 with the revision of Tower Treasure and a few other titles.  We are very fortunate that Applewood has published the original text of the first 15 Hardy Boys stories.  This is the first time readers have had the chance to read the original text of The Tower Treasure in 40+ years.  This original text story is richer than the revised text version.  Most notable is the inclusion of humor, but character development is also more in depth than the more modern stories.  Subplots are also used more freely.  This is an enjoyable read.  Adults under 50 have probably not read this version of Tower Treasure, so it will be a revelation",1

"I had not read much from this author except her 4 book series with Beverly LaHaye, but when our library had this one in large print, I just picked it up ""accidentally"" and decided to read it. I had not gotten into many pages when I was grabbed by the plot.I did not even know there WAS a second chance series and I rather wondered how a secular book could be re-written sucessfully as a Christian Fiction book, but this one was wonderful.When Wes first met Laney, he suspected her of being a stalker and/or kidnapper of children, and he had her arrested. His fears seemed rational until he heard her story. The child of Wes and his deceased wife Patrice, was adopted right after birth, and Laney, the birth mother had finally found them through illegal means. The story then unfolds of two people who have absolutely nothing in common except their love for one little girl, Amy. Through it all the ghost of Wes' dead wife Patrice hangs heavily over both their heads as well as Amy's. I felt Terri Blackstock drew upon some incredible experience as an author to format and carry through with this suspenseful, love-hate story and the twists and turns which led to a very, very strange and almost unbelievable bond between Wes and Laney.I wish to thank the author for re-writing this book and for using her talent for her new ""boss"", God. I am now searching for other second chances books by this author. ",1
"This book certainly deserves the praise that has been lavished upon it. The integration of psychological and spiritual principles into life and business is the key to mastering your life. Can you be successful without doing so? Yes, since success is subjective you certainly can. But what kind of a life will you construct for yourself? I have seen countless highly successful academics and business people who are utterly miserable because their lives have neither purpose nor meaning. They ache, but often have no idea why. This book is a marvelous antidote for that kind of sterile existence.This book is packed with practical exercises for the constructive modifications of your mental models: the core constructs and core desires that usually run our lives. This is a book about empowerment and integration. You do not need to become a corporate mystic, but you will likely feel a much greater sense of personal control and from that flows personal mastery. This book is one of a growing number of attempts to introduce spiritual principles into daily life.There is an excellent annotated reading list at the back of the bookI rather wish that I had known about Professor Rao's work when I was working on my last book!Highly recommended",1

"The Paris Michelin Green Guide was invaluable for my last visit to France. When I was a kid and lived in Paris we used to have one of these as well and I ordered the updated one this summer before going on my first trip back since I was a teenager. I highly recommend the book for those who want a detailed arrondisement and museum guide on everything there is to do in Paris. Since I lived there, I wanted something that would give me specific details on smaller, lesser known museums as well. This guide does a fabulous job of that. However, if you are a first timer to Paris and France and/or have only a few short days there I am not sure this is the guide for you - you might be better off with an Eyewitness guide or Lonely Planet Guide that will tell you what to see if you only have a short time period to work with. If you have been before or are spending a while in the city this is the guide you want - it will list places you have never even heard of before with details about times/days open (very important to know in Paris!!) and phone numbers, prices, etc etc with mini maps on each area of Paris",1

This gel held my brows in place all day without a single stray. No flaking! No stiff brows!And it is so easy to apply. It comes with a mascara style brush that you simply whisk over your brows to style and keep them where you want them. It stays all day and comes off easily with make up remover. Browmousse is a definite step up from all other brands I've tried. I will recommend this product to all my friends.",0

"Village of Dreams is simply enchanting.  It vividly captures the heat of summer in postwar Japan as two identical twin brothers explore life in and around their village, get into all sorts of trouble with adults, and  interact with each other.  The viewer is soon swept into their world, a  world where you are challenged in 112 minutes to listen for the crickets,  smell the oppressive heat, taste their mom's cooking, and revel with them  as they grow up sensing for the first time changes in themselves and their  surroundings.  Mieko Harada the actress who plays the twin's mother won the  equivilent of an Academy Award for this portrayal.  Many of us remember her  as the villianess in Akira Kurosawa's RAN, what a different part this time.   This film is highly recommended as an escape to another time, our lost  childhood.  Sit back, relax, let your senses envelope you, and enjoy  VILLAGE OF DREAM",0
This movie is really great. I LOVED IT!! I won't give away any of it because it would probably give away too much. GO SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S GREAT and FUNNY!!!!!! DEFINETLY A MUST SEE!!,0

"I ABSOLUTELY loved this book! It is enchanting from start to finish and teaches so much about the elemental realms. It is also recommened by Doreen Virtue for incarnated elementals, but even if you're not one and have an intrigue for these realms you will adore it! It is much better than the Elves of Lily Hill Farm, which is worth reading too, but not as good as this one",1

"First off, if you're a Tortoise fan and are expecting some kind of comprehensive, best of overview, well think again. I do want to say however that the music included in this compilation is indeed awesome. You have some very early, more rare material, all the long deleted remix collaborations, all so well done, and a very artful, visually pleasing dvd showing some excellent concert footage, music videos, and more. All this for under twenty dollars, plus some beautiful packaging. Again, it seems the first reviewer here thought this to be some sort of greatest hits box set or something, and thus his opinion soured. Don't listen to him--listen to the music and simply enjoy",0

"10+ Stars!Wow! How do I put into words my true enthusiasm and excitement for something so great as This BOOK!!  I just got through reading the last word on page 312 and couldn't wait to run to the computer and write a review about it.  Dana, I have to tell you... when I started reading this book, I thought to myself ""hey, this chic doesn't have DR. in front of her name so what makes her so special to write a book about how I should control my diet?""  Boy, I'm eating crow pie (low carb of course) right now!  You are a complete WHIZ when it comes to articulating and simplifying the science of the Low Carb World! I'm taking a bow of appreciation right now in your honor.  You have done your research and then some.  I picked up on pieces of health info that I have read in other books that only real crazies like me like to read.  We health book reading crazies have to stick together!! I really enjoyed reading chapter 23 about Exercise.  It so ME!  A gym drop out.  How can someone fail jump roping? Well, I'm here to say that someone can and did! Yep, I failed it big time!! Dana, I know your pain when it comes to past memories of gym class.This book such a nice change from all the deep, scientific, mumbo jumbo that all the other's right about.  They can get so sterile with it all.  You on the other hand kept it ""REAL"" and I really appreciate that.  It almost read like a novel.  I couldn't put it down and loved how you gave your personal experiences all through out the book.  Please write another one!! Pretty Please!!  For those who haven't read it yet... DON'T WASTE ANOTHER MINUTE! BUY THE BOOK NOW AND DON'T WAIT TO READ IT ONCE IT ARRIVES IN THE MAIL!! If you already own the book, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??  Stop reading the damn reviews and pick up the book and start reading!!  This book explains EVERYTHING you MUST know about Low Carb Eating.  My husband and I have read till we are blue in the face all the ""other"" low carb books and you just about have to force yourself to get through each and every page.  Not Dana's book!  Nope, I raced right through it and will be rereading it this week just in case I missed something the first time.  Note:  I have NEVER read the same book more than once, so this is really saying something!Now I'm going to Dana's website to try to soak up as much goodness there as possible.  Dana, You are a Godsend! I Love the book and I love YOU for writing it. Also purchasing ALL of the cookbooks ASAP (which will be right after I post this review.) If this book was this good, I can't wait to get the cookbooks!  Thanks a million x a million!!!!Jennifer in Dallas, Texas p.s.  It does feel like a ""zillion degrees"" here in the summer time!

"""Unlimited Power"" by Anthony Robbins is about success.... period.  Whether it is success in your marriage, finances, professional career, relationships... everything is covered in this book.  The basis of part 1 is modeling.  Author Anthony Robbins states that success leaves patterns.  And if you copy those patterns, you too will achieve success.  From this premise, Robbins goes on to teach exactly how to model successful behavior through several techniques.  Some of the techniques include; the ""Swish"" pattern where you take a behavior you want to change and you create a link to a new, positive behavior, ""Strategy Elicitation"" which involves determining the exactly mindset of successful people, and modeling physiology to create the emotional state you need in order to be happy and successful.Part 2 is about the Ultimate Success Formula, or what do you want?  Without having a clear direction, it really doesn't matter how much effort you put in so part 2 includes section on goal setting, learning to develop rapport with people, and metaprograms or learning to address someone in the right key.Part 3 focuses on leadership. Essentially this states that if what you want is not in line with your deepest values, then you will never live a completely fulfilled life.  In all, I found this book to be fantastic.  Anthony Robbins does a fantastic job of getting to the point and breaking down barriers but in a way that is both sensitive and caring.  The exercises take some work, but I am certain that they are worth it.  This is definitely a book you are going to want to pick up and one that you are going to want to read several times.  5 out of 5 stars",1

"this is quite a sharp turn from francine's previous album (40 on a fall day)... whereas the last album was closer sonically to frontman clayton scoble's work in poundcake, this time around it's quieter, subtler, sweeter and sadder. make no mistake, this is a break-up album. even those songs that make no mention of breaking up leave you with that cold, lonely, hug-craving feeling only the best break-up albums can.the mood will draw you in and keep you listening, but after a few listens it's the songs you'll fall in love with. ahh, the songs. they're densely packed with chord changes, odd but appealing lyrics, and unexpected instrumentation. they're hooky without being obvious (a francine specialty). this was my favourite album of 2003, and i still listen to it pretty often these days.best tracks: this sunday's revival, silver plated 606, novelty, 13 years.best lyric: ""read a year old mail / now you should've told me / i've been repeating myself / only far less convincingly",0
"If flash cards are your best way of learning something, here's clearly what you've been looking for. Of course you also have to be interested in the Cisco routing/switching philosophy. Specifically this set of 500+ flash cards is oriented around exam 350-001. This book is made up of flash cards, yes, the kind you used to make in high school. If, of course, you are more computer minded, you might want to use the CD ROM instead. It has all of the flash cards along with the ability to shuffle the cards and to take a practice examination on your own PC. This is not a common form of book, but like I said earlier, if flash cards are your thing, this is the book for you.",1

"I had the good fortune to work within a few blocks of Buttercup Bake Shop and often stopped in to take oodles of cupcakes back to my ever appreciative coworkers -- a lovely tradition.  These baked goods are to die for.  (It did get annoying that they would limit how many they would sell at a time, but if I had another coworker there they could get the extras I couldn't by just getting next in line -- it was annoying.)  That's my ONLY fault with this place though, and now that I'm back in California I'm thrilled to at least have the book so I can make some myself.  If in the neighborhood and you're a cook, check out Bridge Kitchen Ware as well -- they have a wonderful catalog.  ENJOY",1

"Reviewed by Paige Lovitt for Reader Views (4/06)""The Fun Factor: Your Prescription for Stress Relief at Home"" really provided me with a lot of insight into the value of humor.  It also was interesting to see how humor can be abused.  The author, Cheryl Nason, M.Ed., gives an interesting background on humor, including its history which she included back into biblical times.  She also writes about cultures that saw the use of humor as sin.Nason presents compelling information on why humor is useful at work and in learning situations.  It is also valuable as a therapeutic tool.  She offers ideas on how it can be utilized in ways that are beneficial at work, such as when trying to convince others to accept a new concept.  She also discusses the etiquette that should be followed when utilizing humor as a tool.  If humor is used inappropriately it can really affect a person's opinion about the presenter, causing the presenter to lose his audience. Nason wrote this book in an easy to follow format.  I found it useful to read just for myself, however, it is also written in a format that could be used by groups in continuing education settings.  I would recommend it to those who are interested in the subject, the background information is really fascinating. I also recommend it to anyone who enjoys using humor in their presentations and would like to incorporate it in a way to be a more effective tool.",1
"This is the mini that brought me back to comics after a ten year hiatus. A great story highlighting 3 of comics underappreciated genii: Dixon, Bogdanove, and Nowlan. Don't expect continuity shifting outcomes from a cross-over mini, but do expect a look at some of Kirby's classic characters and Superman cavorting in some amazing settings and in a fun adventure. A great introduction to the New Gods",1
"Tipler says that he used to be an unquestioning atheist, but his work in quantum cosmology has brought him to the conclusion that there is a physically justifiable theory of how ""God"" and ""immortality after death"" might make sense. I only skimmed the book, but I have to say that, as a physicist, I was surprised to find the quality of his arguments to be a lot better than I expected.(Talk about having ""proved"" the existence of God is greatly overstated. It would be more accurate to say that, if certain physical conditions could be shown to hold, then the existence of something vaguely like God might be remotely plausible based on his arguments. But see the end of this review.)The compressed version of the theory is... Tipler (as I do) subscribes to the ""strong Artificial Intelligence"" belief that if you translated the dynamics of what goes on in our brains into another medium (e.g., a futuristic computer), in a sense it wouldn't make any difference -- our ""emulated"" selves would be as conscious and real as we are. He outlines a scenario under which, in a closed universe, in the final moments of the universe, there could be an infinite amount of computing that occurs. So much in fact, that all the human lives that ever occurred (or ever could have occurred) could be emulated through infinite subjective time. The computing entities that exist at the end of the universe would get there via exponentially replicating intelligent machines that we (or conceivably another intelligent race) send out into the universe. Based on game theory and economic arguments, he makes it plausible that the intelligences at the end of the universe would be highly altruistic. And then based on quantum cosmology, he argues for bidirectional causality between here and the end of the universe (I haven't digested that argument).Not exactly something most traditionally religious folks would recognize. But, as a theory of how ""God"" and physics could be merged, to my mind it's pretty brilliant. (Doesn't mean it's right.)Note, however, that the book was written in the early 90's. Tipler provides some experimental tests one can do to assess whether or not we're in a universe where the conditions are right to make his scenario possible. One of the most important tests -- verification that we're in a closed universe -- has already been answered (we seem to be in a defiantly open universe) in a way that implies we are NOT in a universe where Tipler's scenario could hold true.Still, very interesting reading",1
"When my husband and I came across this book a couple years ago, we were in a pretty bad spot. The strain of both of us working and trying to raise a family had brought us to the edge of a very unhappy place, and we were unsure of where to turn. In our daily lives, we had forgotten how to connect with one another, even how to communicate effectively about anything except our children. This book helped us to rekindle our lost identities, as well as our strength as a couple. The questions at the end of each day's readings encouraged us to listen to one another. I recommend this book 100%. We passed our copy on to another couple who will hopefully be helped through their own trials.",1

"Bessie Smith had one of the most powerfull, expressive and recognizable voices of the 20th Century. Her talent as a vocalist in the studio, as well as her stage performance made her a star that changed the way of music forever. This collection of 36 Bessie's classic recordings is simply one of the best, and most comprehensive collections of her work. It is, as other reviewers said, surely missing a handful of records that could also be considered Essential, but this collection never-the-less, hits the spot for any casucal fan or even the most avid devourer of Bessie Smith's music. The 2 Disc set is Essential Bessie, and also, Essential - period. ",0
"This edition of the Classics of Western Spirituality series includes several works attributed to the writer of the cloud of unknowing.  These include Counsels on Private Direction, a Direction on Prayer, a translation of Dionysius the Aeropagite's 'Mystical Theology', a work on Discerning Spirits and other short treatises on the contemplative life.    As with the Cloud of Unknowing, the short works are written to help guide young contemplatives through the process of knowing God through the mystical process of 'letting go' of all concepts and images of God, the classic 'via negativa' way of mystical theology.  The Pursuit of Wisdom especially is a sequel to the Cloud, designed for the more advanced contemplation of God after the steps outlined in the Cloud have been mastered.  The author retains the same sense of balance and sensibility as he did in the cloud, and these works only reinforce his well earned reputation as one of the finest writers on contemplative spirituality in the Catholic tradition.   This edition includes some excellent notes and also an introduction to the author's thought and influences, and seperate introductions to each work",1

"""Shattered Air,"" is a rare book.  While most stories of this type center on a disaster and then move on, this tale provides a two-decade character study of all major players; most of whom readers will grow to understand and perhaps empathize with.  Beginning with an introduction to the story's initial anti-heroes, we are shown how they have naively intertwined recklessness with outdoor adventure.  Years later we watch in horror as their charmed lives have enticed innocent others into following them onto Yosemite's Half Dome during a thunderstorm. What follows is the detailing of the heroic efforts to rescue lightning struck victims by hikers, rangers, and medical personal.  This is a cautionary tale to all would-be daredevils, detailing how death  and debilitating injuries haunts not only them, but everyone left in their wake",1
Sharon Patton does a wonderful job placing African-American art and artist within the contex of the time in which it was made.

It is easy to read and flows more like a story of art instead of a dry lecture,1

"If 'art' can be defined as a view of the world or reaction or politicizing or representational through the many guises of that term as perceived by one who paints, sculpts, photographs, or draws, then the premise that 'comics' or 'cartoons' deserve the stature of an art form is certainly a viable decision.  This large and generously illustrated volume, produced to accompany a museum exhibition, is probably as fine a treatise as is currently available, and if the book is representative of the exhibition to soon follow at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, then expectations can be justifiably high.Editors/curators John Carlin, Paul Karasik, and Brian Walker  have complied a group of 15 comic artists, those whose works have been significantly before the public since the 1940's.  By limiting the number of cartoonists presented, the writing contributors of this large volume have concentrated more on issues as defined by comics, the effect of comics on the reading American public, the viability of comics as a forum for public statement and parody, and as a means of entertainment.  While many of the artists' names will not be familiar (Chris Ware, Winsor McCay, Lyonel Feininger, EC Segar, Chester Gould, Charles Schultz, Will Eisner, Harvey Kurtzman, Ari Spiegelman, Gary Painter, George Herriman, Jack Kirby and R. Crumb) certainly their comic strips, comic books,  and individual drawings will strike chords of acknowledgement with the public.  And the proliferation of comic book character driven films has already paved the way for the public's interest in a comics survey.The many contributed essays are variable, from entertaining to illuminating, and are from a well-chosen and curious band of writers: Jonathan Safran Foer, Raymond Pettibon , Tom De Haven, Pete Hamill, Cynthia Burlingham, Jules Feiffer, Glen David Gold, Matt Groening, Staley Crouch, Karla An Manning, Robert Storr, and Dave Eggers.  If at times the essays become dry and didactic, veering from the content of the form, each still adds important information about the various artists and the history of comics. Though some artists, such as Raymond Pettibon and Mike Kelley, have always made art in the form of comic strips thereby setting a precedent for the museum presentation of this medium, it still remains to be seen how the size inherent in comic strips will look on the walls of a vast museum.  Some fear the space will not add to the power of the works, that they are better viewed in the context of this book.  But  given the creativity of MASTERS OF AMERICAN COMICS  it is probable that Curator John Carlin and his associates have overcome this potential visual presentational boredom.  But even if the exhibition is not wholly successful in format, this book/catalogue certainly is!  Grady Harp, November 05 ",1

"This is an Onyx 2005 reprint of a 1985 novel.  It is a little on the dark side, and a change of pace from the author's early novels in the Jury/Plant series.  No side excursions into Long Piddleton, or side issues about flashers.  Perhaps the author was developing a more serious side.  You do need to read some of the earlier novels to understand the Jury and Plant characters.The story starts with a prelude about a murder where the wrong man is convicted.  The only witness, the victim's 5-year old daughter, is left catatonic and unable to point out the killer.  The wrong man is convicted of the crime and sent off to prison, simply because he was infatuated with the victim.Now it is 20 years later.  A serial killer is murdering children in the same geographic area as the earlier murder.  It appears to be the work of a psychopath.  The police are attempting to link the killings and various suspects show up on the scene - the man, just released from prison, who was convicted of the earlier murder; an agoraphobic photographer who seems a bit mysterious; and various relatives who might inherit money if Lady Jessica, a 10-year old heiress, should happen to die.  Events and police work bring the story to some surprising conclusions.  The novel is split into 28 chapters",1

It serves as a wonderful resource for family members, professional staff, and seniors.  I HIGHLY recommend this book",1
"The marketplace is full of purported gurus who can beat the market, and full of players who would love to know how to beat the system. In this volume William Sherden does an absolutely glorious job of debunking the trend-meisters (in weather, in population forecasting and in the sharemarket) to show us why prediction is a harder business than many of us might guess.Peppered with supporting evidence, he shows how ""fools forecasting"" (tomorrow's weather will be the same as today's) has a stronger track record than the scientific weather forecasts we see each night on television. In population forecasting the standard technique of subtracting deaths from births (and adding in migration) is shown to be wonderfully accurate until...until turning points that nobody can forecast. The baby boom after WW2 was expected to last 2 years. It lasted more than a decade.When it comes to market prediction, Sherden palpably opens up his engines of argument: full throttle. He carefully dissects various marketing picking models and shows that their successes are generally outweighed by their failures. This makes strangely entertaining but high salutary reading. The warning to readers: don't get carried away by any system - in a complex world the rules change faster than any of us learn to play the game.Two books that would go nicely with this volume is Ellis' recently published: ""Ahead of the Curve"" (a market forecasting system that looks more solidly founded than others) as well as ""Six Degrees"" by Duncan Watts, a book that explores the volatility and randomness of the world around us.I loved ""Fortune Sellers"": I loved the case studies and I enjoyed Sherden's well-researched, clear writing. He makes technical aspects of his subject very understandable without resorting to over-simplification. Well recommended",1

"The Tyndale New Testament Commentaries are an excellent study reference  for beginning students, experienced pastors and just about anyone else who  wishes to study the New Testament.  This set offers excellent introductions  to all the New Testament books giving several different scholarly views.   The great thing about the set is how flexible the usage is for the set.  Each of the scholars who contributed to the text give in-depth material  which is useful for the highest of scholars, but said in such a way that  you don't have to have a PhD to understand it.  Most of the writers bring  to life the Greek language it was written in without the reader having to  know Greek.  It is an excellent first set of commentaries for the young  Bible student or minister, and it will remain a good source of study even  for an experienced pastor.  I regular use mine, and I am thankful my  parents bought them for me.  Another great thing is that they are  exceptionally cheaper than other sets, because they are paperback.  Great  commentaries and low prices are hard things to beat",1

"The author who dared dissect Maya Angelou's poetry--and find it short on literary quality--is teaching us how to analyze text. Francine Prose analysis prose as she takes the reader on the same journey writers must take every day: examine every word, every sentence, and every paragraph. We listen to the music of the writing as it is being composed note by note. Along the way she gives permission to break some rules of writing--but only when the words end up reaching a higher goal of conveying a meaning to that lapse.A wonderful, strong book, that should be the cornerstone of any writer's library, but one that is well-recommended for all lovers of literature.",1
"Catherine Diodati's work is the best that I have read to date regarding the issue of immunization. It is written in a style that is easy to read, with some acidic wit thrown in at just the appropriate place to keep the topic semi-lighthearted. The book is well researched, well referenced, and well documented with just enough politics of health care to help the reader reach the only conclusion that can be reached. BRAVO",1
"i havent read the book, but i have something to say in response to Gregory Nyman. he said, ""Scripture makes it very clear that Christ lived, died on the Cross, shed his blood for the remission of sins, and rose from the dead to justify those who believe in Him, and as a result, receive eternal life. Jesus also said that those who loved Him would follow His commandments, and He cited the two greatest commandments as loving God with all our heart, soul, strength, and mind, and loving our neighbor as ourselves. Nowhere does the Bible teach that it's 'Christ plus the Commandments.' To come to Christ is to follow - Christ plus nothing and Christ minus nothing. He is our all in all. He is the fulfillment of the Law to all those who believe.""I understand his stance on the 10 commandments because i have many friends that think like him. the problem is, people like him dont even believe in the 10 commandments anymore (if you don't, thats fine...but then why believe the bible at all). but for these people, its still a sin to lie, commit adultry, steal, murder, ect., but its not a sin to break the sabbath. following Gods laws based one what you ""feel"" is idiotic. if you follow one, you should follow them all. you can not pick an choose. following God's law isnt legalism. making up your own laws to say how good you are is (i dont think he said that, but thats often an argument people use). the sabbath is in the bible, it was created by God on the first week of creation, and nothing in the bible refutes that. (i have seen the lame attempts by people to try to use the bible to refute the sabbath, and it is....lame)lastly, like he mentioned that God talked about the 2 greatest commandments. he is right, but if you break down the 10 commandments, they all fall into one of those 2 commandments. he isnt somehow changing this laws or standards for us when He mentions this. all he is doing is stating the principles behind the commandments. love God, and love man. God forgives and GOd is great, but he does have standards, and its dangerous to ignore them. im not a perfect person, but the logic presented by that reader is fallacious",1
"Who are the most relevant actors in international relations? The answer is states for both neorealists and neoliberals though the latter also consider some non-governmental organizations and multinational corporations (MNC) as remarkable units in international politics. Constructivists, on the other hand, pay considerable attention to non-state actors while they also keep states as central actors. Margaret E. Keck and, Kathryn Sikkink present us a well-designed discussion about the significance of non-state actors of world politics in Activist Beyond Borders. First of all, they classify transnational actors into three groups; MNC and international banks that have instrumental goals, epistemic communities that insist on causal ideas and transnational advocacy networks (TAN) that carry principal ideas.Then, they analyze the significance of TAN in international politics by searching for how do TAN work and how do they change conceptions of national interest and principles of policies organizations? Keck and Sikkink mention four fundamental strategies of TAN; information politics, symbolic politics, leverage politics, and accountability politics. They generate information, use symbolic elements, put pressure on states and international organizations, and follow their accountability to international norms. Their effectiveness, however, depend on the issue and actor characteristics that they are targeting. What they do? They cause to reformulation of national interests and they eventually change behavior of states. The principled ideas are the key for TAN and they also lead ideas to transformation of states interests and policies. Activist Beyond Borders has three case studies in the area of TAN; human rights, environment, and violence against women. In these cases, transnational human rights advocacy networks changed authoritarian Latin American governments' notions and policies of human rights. TAN in environment shifted the World Bank's funding policies in corresponding to the protection of environment. TAN in women's rights lead to change state policies in two areas. One of the most significant arguments for IR theory that Keck and Sikkink state is that TAN lead to changes in state understandings of sovereignty. Then states begin to accommodate to re-conceptualized sovereignty at the expense of realist notion of absolute sovereignty. In this sense, they question the realist premises of state interests. They also emphasizes that TAN are important source of new ideas, norms and identities that make repercussions over behavior of states and international organizations. They carry transformative and mobilizing ideas into international system and finally shape fundamentally policies of both state and non-sate actors in world politics. In addition, the authors stress upon the importance of domestic actors for TAN to be successful. Overall, Activists Beyond Borders asserts that TAN endeavor to transform the terms and nature of the debate on fundamentals of international politics",1

"After seeing ""The Queen"" in theatres and being completely blown away by Helen Mirren's acting ability, I purchased the Elizabeth I DVD without having seen it, and I have to say that I have rarely been so impressed with any miniseries (or movie, or television show for that matter) and that is entirely due to Helen Mirren. This is a beautiful story, extremely well written and directed, and spectacularly acted. As Queen Elizabeth I, the notoriously hot-tempered, passionate, and arrogant woman who ruled England for 45 years, Helen Mirren makes us laugh with her, cry with her, and cower when she is provoked or challenged by someone questioning her authority. According to historical experts on Elizabeth I, this movie, and Helen's performance, come closer to getting at what the Queen was really like as a person than any other film has ever done.Jeremy Irons and Hugh Dancy are wonderful as well, and Irons in particular, as the sardonic, protective, and smitten Earl of Leicester, the Queen's best friend and only true love. Though he cannot marry her, he stands by her side and (with one notable exception), is entirely honest with her, even when telling the truth is sure to provoke one of the Queen's blind rages. There is one slight liberty taken with the plot; it is true (and acknowledged by Helen and the writers in the special features on the DVD, as well as in interviews) that Queen Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots never met, and that if they had it would have been done in absolute secrecy; the movie shows them meeting but it is done in secret, so I was able to overlook the fact that in truth, that meeting did not take place.Seriously, if you like period pieces and you want to see great writing, direction, costumes, and spectacular acting, see this version of Elizabeth I. Helen Mirren alone makes it worth watching, and everyone else in it it fabulous too",0

"The film tries to bring together four different types of refugees. Southern Italians who migrated to Northern Italy and became mussolinians. Russian female dancers who fled away from the Bolshevik revolution and are ready to use their bodies to get acquainted with rich people, no matter what. Russian Jews, representing all Jews, running away from persecution, Russian or German, communist or nazi. Gypsies who are at home nowhere and are always shuddering in front of some danger but always fighting with their one and only family, for their one and only family, for survival. And the film covers about 15 years of European history starting in 1927. It is a very sad film with negative events and persecution adding up, year after year to a total deculturization that is imposed onto all those who do not fit - the very word used by the Welsh teacher who will teach Fegele-Suzy how to sing and who was punished for speaking Welsh in school - in the normalized society in which they live. And yet, deep in the deepest depth of one's soul there is an island or a cavern where one is what one has always been and will always be. It is called resilience and the film is a marvelous example of such resilience. One can always survive in one's mind if one believes in the power of human memory: never forget the past, just cultivate it in your mind's eye and it will come back one day. The film is also a powerful lesson of love. Love is the power to convince the one you love to run away from danger and live, though you have to stay behind and fight. And the man who loves Fegele-Suzy that much can cry all night when she sleeps in their last night together and pretend he is asleep when she is ready to go. And yet the film never gets sentimentalese. It remains extremely pure, perfect and does not waste time and energy on self-pity or pathetic schmaltzy compassion.

"David Deida helps fill in the gap that is lacking in American society today. Here, he helps the confused, feminized man understand what being a true man is all about, and what women really want and need in a relationship. On top of this, he helps raise awareness of what men really want and need in a relationship! Seems like it would be obvious, but as much as men think they know what they want, they are as typically confused about their own desires as they are about the desires of women! This book really clears a lot up - and presents a new perspective that makeslife more interesting at the same time",1

Tight, with amazing time changes & incredible hooks, this one wins over everyone who hears it.Jan Hammer is backed by Jerry Goodman on violin (with whom he did the album ""Like Children"" earlier), and had worked with during his stint with The Mahavishnu Orchestra. Also on board are Fernando Saunders on bass, and Tony Smith on drums, who are currently working with Lou Reed (!). A precurser to Hammer's work on ""Miami Vice"", this proves that he was no one-hit (or one soundtrack) wonder.If you are a fan of electronic keyboards, The Mahavishnu Orchestra, or in-your-face beats, this is a must-have",0

"This is a great compilation album! It starts off with a remix of &quot;I Will Survive&quot; by Gloria Gaynor. I prefer the original, found on Pure Disco #1. The second track is the KC and the Sunshine Band Hit, &quot;Shake Your Booty&quot;, which I doubt anyone doesn't know at least one line of. Then is one of my favorite disco songs, Vicki Sue Robinson's &quot;Turn the Beat Around&quot;. It is a song with so much going on you almost get lost! After that is &quot;Macho Man&quot; by the Village People, which is definitely not one of my favorites, but some people like it. Next is Sister Sledge's &quot;We Are Family&quot;, which is just a bit repetitious. After that is the famous &quot;What a Feeling&quot; by Irene Cara. It may not technically be disco, but it's a nice inclusion. Next is Andy Gibb's &quot;I Just Want to Be Your Everything&quot;, which I like the beat and melody, but not Andy Gibb's vocals. After that is &quot;Everlasting Love&quot; by Carl Carlton, a quite unappreciated song. Then you'll hear &quot;Can't Get Enough of Your Love&quot;, a Barry White song I'm not too fond of. After that is The Hues Corporation's &quot;Rock the Boat&quot;, which annoys me for some crazy reason. Then you'll get &quot;Love Rollercoaster&quot; by the Ohio players, the most annoying disco song of all time. The only songs after that worth mentioning are &quot;Upside Down&quot;, a fun song by the Motown/Disco legend Diana Ross. &quot;Gimme Gimme Gimme&quot;, one of my favorite ABBA songs, &quot;It's Raining Men&quot;, a song with about 3 other versions floating around, and &quot;Last Dance&quot;, the most energetic disco song I've heard. The best songs on here are &quot;Last Dance&quot;, &quot;Turn the Beat Around&quot;, and &quot;What a Feeling&quot;. I reccomend this to any disco fans",0

"Ever since the beginning of 2006(which wasn't really that long ago) The Distillers have been my favorite band. I am really glad I bought 2002's Sing Sing Death House first. This is pretty much the album that not only made me a Distillers fan, but a punk fan. I didn't get into real punk rock until I got this CD. What an album to start my listening!I guess I should probably point out this band's(well this lineup of the band) talent: Brody is an amazing singer. Alot better than other ""punk"" singers like jorge of the casualties and other cookie monster screaming fools. Yeah Brody screams alot, but at least it doesn't sound unintelligentable, at least not as much as other screamers. Casper is good for a punk guitarist. She's always thinking of cool instrumentals.I really like Ryan Sinn's bass work. It's ALOT better than his not even noticeable bass in angels and airwaves.LAst, but deffidently not least, Andy Outbreack. One of the best punk drummers ever. He was without a doubt the best drummer the band ever had.I guess I'll review the tracks now.1.Sick Of It All5/5 They could not have picked a better song to open the album with. It goes from fast to slow to fast again perfectly.2.I Am A Revenant5/5 This is probably my favorite song on the album and may in fact be my favorite song of all time. It's dark, fast, and just overflows with perfect-ness (I know, dumb phrase lol). I love the lyrics, hell I love everything about this song.3.Seneca Falls5/5 This was actually my favorite for a little while. It's lighter and a bit happier than the previous tracks. Overall it's another great song.4.The Young Crazed Peeling4.5/5 This song was picked as the first single. Not quite as good as the previous tracks, but it's also really good.5.Sing Sing Death House5/5 This song is extremely angry. Sometimes I feel like a death house too...6.Bullet & The Bullseye4.5/5 Really short and to the point song.7.City Of Angels4/5 Probably the only song on the album that I can call overrated(since the album as a whole is pretty underrated). It's still good, don't get me wrong.8.Young Girl5/5 Really great one. It starts like a balled type song, then goes into a cool punk rocker. The message is a bit serious though.9.Hate Me5/5 It's be a crime to not like this song! hahaAnyway, this is a REALLY great song. Brody's screaming from the ceiling of her lungs. I wonder how she can do it.10.Desperate4.5/5 Good one. It's lowered half a star since the ""1234 this is a war"" thing gets a bit annoying.11.I Understand4.5/5 Another cool song. The subject matter gives it a half star.12.Lordy Lordy5/5 Perfect track to finish this amazing album. It sounds a bit country at times. haha but it's still awesome.Well I hope this review is helpful. If you think modern punk sucks(which most of it does) pick this up, and you'll find a sanctuary",0
"Im Not So Tough is a wonderful album. Even though the image wasn't what Mindy wanted, all BNA's doing, which lead to their breakup, the song selection here is very good for Mindy and her voice. The album was very poorly promoted, with only one single released (not even a video), so fans felt like Mindy was not getting the attention she deserved. Each song on here is a gem, like the title track Im Not So Tough (single worthy), Thunder And Roses, the first single (and only single) All I Want Is Everything. Two Different Things is a nice song, could of been a single. Tumble and Roll is another great song which has a nice hook. However I believe the stand out on the album is one of Mindy's best songs ever, a beautiful ballad titled Over And Over. Lucky Me and Take Me Apart are fun sassy songs you could come to expect from Mindy. Overall this whole album is just fun to listen and sing along with, its a shame Mindy gets such a bad rap and her music doesn't get promoted, because she has so much talent. Maybe now that she is with Capitol Nashville, her next album Scream to be released in March 2001, will do much much better and she will get the attention she deserves",0

"This album is musical, not weird like so many cuts on so many of his albums. If you like hard core jazz with unexpected changes that appeal to some, then don't buy this. But if you like songs that have some of the best melodies and palatable chord progressions there are, this album is unbeatable, in my opinion. His album Still Life is almost as good as this too, fyi. His other albums have too many weird songs mixed in on them. But when this guy wants to write a melody, he is unbeatable, and that's what he does here. I have listened to this CD back to back for weeks if not months at a time, with no other CDs in between times, believe it or not",0
"LaVey was a truly fascinating person. Though one should take much of this book with a grain of salt, it does provide a good deal of information and was very fun to read.

"I never gave this album much of a chance when it first came out. Maybe I thought it was a little to laid back at the time. After buying this 461 Ocean Blvd. [Deluxe Edition] disc I now feel it is one of Clapton's finest efforts and one of the finest albums of the 70's. When you add the many bonus tracks it is an irresistible must have. That said I will let other reviewers deal with the artistic content of this disc. I am cursed with an obsession for the quality of the recording and digital transfer. In other words how it sounds on expensive esoteric stereo equipment. This year I have been bitten by the SACD bug yet every time I play this CD I am shocked at how amazingly great it sounds. I do not understand how but this disc matches my SACD's when it comes to natural, warm, detailed, and dynamic sound reproduction. When you add the extra bonus disc of great 70's rock how can one resist. ""JUST BUY IT"" and thank me later.  ",0

"This is an excellent analysis of the current state of affairs in higher education.  The book includes 14 chapters including the conclusion.  Each chapter can be read independently, as they follow the famed Harvard case study method.  Each chapter describes a unique issue impacting higher education.  Some of these interesting issues include: a) the advent and so far failing of online higher education; b) the success of for profit publicly traded university companies; c) the new sources of funds for universities, including copyrights and patents; d) the ongoing restructuring of undergraduate core curriculum to please the students and private industry; e) the shrinking government subsidization of public universities and their resulting de facto privatization; f) the compromising of the independence of university research when financed by the private sector; and f) various attempts to revive the liberal arts discipline within an increasingly profit driven higher education culture.  Throughout these issues, the authors covers recurring themes.  These include the many conflict of interest between: a) intellectual culture and profits; b) professors' research activities and undergraduate teaching; c) practical job oriented education and liberal arts.  Some of these fascinating themes beg the questions of what is knowledge? What is culture? Even what is critical thinking?  During the Renaissance the answer to such questions would include being fluent in both Latin and Greek in addition to a couple of vernacular languages.  It also entailed having an extremely developed art appreciation supported by demonstrated artistic capabilities.  A broad and deep understanding of most aspects of science was also important.  Thus, in comparison to this ideal Renaissance Mind model, we are really all a bunch of illiterates no matter how well educated we are. The author finishes the book by asking what will be the Latin and Greek disciplines of tomorrow.  What he means by that is what will be the dying intellectual disciplines that will not survive our practical and profit driven culture.  He ventures to offer some candidates for the intellectual cemetery, including: English literature, pure mathematics, foreign languages, maybe sociology and other liberal arts disciplines.  He mentions these with much sadness.  He does not want it to happen.  But, he suggests that the painting may be on the wall.The bright side of the coin is that higher education has never been so alive.  Universities attempt a cocktail of different strategies to survive and thrive.  Also, a bunch of smart institutions are attacking the higher education monopoly from all sides.  Students of all ages never had so many opportunities to acquire higher learning in so many different ways.  None of us does speak Latin and Greek anymore.  But, we all have infinite opportunities to keep on learning throughout our lives be it a certification in C++ programming, or a business or law degree from specialized institutions.  Also, online education is bound to make a come back and compound learning opportunities for all of us.  What's wrong with all that?  Not much really.

"A story of unbounded love that sweeps from the snowy Scottish highlands to the exotic pleasure-domes of Constantinople to sultry intrigue-ridden Naples...the tale of Catriona, Countess of Glenkirk and Francis, Earl of Bothwell is one of the great romances of all time. Bothwell, who defied the wrath of his King to possess the woman he loved, and Catriona, mistress to the King, wife to a Count, and lover to the most courageous, tender Lord in all Scotland...2 people who want only each other, and because it can never be, set the world afire with Love Wild and Fair. Bertrice Small is my favorite author. I have been reading her novels since I was 15 years old. This is one of her best. Based on a real herorine, Catriona Hay is an amazing woman with cunning and quick wits to help her finally achieve what her heart wants most-Francis Bothwell",1

"Judaism, Physics And God: Searching For Sacred Metaphors In A Post-Ein-stein World strives to answer the question, ""If we can't see it or prove it, how can we believe it?"" Leading the reader on a journey through both the ideas of modern physics and the ancient teachings of rabbinic text, Judaism, Physics and God stresses that faith and scientific insight do not need to be mutually exclusive. Chapters explore cosmology and creation, quantum mechanics, Albert Enstein's theories of special relativity, general relativity and Jewish meaning, string theory, and integrating new metaphors and scientific awareness into traditional Jewish life. As meticulous in its research of sacred Judaic texts and philosophy as it is of modern physics, yet presented to be as accessible as possible to the lay reader striving to better understand complex concepts, Judaism, Physics And God is a welcome addition to religious debate and studies shelves. Highly recommended.",1
THE MAKING OF THE FITTEST: DNA AND THE ULTIMATE FORENSIC RECORD OF EVOLUTION explores a different dimension of DNA: as a record of how species adapt and change. Both public libraries strong in scientific investigation and adventure and high school to college-level holdings on genetics will find here a lively survey of the discovery of fossil genes and DNA 'prints' which carry on from bacteria to whales. Sean B. Carroll is a professor of genetics and his DNA survey will enlighten and excite a wide audience,1

The tragedy for our truly great popular recording ARTISTS has been the steadfast refusal of the pop audience to accept their musical growth as it occurs. The fact that most people do not evolve at the same pace as these artists is no reason to denegrate their works. For the reviewer from Hong Kong I respectfully suggest that his mark is more a reflection of his own musical limitations and not those of this  amazingly agile singer,0
"This movie is definately a thinking person's movie.  The action is in the thoughts it provokes and trying to figure out whose side the characters are really on.  If you like this sort of movie, I highly recommend this.  If you want action or a movie that simply entertains you, pass on it",0
Though the mini telenovela is based on the life of Zapata the best part about it is of course the super acting of Lorena Rojas. One of the most talanted figures of spanish speaking tv. The story is well developed and the love story between Rojas and Damian Bichir is the best part of it. The life of Zapata is shown through the eyes of the creators and not the historic version of it,0
"I'm a huge fan of alex flinn's books, and this one def. does not disappoint.  It's a little different from her other books because its in 3 viewpoints about the same thing.  I really liked how Daria's sections were told in poetry showing how she thinks.  If you read the review below, I'd be really curious how carefully this person read the book because he/she says she was waiting for 2 characters to get together and talk and they didn't, but I can't imagine which characters this person means.  The whole book, I was waiting for Alex and Clinton to talk and when they did it was really great.  There was also a really good ending with Alex and Jennifer.  In the whole it was a really good and satisfying book.  Definitely recommend",1
"As I prepared to visit Zambia to learn how communities are coping with the HIV/AIDS pandemic, I tried to help the children of our church understand what life is like in Africa. ""You mean they are so poor nobody buys them toys?"" Galimoto not only gives a realistic picture of life in a small African village, it celebrates the resourceful spirit of African children. Our young people were filled with wonder when I brought home a galimoto that I bought on a roadside in Zambia. They were eager to try their hand at creating their own galimotos",1

"We are compelled to ... copy and paste almost the whole another's reader review, where I found almost all what we are not only thinking but directly first hand KNOWING, not only as ""firm believer"" rather as working to ""collect proofs"" and helping direct victims on this field.""To convince me of their point of view by eliciting emotion rather than reason..."": how much I think this to be a mighty favour for changing real facts to mere lined up suggestions. ""I tend to regard every word that follows with considerable suspicion. I'm querky that way, having learned long ago that emotion is the fastest way to short circuit reason."": thanks Cathy (Oregon, USA) for your words!""Agenda?, October 17, 2001Reviewer:	Cathy (Oregon, USA) - See all my reviews...Hey, I'm a firm believer that the U.S. government lies and performs harmful experiments on it's citizens on a regular basis. We have proof of that, lots of it. That said, when some one attempts to convince me of their point of view by eliciting emotion rather than reason, as Mr. Keith does, I tend to regard every word that follows with considerable suspicion. I'm querky that way, having learned long ago that emotion is the fastest way to short circuit reason.Mr. Keith buries us in references and offical sounding partial quotes from important people and important sounding people hoping that we the reader won't notice the constant use of buz words meant to elicit emotion rather than reason. ""The Elite"", ""greed"", ""world wide conspiracy"", the ""ruling class"", ""eminent stuffed shirts"". On and on, over and over, emotional buz words meant to illicit the we vs them response, where ""we"", the reader, are good and ""they"" are evil. Again, in order to elicit the ""oh, my god"" from us, he uses phrases such as ""may have been a member of"", without ever offering any proof of actual membership in this awful organization or ""it has been reported"", but he never tells us who reported these awful things.This book was especially dissapointing for me, because for the most part I agree with the idea that there are ""beings"" trying to control our thought. As if our ""free press"" doesn't do a superb job already. I admit that I finally gave up on this book some where around chapter 10. I'd just had it. I suspect that there are truths to be found here, but I was unable to get past Mr. Keith's style to find any. Maybe you can get past this, obviously from some of the previous reviews, some readers don't even notice it. Me, I'm the suspicious type and this book caused me to think that maybe there is LESS, not MORE with respect to the idea of mind control.",1
"One thing must be made clear: ""Memories ..."" is not cookbook. Yes, the authors, who happen to be the proprietors of Cendrillon in New York, provide good recipes for many of the important Filipino dishes. But the book is much more a scholarly anthropology of what is perhaps the least understood of Asia's great cuisines. It tells you which dishes are truly indigenous, which ones are borrowed and adapted from Spain and Mexico and which ones are from Asian neighbors. The authors also tell you about wonderful personalities in the Philippines who produce dishes to die for. There is the master lechonero of Silay and the famous puto maker of Pila. There is even a bit of adventure -- they take you along in the hunt for the very elusive Kurakding, more rare and better tasting apparently than the white truffle of Piedmont! A fun book for intelligent foodies",1
"I can not imagine a more perfectly written story combining these two essential icons.  The story is so intriguing and spell-binding.  And then the art... Batman is so intimidating.

"Unsung Hero was the first one of the series that i had picked up(fortunately this one was the first one of the series), And it hooked me to the whole series. I have already read most of the series. recently i picked this one up again just because i had enjoyed it so much the first time and i just had that great time once again!Tom and Kelly's story is so HOT! Both of them are so different on the surface but Kelly is not such a nice girl as she looks and Tom is not nearly as bad a boy that whole town seems to think he is. Kelly is wild and Tom is a sensitive guy. I really loved how Kelly finally got Tom in her bed. I mean it was kind of thrilling how she completely lost her patience with Tom being 'Nice' to her for her own good because she wanted the Tom she had known when she was fifteen who was dangerous and she wanted him badly! But later when she treated him badly i really felt like crying for Tom. Tom pretended to be a tough guy but he was very sensitive and i kind of felt good when he made Kelly crawl for sayings those things to him.David and Mallory's story was good too. I think in this book most of the characters were completely oppostite to what they looked like when u got to know them better. Like Tom and Kelly and then David and Mallory. David looked like a geek and a loser but he was smart and talented and Mallory looked like a bold 'devil may care' attitude girl but inside she was very vulnerable and unsure about herself. I liked this journey to get to know these characters. The World War II love triangle was the best story of this series i have read till now. Charles, Joe and Cybele's story was really intense and tragic. And the end was awesome. Finally Charles became the hero Cyeble fell in love with",1

"I admit, I'm a book snob. I like classic, respectable works of literature. You know, the ones that English teachers ramble on and on about. I've outgrown my romance-devouring days (Or so I claim.)This book. This book is my guilty pleasure. It's not fine literature,(Although *is* it well written) It's got a fair share of smut, can be melodramatic at times, and the story stretches the limits of believability at times. But it's still so good. I couldn't put it down. I couldn't help but laugh out loud, yell when someone does something unbelievably stupid, or cry at the gut wrenching parts.So as long as you aren't expecting Wuthering Heights (Which I STRONGLY reccomend, even for people who hate classics) then this book won't dissapoint.",1
"For someone like myself, who enjoys a really exciting story, preferably about a real person,one need go no further than to read ""A Hero of Our Own"" by Sheila Isenberg. Varian Frye, a not-so-ordinary American, feels impelled to leave his comfortable life as a writer and editor and go to France as a member of the Emergency Rescue Committe (ERC) and risk his life to save as many refugees (mostly Jews) as he can from the Nazis. Frye is the only American  to be honored at Yad Vashem (Israel's Holocaust Memorial) because of his work in saving thousands of Jews. If I didn't know it was a true story, I'd think it was fiction because his adventures read like a fast-paced thriller, a veritable realization of the classic ""film noir"" of the forties. In fact, I feelthe book cries out to be made into a movie which I would be happy to see. Of course some of the book's revealed facts about our own State Department trying to keep refugee Jews from entering the United States when they knew it mean certain death was quite shocking and disturbing.  However, all in all, I'd recommend the book to anyone who enjoys reading a fast-paced  book about real heros and history",1
". . . but I finally did.  This disc demands close listening.  Its nuanced pleasures, from Fort's gently slurred piano notes and brilliant pedal deployment, to Ed Schuller's deep, woody bass played with precisely bent notes and sly overtones, to Paul Motian's magical, dancing cymbals and sprung time, reveal themselves only to those who pay attention.  Casual listening makes it almost sound--heaven forbid--mundane.Only after easing into its subtle sensibilities do the furtive melodies began to reveal their hidden beauty and rigor.  And just when one gets used to the finely tuned piano-trio concept, enter Perry Robinson, who has a unique approach and beguiling tone on clarinet, to lift the session to new heights.  What seemed an entirely lovely outing suddenly turns mysterious, and sometimes even scary, starting with the very Charlie Haden-ish ""Lullaby,"" continuing with the spooky ""Chapter Two,"" a Fort/Robinson duet, and resurfacing whenever Robinson joins the proceedings (""Not a Dream?"" with its magical-realist soundscape, ""As Two/Something 'Bout Camels,"" certainly the most ambitious number on the disc, drenched in longing until, about midway through, a huge angst surfaces with Robinson's skittish clarinet and Schuller's brave bass solo, soon resolving into a more familiar-yet-still-alien territory, Robinson playing obsessive ocarina over delicate piano chords, and, finally, ""Just Now, Var. III,"" with such palpable Sehnsuct that the listener almost keels over from longing).Two solo piano numbers underscore Fort's understated genius, ""Just Now, Var. II,"" with its delicate wistfulness, and ""Chapter One,"" a study in quiet virtuosity, full of spiky melodies and faux-Romantic yearnings, all dolled up in gloriously ruminative wrappings.As I say, you might be fooled by the apparent ease of execution that permeates this remarkable disc.  But take the time to listen closely, and I think you'll agree that only a musician of the highest accomplishment could conceive and imbue such seeming ordinary music with such magic.Highest recommendation",0
"If you've been looking for a series that combines the magic of Harry Potter with the imaginative characters of Artemis Fowl, then Septimus Heap and his first book, MAGYK, is definitely the story for you.  A quick, delightful read that can stand on its own, MAGYK is, without a doubt, an intriguing page-turner.Septimus Heap, the seventh son of a seventh son, died shortly after birth.  Born to a family of Wizards, there's no telling what he might have become, as his lineage as a seventh son would have made him unbelievably magical.  But on that winter night when Septimus died, his father, Silas, found another newborn child in the forest.  They named her Jenna, and she grew up thinking that she was the daughter of Silas and Sarah Heap, and the sister of six older brothers--Simon, Sam, Edd, Erik, Nicko, and Jo-Jo.  Early on, though, Sarah had her own ideas of who Jenna really was, especially when she heard the news that the Queen had been murdered.  Jenna Heap was, undoubtedly, the Princess.Over the next ten years, darkness came to the Castle and the Ramblings, where the Heaps lived.  With no Queen, evil came in the form of the Supreme Custodian, who along with his cohorts banned magic and ended the happiness the Queen's people had once known.  As the Heap family attempt to ride out this time of darkness, the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, Marcia Overstrand, learns of the plot to kill the Princess, which will allow evil to truly take over the Palace.  It seems that the only thing keeping DomDaniel, the Dark Wizard, from returning to the Castle is the presence of the Princess, and he plans to remedy that.What follows is the flight of Jenna, Nicko, the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, and a Young Army recruit known only as Boy 412 to the Marram Marshes, where Aunt Zelda Heap, a White Witch, will be able to keep them from harm.  As events unfold and DomDaniel does everything within his power to track down the girl standing between him and a ruling darkness, the Heap family will have to do everything within their means to stop him--and at the same time stay alive.MAGYK is a delightful, entertaining story filled with action-adventure and fantasy.  With a very large cast of characters who are as diverse as they come, this is one story not to be missed.  If you like Harry Potter, you will definitely enjoy Septimus Heap.  Filled with twists and turns, this is a story you'll stay up reading long into the night.  And although at times predictable, you'll quickly be drawn into the life and times of the Heap family and their magical world.",1

"this beautifully designed deluxe 2cd set fully captures the spirit of the great Roky Erikson; a loveable and hugely influential singer/songwriter whose tunes don't just  stradle the line between garage rock, folk, and psychadelic blues rock, they break down those lines to create a wholly pure and unique sound.beginning with the first single w/ his first band, The Spades, ""We Sell Soul"" revels in it's own primitive simplicity and has such a spark burning under it's surface that the listener can't help but stay tuned in. every music fan with the slightest interest in garage rock or psychadelic music knows of the legendary 13th Floor Elevators and ten tracks from that band are represented here with my personal favorites being furious storm of ""You're Gonna Miss Me,"" the controlled groove of ""Slip Inside This House,"" and the heartwarming folk of ""I Had To Tell You.""i think it's fairly safe to assume that most of the casual fans have failed to explore Roky's solo efforts and other bands that he was a part of after the demise of The 13th Floor Elevators. confusingly monikered bands like Roky Erikson & Bleib Alien, and Roky Erikson & Evil Hook Wildlife E.T. all share the same adventerous spirit of Roky's 60's glory days, but these later recordings reveal much more darkness and a fascination with occult magick and various monsters and demons.for example, the spooky rock and roll of ""I Think Up Demons"" where amidst whirling reverb and a fiery guitar line, Roky lists different demonic figure's characteristics that he has created...almost like gifts for friends. the melody is so strong and solid that it actually doesn't seem like an unusual lyrical idea. mostly due to the fact, that Roky makes us feel comfortable in his strange and eccentric world. things eventually drop into bad B-movie territory; as on ""Creature With The Atop Brain"" which utilizes a dialogue of a news report warning viewers to be on the lookout. it could come accross as terribly hokey to some listeners, but i find it part of the Erikson charm and it makes me crack a smile.with all the goofy creatures running around in Roky's brain (or his recording studio), there's still plenty of time for a love song and ""Starry Eyes"" is a stunningly beautiful one in particular. drifting along the lines of a country rock song, it's simple lyrics and beautifully catchy melody get stuck in my head for days and it quickly became not just one of my favorite Roky Erikson songs; but one of my favorite songs of all time!a few more quick favorites: the blues rock blast of ""The Beast,"" the creepy and intense stomp of ""Bloody Hammer,"" the jagged (almost post-punk) rythyms of ""Click Your Fingers Applauding The Play,"" and the heartbreaking tender touch of ""You Don't Love Me Yet"" and ""Nothing In Return."" wow. i could literally go on forever about every song on this compilation.the songs on I Have Always Been Here Before display such a huge talent and an even larger amount of heart; it's sad to think that one day Roky Erikson will not be with us any more...and he's right...we are gonna miss him",0

"This book is worth its weight in gold! There are activities, games, ideas, etc. suitable for any occasion. I have a son and a daughter, am a boy scout and a girl scout leader, entertain numerous neighborhood children and bring crafts into my children's classrooms often.

Even if I don't follow an idea exactly, I receive inspiration for other activities/crafts and always find a use for any type of container, paper roll, rocks, pinecones, etc.  So if you want a book that not only has great craft ideas but also ideas for groups, games, things to keep your kids entertained while they're waiting for dinner; then this is your book!   Have fun and enjoy",1
A paradigm shattering eye opener for the scientist and layman alike. The author goes to great lengths to be fair in his analysis of the politics afoot in the world of scientific academia.

In a word the book is simply astonishing,1

Moreover, he does this in the context of a flowing narrative that drops  some stories here and picks them up there, juggles one aspect with another;  sets them aside, traces another development . . . without ever losing the  flow, without ever losing the reader.        I've read a lot of film books,  and the skill and the intelligence of this one just amazed me.  This is a  dazzling piece of work, and it reads like a really good novel.

If that's the only thing you want, the Vault Buzz Book may be better for you, but if you want that info along with a guide of what to do with that information, this is perfect. ",1
"     There is so much anti-American sentiment worldwide that one is not surprised to find that these strident deniers of all worthwhile things traditionally American are often of the homegrown variety.  In WHY THE LEFT HATES AMERICA, Daniel J. Flynn takes the Left to task as he analyzes who they are, why they think the way they do, and what the Right can say to refute the Left's most egregious charges.  Flynn places current vitriolic hatred of America within an historical context.  He notes that those who shout the loudest are often the same ones who in the mid 1960s stormed the ivy citadels of Columbia University in their protest against the Vietnam War.  Those bearded radicals upset far more than the placid decorum of a few harried college administrators.  Over the next few decades they became the new generation of administrators and teachers.  They wrote books revamping history, taught a brand of history that focused only on America's acknowledged blighted past and carefully overlooked an unacknowledged glory filled record of achievement.  Flynn notes that the trend toward anti-American thought began with the early Communist converts of this country in the mid 1920s. It was not difficult for these converts to attract the leaders of a series of oppressed minorities to their cause: W. E. B.  DuBois, Paul Robeson, and Lincoln Steffens. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the race toward finishing the job begun by DuBois, Robeson, and Steffens accelerated.  I seem to recall that it was only then that I began to read about a new source of blame America first; the Frankfurt School of Max Horkheimer, Erich Fromm, Theodor Adorno, and Georg Lukacs revamped their then debunked Critical Theory to criticize American culture from top to bottom.  Flynn does a thorough job of connecting the ideological dots between the early Communists, the later neo-Communists, and the born again Critical Theorists, all of whom made it clear that in the contest between literal truth and inflexible ideology it must be the latter that had to triumph.  In fact, a central tenet of Flynn's book is that nearly all of those who shout out that the United States is to blame for all of the world's real and imagined ills share the common belief that any rumor or discredited theory that vindicates their core beliefs must be accepted as literal truth, regardless of hard evidence to the contrary.  The reverse is also true; any proven fact that contradicts their core beliefs is either conveniently ignored or-what can only be seen as a colossal gall-that such evidence is admitted to be true but still does not discredit those beliefs.	The most fascinating part of Flynn's book is his chapter on The Five Big Lies:Myth #1: American women live under a patriarchyMyth #2: America is the world's leading threat to the environmentMyth #3: America is a racist nation Myth #4: The United States is an imperial powerMyth #5: The rich get richer, the poor get poorer	Flynn examines each of these in turn since the typical anti-American sentiment most often involves one or more such charges.  Flynn debunks each one not by denying America never suffered from any of them, but by noting that America now looks pretty good in comparison with the rest of the world.  Ultimately, Flynn defends America not by claiming that it is some impossibly perfect utopia, but by pointing out that there must be a reason why so many third world inhabitants suffer greatly to arrive here, rather than indulge in the reverse. For those who wonder why the extreme Left fringe of the Democratic Party truly hates America in general and George Bush in particular, Flynn's book is a good place to begin. ",1
"Mr. Abel was a humanist that traced his lineage of thought from the English pragmatic humanist F.C.S. Schiller to the Greek Sophist Protagoras (420-490 BCE) and beyond. ""Man is the measure of all things: of those that are, that they are; and of those that are not, that they are not."" Protagoras' notion that judgements and knowledge are in some way relative to the individual. This is a line of agnostic thinkers that put man at the center of the stage. They claim no absolute knowledge. This last claim Socrates did one better by not claiming any knowledge at all. Socrates is the first of the great Humanists in the West, and Confucius was the first great Humanist in the East. Humanists are proud to be human beings. Humanists' two fundamental tenets are that a man should learn to think for himself, and values are uniquely human--man is the measure. Though a little too manthropocentric an approach to our specie's place in the Cosmos for my liking Abel nevertheless does manage to make me feel good about being human. I matter. Abel's pride does not seem to me to be the false pride of hubris. Rather he seems a very dignified human being that represents us well. I am sorry ladies, but you will just have to keep being patient with us men. I assure you when Abel says man he means mankind, men and women.  With the above said Abel's ""Man is the Measure"" is a cordial invitation from a humanist perspective addressed to all human beings in regards to the central problems of philosophy. He believes in humanity, in our capacity to grow. The one and the many are invited to join in the philosophical debates. ""Man is the Measure"" is written with a friendly tone and in an elegantly simple manner. It is a very thorough outline of philosophical history, and you may join in if you like. Abel is to be congratulated for his ecumenical approach to truth. This is a very good place for those with a curious mind to begin or continue their examined life. ",1

This one is intended to sit on your shelf and get cracked open when you have a fairly specific question and want a more thorough answer than the typical a quick google will provide.

"The M18 Hellcat was a very important tank destroyer used by the U.S. in WWII.  Even though it was armed with the 76mm gun used by later M4 Sherman tanks, the Hellcat had a new suspension system, high maneuverability, and high road speed, which enabled it to outmaneuver German Panthers and Tigers where it could fire well-placed flanking shots at its targets.  Steven Zaloga does a marvelous job of describing the development and combat performance of the Hellcat. He includes helpful information such as the production numbers and the armor penetration of the 76mm M1A1 gun (compared to the British 17 pounder and the German 75mm gun). What fascinated me the most was Zaloga's detailed description of the combat performance of the M18, especially against German Panthers & Tigers at the battle of Arracourt in mid-September 1944 and the Battle of the Bulge.  Zaloga points out the strengths (its reliability and high maneuverability) and deficiencies of the M18 in combat (e.g. its thin armor, the lack of roof armor, and the lack of co-axial machine gun). He also writes about the performance of the M18 in the Japanese theater of operations and post-WWII service.  The colored illustrations and plates by Jim Laurier are excellent as usual.  If you want a brief but complete treatment of the M18 Hellcat, this is an excellent book to buy. Steven Zaloga is one of my favorite authors on tanks and AFVs. ",1

I was one of the lucky few to have purchased a copy of The Good Fairies of New York before it became an out-of-print statistic. Martin has a talent for twisting the logic out of reality, and making you believe his tales are not mere inventions of his fragmented mind, but instead are actual events. The Good Fairies of New York will make you a believer, if not in fairies, at least in Martin's belief that they exist. The Good Fairies is not a child's fairytale, but instead a tale that includes fairies. Martin's forte is writing about characters that are flawed (some physically flawed, all emotionally flawed). Although Martin brings a refreshing childlike innocence in his approach of character development, his books are very adult orientated. He is not afraid to tackle serious subjects using a perverse sense of humor to lighten the mood when life becomes too grim. The Good Fairies will take you on an emotional ride that you will want to re-experience over and over. All of Martin's books should have the following label ... Caution: be forewarned that all it takes is one book to become a Martin Millar junkie",1
I picked this up based on the comments and the fact it was one of the first books about Flash MX on the market at the time. I was so disappointed with the book. I've been working with FLash for a bit and I was lost with what he was trying to say. Don't believe the hype,1
"One of the unfortunate consequences of Nat ""King"" Cole's exquisite career as a vocalist is that many fans have forgotten--or never knew--what an exceptional Jazz pianist he was. Moreover, Cole influenced pianists as chronologically and geographically divergent as Canadians Oscar Peterson and Diana Krall, and Brazil's Tania Maria. AFTER MIDNIGHT serves up equal doses of Cole's vocals and piano playing. From the lush beauty of ""What Is There To Say"" to the mid-tempo swing of ""When I Grown Too Old To Dream"" to the lightening quick ""I Know That You Know"", Cole confirms his place in both Popular Vocalist history and Jazz Piano history as well.In a recording featuring such luminaries as Harry ""Sweets"" Edison on trumpet, and the often forgotten violinist Stuff Smith, AFTER MIDNIGHT is the perfect offering for any fan of the Nat ""King"" Cole Trio as well as those fans who are more familiar with Cole as a vocalist. A perfect blend is found here",0
"This book was well researched, and provides an entertaining and enlightening insight into an era that could not exist since the civil rights movement of the 60's.   It speaks to social justice and inclusion, bias and the ability to transcend existing norms to earn a living at a time when, for black America, second class citizenship and economic hardship were the norm.  Mr. Watkins is the professor and we are his students",1
"I have to say this was a great show to watch; The intro was a great attention getter.  I mean, if you're an Ike & Tina fan, like I am, then you got to get this video/DVD. Watching Tina & the Ikettes dancing from this 1971 film makes it clear to me where a lot of today's artisit get the desire to dance in front audiences, at least got it indirectly. Hip shaken and everything--did TV even show those kind of moves back then? Well with the exception of James Brown of course. And as most Ike & Tina fans know, there isn't that much legit footage of their performances. So this is worth getting for Ike & Tina viewing only. I was kind of disappointed that Santana wasn't shown much; although their performance of Black Magic Women was great. THe guiter sounds and intensity, it was great. I liked watching the energy of the Voices of East Harlem. I never even heard of them before watching the DVD. The young singer on that DVD was like another MIchael Jackson of that day. This kid was even doing the moon walk way before Michael. For the DVD, the commetary was good. You get to hear Ike Turner speaking w/ Les McCann about where his ideas fit in for his reveue, interesting. One thing to note, is that the Guanians (?) new who Wilson Pickett was; it's like they only came to see him, and no one else. The last performance of the film shows Picket singing land Of 1000 dances--wow! I mean the audiance went crazy. Watching them dance gets you energized. They start flying over the stage--mosh pit, I think. It's like everything done today by muscians really isn't something just invented, it's been around for years. You can also tell by the African dancers. Man, they really had it--I mean it's just soul, and they show it. ",0

"I sent this to a male friend of mine. I find men difficult to shop for, however this was an excelelnt choice. It actually does project the time onto the wall or ceiling. According to my friend, the alarm works well and is loud enough. There is a unit that you place outside and it recieves the accurate time from an atomic clock that it then broadasts back to the in house unit. It also acts as a thermometer so you know the outside temp. Your man should be pleased with this",0

"I love this book. More often than not, when you go to purchase a drawing book, you see so many books that basically tell you the same things over and over again. This book does what so many other books I've looked at don't. It shows me how to draw not only fantasy figures, but castles, and creatures. Fantastic Realms: Draw Fantasy Characters, Creatures And Settings provides me with solid techniques for shading armor, or weapons and clothing.I'm really happy to have this book a part of my collection. If you are as interested in drawing fantastic scenes as I am, then this is a book you won't want to pass up",1

"As with ALL Shel Silverstein's books, this is amazingly whimsical and creative.  With each new grandchild, I give them a collection of his works.

"The previous review is so right on that it is hard to had anything else to the party, except to say that the real treat for Sons' fans has been the few live dates during the year whenBill Champlin takes a break from touring with Chicago and reallygets down and dirty with his real passion.  Picked up ""Hip LilDreams"" at Tower Records today, and I too am shakin my head in two directions, one with the funky beat, and the other with how come nobody else knows the real lowdown about this baddest ofbands",0
"This is a great book for the youngest readers!  Your little ones will delight in the Gingerbread Cowboy's chase across the barren lands of the Old West as he runs to save his life.  Many animals are after him but he manages to outwit them all, even the clever old coyote, with the help of the rancher's wife.Kids will laugh when they hear the Gingerbread Cowboy chant, "" ... You can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man.""  They will certainly enjoy the colorful illustrations of the animals depicted against the contrasting, muted background of the Old West desert and mountains.Hazel Rochman, BOOKLIST reviewer, describes this story best (see Editorial Reviews above): "" ... universal trickster tale with a cowboy slant.""

"We bought this for my daughter's 3 year birthday and it was a huge hit.  It is very solid, a nice size (almost 4 ft high by almost 4 feet long), big enough for 2 children to play with simaltaneously, and most of all NOT PLASTIC.  My husband and I were amazed at the quality for the price and I think my daughter will get several years worth of play out of it it.  I highly recommend it (keep in mind it took my husband 2-3 hours to assemble)!",0
"Margaret Mead was my professor and advisor.  As such, when I read something attributed to her that doesn't sound like her at all, I want to know where it came from.  Margaret had among many other admirable qualities, the fundamental values of a consumate academic scholar.  Gurian's book bandies her name and her reputation and her purported ideas, without a shred of evidence--not a single reference to a single publication--to back up his misinterpretations of her  work and the exploitation of her honored name in support of his fundamentally ethnocentric preconceptions.  ",1
"There are plenty of Mahler 8ths out there.  Considering the difficulty of the work, it is a wonder.  I actually saw Solti perform the piece in Chicago before he recorded it.  His performance is a benchmark.  But this performance has many attributes that place it with the best.  The soloists are all good, some with rather individual traits that make them stand out (a good thing!).  Wit paces the performance with lyric intensity, without driving it as Bernstein and Solti did.  The sound is some of the best Naxos has ever done.  It is spacious, wide open acoustic, but it is clear and balanced.  Quite an achievement",0
This collection and its companion &quot;Bye Bye Blues&quot; are a treasure trove of well known standards and equally fine lesser known swing and jazz tunes interpreted by the player many professional mandolinists consider THE giant of the instument. Jethro's intimate mandolin lead and Don Stiernberg's guitar accompaniment bring out the essence of the songs and the sound quality is excellent. You can't go wrong with purchasing these. It's issued by David Grisman's label which is an endorsement in itself,0
"This is really a great book on potty training. I have problems with a lot of parenting books being too extreme one way or another. This one was really non judgemental, a quick easy read with good suggestions. If you are looking for a step by step how to you won't get it with this book. The author favors a child driven approach to potty training so a rigourous step by step method wouldn't make any sense. But if you are looking for some good helpful real life tips this is the book for you. It has made me much more relaxed and less stressed about the potty training process and given me some good ideas on how to handle problems if they arise.",1
"This book is hailed for giving females a voice. Although it does speak for women, it really speaks for society as a whole. Just what is happiness? Living in a comfortable house with not a care in the world? Or, defining who you truly are by working hard at whatever you're good at? The story will seem slow at first. There's just character development/background and an introduction to the &quot;troubling&quot; dilemna of Nora in the early parts of the story. The perfect pacing builds up so much until the big devastating end, where the characters make huge life changing revelations. I started questioning what happiness was after reading what the characters went through. Are people so caught up at trying to maintain the ideal image of the &quot;good&quot; life that they forget to find out what they truly want? Real good book, I read the whole thing in one sitting",1
"Slow, brooding and stagy, Dreyer's final film was very much a work swimming against the tide of contemporary cinema.  But of course ""with the times"" means more than showing more, giving more, stripping more away to show more underneath; it means knowing when to stop dissembling in order to show the eternal flaws and raptures of humanness.  And if anyone realised this, it was Dreyer, maker of films about peasant saints, witchery, and vampirism, yet ostensibly a possessor of a modernist aesthetic.Arguably, his last two films -the other being ""Ordet"" (1955)- mark a departure from a rigorously reflexive technique.  Old age or wisdom?  Or two parts of the same side of a coin...whatever, age slows us all and along the way we realise the eternal things with more poise and thought than before.  ""Gertrud"" represents the slowing of a watch in order to show human nature strikes at every hour.  There is the feeling when watching this film that something has been lost.  We forget, however, it was always ours to lose.  And so always ours to regain",0

"In this novel, David Wilcove discusss the relationship of the development of america and wildlife.  Each chapter is broken down into sections chronicaling each section of america.  From the great plains of the midwest to the hawaiian islands, overdevelopment, overhunting and neglagence all have contributed to the loss of wildlife in  america.  The fauna of america were so mal protected for so long, ecologists of the last century have pushed for legisation to protect or furry friends.  This book is a great read of any aspiring ecologist, The only issue i had with the book is that it put no importance on the value of Technological advances, such as roads, buildings, and pesticides.  Overall this is a book that i would recomend to anyone who wanted to know more about the ecological movement in America- GHHS APE",1
"It's about 100 years since Frederick Winslow Taylor introduced the philosophy of ""scientific management"", with its offspring such as the time-and-motion study and the mythical man-month. That's about how long it takes for a big idea to soak into the awareness of managers everywhere - especially those who are more committed to looking good than to managing well.Tom DeMarco, co-author (with Tim Lister) of the magnificent ""Peopleware"", has done it again. Although ""Slack"" runs a little over 200 pages, you will probably read it in less than four hours because it is actually quite hard to put down. You will keep on thinking, ""Yes, I've seen that!"" and ""Those words ring a bell"".In the course of his consultancy practice, which has taken him into many organizations including Apple, HP, Lucent and IBM, DeMarco has noticed a lot of counterproductive management behaviour. Many acts and policies that look good in the short term lead to corporate death in the longer term. More specifically, it is always possible to squeeze out a few more percentage points of ""efficiency"" - but only at the cost of damaging morale, precipitating burnout and losing the flexibility without which sensible decisions cannot be made.Faster isn't always better. Effectiveness matters more than efficiency. People are not interchangeable ""resources"". Without challenge and growth, the best employees soon leave. Overheads are not necessarily bad. Consciously or subconsciously, we already know these things. DeMarco just hammers them home so we will never forget them again.I really have only one quibble with ""Slack"". DeMarco has no business criticising Dilbert and his fellow engineers for ""giving up"" on their pointy-haired bosses. Sure, employees have a responsibility to make allowances and go the extra mile - but the PHBs systematically abuse every extra bit of slack that anyone cuts them. That's part of the joke, of course.This is not just a book that will confirm your suspicions, and reassure you that you are not the one who is going mad. It's a simple, easily-understood message that everyone in business needs to hear. Most of all those right at the top - DeMarco says that many employees have told him, ""I wish my boss could be here now to hear you say that"".",1
"The only book you may ever need in general stock & assignment photography pricing. This is my conclusion after buying several books. Other books discuss the business but left the pricing. So this topic become ""mysterious"" for most photographers starting their business. Well thought and the authors are not afraid explaining their ideas in details. Very useful and serves as reference whenever you need it. For specific subject combine with other book. E.g for nature photography business, combine this book with John Shaw's Nature Photography Business",1

Sammi resents how Jared pressures his sister to change and how Molly not only takes it, but defends his behavior.  Perfect recipe for a love story...This is an incredibly entertaining read whether you're a neatnik or sloppy at heart.  Judy Baer is a very gifted storyteller.  She will have you laughing out loud.",1

It provides 10 principles that have worked for South East Christian Church, and can be adapted and used by any one.  In fact we are encouraged not to try to use a cookie cutter approach.  If I were to recommend two books for church growth, they would be The Purpose Driven Church, and When God Builds a Church",1

"""Will the warrior drain your light?""--- The Prophecy of BaneIn ""Gregor and the Prophecy of Bane,"" Gregor is surprised once again to find himself heading deep under New York, to the Underland. His little two-year-old sister, Margaret (""Boots""), has been spirited away and he learns that the Underlanders believe that rats wish to kill her --- hoping to cause Gregor's ""most essential part"" (his heart) to die before he can kill the Bane. The Bane is a vicious white rat, who Gregor is supposed to be prophesied to kill.As Gregor undertakes a new journey, he learns many new and startling things about himself and faces great loss. But in a story where nothing is as it seems, Gregor finds that little can truly be known before the fact and hope can be found when one has reached the depths of despair. He also meets many new allies, such as Twitchtip and Howard and discovers things he never knew about old ones, such as Luxa and his bond, Aries.I found this to be another moving edition in the series and I think it's a wonderful story for those who enjoy series such as ""Harry Potter."" I'm a fan of Suzanne Collins, having seen her television writing work for such programs as ""Little Bear"" and ""JoJo's Circus."" With this second edition in The Underland Chronicles, Collins proves herself once again of writing a top-notch novel for young adults, and readers of all ages (well, except maybe those who are very young --- this may be a bit too disturbing for them.)Audiobook Review:I have also listened to this book on six-disc audio CD set. Released by Listening Library (who also bring you Jim Dale's ""Harry Potter"" audiobooks), this edition of the story is a masterful telling by Paul Boehmer (of ""Frasier"" and ""Judging Amy,"" among others.) Boehmer brings the story fully to life as he conveys the tides of emotion in Gregor, the cries and playing of his sister Boots, the regal tone of various Underlanders, the savage ferocity of Ripred (underlaid by intelligence and a surprising compassion) and much more",1
"This book is very inspiring, brilliant and incredibly colorful. It showcases some of the great variety of gardens, and also points out the challenges that face the gardener in this northern most New England state. It is well designed, with many large photos, and the reading is very easy, but informative. The photos have been choosen to inspire and delight, and the captions are hardworking-explaining tasks and identifying the plants. A very beautiful piece of work",1
"The only currently available edition of Sir E A Wallis Budge's translation of the famed 'KEBRA NAGAST' combining Budge's eruditon with a poetic sense which the late colonial British were sometimes noted for. Budge's introductory essay alone is worth the price of the book, even if containing some outdated and offensive references to 'Negro savages' and the like. Note: the edition herein is a photo-reproduction of a volume in the Library of Congress, and is missing several pages which, using interlibrary loan services, I have found missing from original copies of the 1922 edition east of the Mississippi; the missing material has been forwarded to African Islamic Mission, but I have no data on whether it has been included since my correspondence. The missing parts include, always, &quot;How Solomon Recognized His Firstborn Son&quot; and &quot;The Plot to Steal the Ark From the Temple in Jerusalem&quot;. The book evinces an origin during a perhaps-apocryphal time when Judaism was the dominat religion in Ethiopia, and shows further evidences of a somewhat-tortuous rewrite when Christianity became dominant; but  the story may have been all an invention from the time of the 'Restoration' of the Solomonic Dynasty under Yekuno Amlak in the 13th Century",1

"It's a bad mistake to trust Mary Gordon to tell the objective truth about anything. This is a woman who sneers at democracy and bashes men for a living. Predictably, she reinvents Joan of Arc in her own image. That is to say, she imagines Joan as a sex-hating, social climbing fascist who despises her own humble origins and drools over the aristocracy. Don't believe me? Check out the interminable passage about how Joan never menstruated. That's Mary Gordon's idea of ""purity.""Joan's real purity came from caring about her family, her friends, and her country, and giving her life for them. But Mary Gordon dismisses Joan's family with a sneer, saying they were ""one more thing she had to escape from."" Tells you a lot about Mary Gordon's feelings about the old neighborhood (The Irish are so frightfully vulgar in Queens, my dear.) Tells you nothing about Joan of Arc. Then there's the problem of men. Common sense tells you that Joan of Arc got along well with soldiers, that she brought out the best in them simply by believing that even the roughest character was capable of compassion and decency. Boy oh boy, is that beyond Mary Gordon's comprehension! Men are pigs, you see, and they betrayed Joan of Arc. Uh, yeah. Only the amazing thing is that they ever followed her in the first place! Joan worked miracles because she believed in men. Mary Gordon ought to try it sometime.",1

If he could have ended with the classic ""I'll be back"" and not really come back to make any number of horrid films we might actually have some decent science fiction. Last good science fiction I saw was Gattaca. Total Recall definitely ain't science fiction and isn't even very good action as compared with say the mindless gore of predator.

"I have already seen success in my son in applying alot of very, very practical approaches to helping with behavior and social skills issues.  My son was always running up to strange dogs and scaring them and their owner.  I applied the technique of telling him what to say and immediately applying on a hike in the mountains.  It was the perfect solution- he repeated exactly what I told him, got a positive response and lots of praise.  He got to practice 10 more times that day and now does well each time he meets a dog!

Made in 1985,  why is it that everyone in this movie put their heart into their performance,  and thus I was mesmerized and delighted.   When you shed a tear for these young people caught up in the tragedy of political manipulation,  it will be no more than the tears of these young actors,  so convincing and so deeply rendered.  How I wish I could own twenty films like this one!   ",0
"I recently picked this up together with a couple of other 1970s disco/funk compilations, and it has been in my CD changer since. I have heard a couple of tracks before, namely ""Bad Girls"" and ""Hot Stuff"", but there is a lot more on here that sounds great and is excellent for grooving to while getting ready for a night out at the clubs. Songs like ""Love To Love You Baby"", ""Enough Is Enough"", ""Last Dance"", ""I Feel Love"" and ""Macarthur Park"" have catchy melodies, meaningful lyrics, and good beats. Compared to anything by current dance/pop acts like Britney Spears and Hilary Duff, I will pick Donna Summer's music any day! That said, this is a great comprehensive collection of The Queen of Disco's work from the 1970s through to the present. The bonus CD of remixes is also great, especially the 12"" extended version of ""Hot Stuff"", which always gives me a good laugh when I hear it, and the 10-minute disco epic ""You're So Beautiful"". If you are just discovering Donna's music for the first time, this is probably the only album of hers you need. There are many other Donna compilations out there, but this one probably has the best remastered sound, and bonus material. This is certainly classy dance music, and after more than 20 years, most of the songs still sound fresh today. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",0

I agree with several of the previous reviewers. I believe that some of the writing on skin tones offers great insight. I also believe that most of the portraits in the book are garish at best. If there were Sears Portrait Studios around before the invention of photography there is no doubt that their portraits would look like these paintings. I would even be okay with that if it weren't for the fact that the book does not even begin to discuss skin tone until halfway through the book. I would say that 1/5 of the book is actually about skin tone. The rest of the book is just like any other beginners How-To. The basics of painting. Unfortunately there is little about skin tone.,1
Picking up a C S Lewis book now as an adult allows one to see the story on two levels.  One is the pure fantasy.  The second gives one a view of the spiritual aspects of life.

"Bought this for my 6-yo niece, who reads very well.  It's a great version of the Cinderella story, set in China.

"I was reluctant to buy Donna's book. My bookshelves are already overflowing with astrology books - many of them unread. But I was captured by her premise. &quot;If you have been practicing for a year and don't feel  comfortable reading an actual horoscope, then this is the book you  need!&quot; I still get the stunned deer look when confronting a chart for  the first time. I start trying to dig through remembrances of past  cookbooks I have read. Donna's anti-cookbook approach teaches you how to  reason astrologically so you can deduce the delineations yourself. It is  not a primer. You need to have the basics firmly in hand that you learned  in the cookbooks.  What she does is show you how to cut through the  clutter, find and read the essential themes in the chart. I strongly  recommend this book to anyone who has studied astrology for a while and is  ready to consolidate their book learning into more easy, flowing  interpretations",1

"Here is a tip I share with the professionals and small service businesses that I teach how to find new clients, culled from this great book on public relations. Thou shall not bribe journalists. If your story isn't good enough for the media, or if your pitch isn't hitting home, regroup, fix the problem, and patch all the holes. Bribing a journalist is buying your way into the publication, and if that's what you want, make life easier for both of you and buy an advertisement. The best way to get a journalist to take your story is to prepare and hone the pitch so it delivers your message and addresses the media's real needs.  The book is filled with rich advice like this",1

"Billy Joel followed up his 1971 album ""Cold Spring Harbor"" with this album which sowed the seeds for the rest of his career.  Known for both his ballads and his ""heavier"" version of rock and roll, Joel has crafted an album which has served as a trademark for much of his career.Of course, the signature song on this album is the title track.  Joel's piano and harmonica bring this song to life as he describes playing piano in a smoky bar while tring to earn a living.  The stereotypical characters, such as the ""real estate novelist"" and ""the old man"" are brought to life by Joel.  ""Captain Jack"" is another memorable song from this album.  The lyrics are a little risque, but the song is still very good.Other tracks, such as ""Travelin Prayer"" and ""Ain't No Crime"" showcase Joel's many talents.  I give this CD my highest recommendation.  I've been a Billy Joel fan for many years, and I still consider ""Piano Man"" to be one of the best albums he has produced.  This album has defined the career of Billy Joel, and it continues to be popular more than thirty years after it was first released.  Listen to ""Piano Man"" and witness the beginnings of one of the greatest rock and roll performers of all-time",0

"This book provides some pretty concise details for 370 pages.  It's very pratical and entertaining to read.  The writing style gives you a feeling of mysteriousness.  However, the writer's insights are disputable; you may not agree with all of the comments he has on things.  Of course that doesn't change the fact this book provides a lot of details on several internet topics one little book",1

"A French saying goes: ""The more things change, the more they stay the same.""  It appears that the ""historical"" epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that ""poetic"" license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies and fabrications as truth.  One of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is D W Griffith's emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth.  Firstly, we all know that this Cameron dude did not start the KKK and that this organisation has its roots in Indiana and not South Carolina.  Secondly, the KKK is not the defender of the South and there is no need to ""purify"" the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by D W is ""preserve the Aryan race.""  Modern science, using cutting edge DNA research has already proved that we all come from the same African man about 60,000 years ago and so any racial distinctions are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well.  Like it or not, we are all related and separated only by about 2000 generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences and have a common ancestor.  Some of the portrayals of Blacks as alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to monkeys I found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed the screenings of this movie.Yes, this movie may have been the first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques but does this excuse the content?  This is not akin to an Einstein discovering relativity folks; every single ""good"" thing about this movie would have been ""discovered/invented"" with or without D W. eventually and very probably very soon after.  Every one of the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the later, talented directors of the time.  The overall lies, attempts to justify racism and the murderous KKK more than make this film fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie's great hall of fame.  They say that racists are not born but bred; this is why I'm not at all surprised at what D W Griffith has done here.  His father was considered a ""hero"" of the Confederate Army where he served as a Colonel.  I'm sure as a bitter loser of the great war, he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a great racist.  This movie has not been preserved all that well with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the soundtrack is too loud and it's quite irritating to have to keep hearing Mendelssohn's overtures over and over again.  In conclusion, the question this movie raises is does freedom of expression mean it's okay to make a mockery of history to further a racist directors' world view?  Also, do you buy the fact that just because this is the first movie that's longer than an hour mean that this should be revered for all time despite its extremely offensive and destructive message?  Like I said before none of the ""techniques"" that this film claims to have ""discovered"" are earth-shattering discoveries that would have required a genius to uncover anyway.  So the bottom line is we have here an extremely racist and hate-inducing film that caused a lot more damage than good; D W Griffith's legacy/mess",0
"The brilliance of this mind writing at a stage of desperation is astonishing.  She wrote the book in six weeks.  Her husband Scott, tormented her upon finding out that she used the same material that he used in Tender is NIght.  It is believed that he was furious with her and induced another breakdown.   The first draft is lost forever, after Scott's editing.  What remains is a sad and tender story of of madness and loss.  The love between Alabama and David is not sugar coated as it is in letters that they wrote to one another.  the Judge comes across as a Biblical figure.  The second part of the book  was one of the best written about dance. ",1
"This book actually takes you past the very basic of plant lists (primarily US native plants) and arranging your garden (although it has all that too).  It gets into things like a chapter on what butterflies see, their life cycles, butterfly watching tips, conservation, photography,pictures of caterpillars, etc.  The photos are fantastic - not just pictures of butteflies on flowers but really close-up pictures of the wings, and butterflies in flight.  They also include information on moths which is neat.  This book is above and beyond the best book I've seen on butterfly gardening.  For those who want to not only attract butterflies but also know what's going on and understand some of their world, this is a great book.  I'd buy it all over again!",1
"Although this book is the followup to Dante's Inferno, I read it first. It is a haunting tale of black people making it to the top. The protagonist in this story is Luther Nedeed. Mr. Nedeed's family moved to Linden Hills(an area no one wanted to be associated with) made it into a funeral home, and eventually starting building cabins and renting them out. Over the years the little community grew and everybody wanted to live in Linden Hills,even the whites who wouldn't asscociate with it at first. Everyone thought that living in Linden Hills was making it, when in fact they were selling their souls for material things..................  You have to read it to find out the rest!!!

"The Society for American Baseball Research has outdone itself again, with a companion book to ""Deadball Stars of the National League;"" appropriately enough called ""Deadball Stars of the American League.""  Following the same manner as the N.L. book, it has short biographies of the major stars for each of the franchises active between 1901 and 1919, complete with many photos. This excellent book again utilized a huge amount of people on the ""Deadball"" Committee of the organization taking part in the writing, editing and fact checking. It's a wonderful book for those wanting a feel of the game in the first decades of the 20th century, and of the players of that time, and I highly recommend it",1

"Not much to add here: 1st CD: The string trio K. 563 is a peer to Mozart's greatest quartets and quintets. Period! The string duos K. 423 and 424 are simple in sound, but rich in texture; the simplicity of means calls for advanced composing and Mozart doesn't dissappoint. 2nd CD: The trio K. 266 is less interesting, but the six preludes and fugues are really great, fusions of Mozart and Bach. All the playing is excellent",0

"A haunting book with an extremely important story to tell. It left me shaken and slightly raw. I still cant get it out of my head. The author's prose skill defies description but whatever style he uses is perfect. His use of symbolism is sublime and necessary. His ability to infuse laughs within the seriousness of this story is gentle and deft.  Graceland is a story of the life of Elvis, a teenage Nigerian Elvis Presley impersonator; his childhood and then his growing up years in a small ghetto set againt the socio-economic and political backdrop of the times. It's a great book and I applaud Chris for telling this story. It was such a harsh dose of reality for me to read, I cant help but feel it must have been very painful for the author to write. It was painful to read it especially given that I was born and raised in Lagos during the eighties, not too far away from Maroko. My pain comes from the fact that I knew of Elvis's world. But that knowledge was vague and alien to me. I lived another kind of life within the same city and within that paradox lies my pain. I can however identify with Elvis' naivete and guiless ability to remain untouched by circumstances.The book is not perfect, no book is. I wanted a post-Afikpo relationship between Elvis and Oye. I wanted to know a bit more about Efua who had been hurt so. I didnt want Gregory's murder to have been left unresolved and Innocent could have been explored just a tiny bit more.All that does not detract from the essence of Graceland though; the clash of old and new, past and present,tradition versus American culture, the hopelessness of mental, financial and physical poverty and oppression, the dizzyness of power,the relationship between crime and survival, and the nostalgic love for home. Lastly, extremely important is the (thematically) remarkable character; Redemption. You will not soon forget him.",1

"I Love this book, but maybe not as much as some of my friends who's comments inspired me to have a look at it.  I am a bloke, I spend a fair amount of my time in nudist environments and most of my intimate partners have been pretty uninhibited (outdoors in daylight as opposed to at home with the lights out).  A conversation amongst some female friends made me realize that I had been very `up-close' with a variety of female genitals in full light and that for most of these girls, that was something they had never experienced, being mostly straight and often not even having just studied the centre of their own womanhood over a mirror.  I felt like I had taken so much for granted, the sacred centre of womanhood that has been the focus of so much since before recorded history, yet for some of those for whom this was part of their physical body they hardly had enough knowledge to recognize it if they were looking at it.  Yet for me, as a bloke, I'd had partners with genitals more like tight lipless pores to one who would joke about the size of her `saddlebags' and I'd had the opportunity to explore them all in detail.  The one thing every one of those vulva, vaginas, clitorises and collective genitals had in common was they were each a major part of a woman's sexuality, part of the physical vehicle to many and much so much more powerful than the `mere physical', part of the Esoteric and the Mystic, the Sacred, the Wicca, so much a part of the powers we still cannot fathom-the soul moving experience of Childbirth, the power of Orgasm and the strength of Motherhood.This book is not a `turn-on', not at the superficial level anyway, but more a celebration of the holy of holies and may move you at a deeper level if you are in tune to the power and sanctity represented.I hope every woman who flicks through this accepts and Loves themselves and their own body more as a result.  Regardless of age, race, size of labia, or anything else, if you land next to me on the beach, be proud of just exactly who you are and the altar in the centre of your temple of womanhood.  My banal and purely functional penis next to your `Femalia' will be humbled alongside all of what your womanhood represents.  Cheers.  Lloyd",1

"Of all the albums the Jacksons released after they departed from Motown, this is probably their best work (with Destiny a VERY close second). A masterpiece, this album will definitely take you back to the days of REAL music by REAL, talented musicians. All of the tracks are great, but the ones that stand out the most are ""Can You Feel It,"" ""Lovely One,"" ""Everybody,"" ""Heartbreak Hotel,"" (one the best songs ever made in my opinion) ""Time Waits For No One,"" and ""Walk Right Now."" If you are an MJ fan, or a Jackson 5 fan, or just a fan of original, REAL music, by real, talented musicians and songwriters, this is an album you should definitely invest in.

"In the first part of the Human Fabric the author says he wrote the book because his friends told him he had a unique ability to explain the types of human personalities and how they interact.  He was right, this is the best description of this topic I have ever read.

I wish I had read this years ago.The book is not long, and is perfect to read over the weekend or on an airplane.  I suggest that everyone read this book, as we all have to interact with other people, and Bijoy Goswami's theories make it easier to understand what motivates folks.Great book!!!",1
What happened to being and underground band with something to say? This CD does not even sound like the same band as the one on their original CD.

The point of a text is to be clear and concise to the reader, but Martin's book falls short on both",1
"In Angela Carter's The Bloody Chamber and Other Stories, the author re-creates the fairy tales of old, melding them into feminist tales of love, loss, lust, and sexuality.   While her stories find their genesis in the childlike versions of Sleeping Beauty, Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, and others, Ms. Carter transforms these fantastical stories into adult renditions where vampires prey on virgins, where children lie down with wolves, and a Count ""thrust his virile member into the dead girl"". In each of these stories, Ms. Carter creates an unexpected, erotic feel which is intertwined with mystery and an adult edginess that goes far beyond the original versions of these fairy tales.  She also is very adept at giving the reader just the right amount of clues, never being too obvious, and respecting her reader's intelligence in unraveling the webs she weaves with these stories.  Ms. Carter additionally has an ability to take what could be mundane aspects of her stories and infuse them with richness which keeps the reader involved in the story, compelling them to read on.  Finally, Angela Carter is a master of symbolism:  the young officer in The Lady of the House of Love as the true measure of life and freedom, the kiss in The Company of Wolves as the conquest of men, the clothing in The Snow Child as a representation of power.  In every story within the pages of The Bloody Chamber and Other Stories Angela Carter's brilliance come through, and her readers are rewarded with lush, rich, compelling, adult stories of adventures born from our childhood fairy tales.

"If you like Brian Greene's `The Elegant Universe,' you should like this book too.  Both books are very comparable in coverage and readability.   While Greene's occupies 448 pages, Halpern's does it in 326 pages.  Main differences between them are in the compassion toward and the coverage thoroughness of inspiring/taunting and for/against views, persons and incidents. In these respects, I enjoyed reading Halpern's more.  Greene tends to write like a story of `String Theory & Einstein;' thus omitting a lot of views, persons and incidents that were or have been inspiring/taunting and for/against Einstein and/or string theorists.  Those omitted by Greene; for examples, how Einstein came to think seriously about the four-dimensional space-time approach developed by Hermann Minokowski, and how several other scientists (in spite of Einstein) followed Kaluza-Klein theory in adding the fifth and more dimensions; are well covered in Halpern's &#8722; together with the `flesh & blood' stories of persons involved and their plights during Nazi's tyranny &#8722; even of Einstein. Compassionately, Halpern tells stories of Edwin Abbott Abbott, Nima Arkani-Hamed, Valentine Bargmann, Peter Bergmann, Niels Bohr, Louis de Broglie, Charlie Chaplin, William Klingdon Clifford, Eugene Cremmer, Stanley Deser, Bryce Seligman DeWitt, Savas Dimopoulos, Paul Dirac, Georgi (Gia) Dvali, Arthur Eddington, Paul Ehrenfest, Albert Einstein, Richard Feynman, Abraham Flexner, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Murray Gell-Mann, Howard Georgi, Sheldon Glashow, Michael Green, Werner Heisenberg, David Hilbert, Charles Howard Hinton, Banesh Hoffmann, Pascual Jordan, Bernard Julia, Theodor Franz Eduard Kaluza, Immanuel Kant, Oskar Benjamin Klein, Hendrik Kramers, Hendrik Lorentz, James Clerk Maxwell, Walther Mayer, Hermann Minokowski, Gunnar Nordstrm, Wolfgang Pauli, Lisa Randall, Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann, Abdus Salam, Jol Scherk, Erwin Schrdinger, John Schwarz, Julian Schwinger, Raman Sundrum, Richard Tolman, Steven Weinberg, H.G. Wells, Hermann Weyl, John Wheeler, Edward Witten, Chen Ning (Frank) Yang, Hideki Yukawa, Johann Zllner, etc.  Having gone through similar `publish or perish' experience, though likely in a much less fierce arena, I can imagine their - like stated by Einstein &#8722; ""the years of anxious searching in the dark, with their intense longing, their alternations of confidence and exhaustion, and final emergence into the light.""  Ironically, Halpern even covers the first and second superstring revolutions better than Greene. But one should not overlook the fact that Halpern, writing after, had about five years to improve on Green's.  Another major difference between these two books, that one may pick up as a criticism against Halpern's, is in the explicit mentioning of the successes of string theory, so far. Rather explicitly, Greene claims successes of string theory in: solving the conflict between Einstein's general relativity and quantum mechanics, settling that the fabric of space can tear, solving a central puzzle concerning Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes, and rationally modifying the conclusions of cosmic origins.  But, my guess is that Halpern - unlike  Greene  -  apparently belonging to an impartial party  needs not feel obliged to try hard to sell the product, string theory. ",1
"Every time I watch this, I like it better.  The two most outstanding features are Maggie Smith and the Umbrian setting.  Just to spend my viewing time looking at that house is heavenly.  And Maggie Smith is an actress you can count on to give an outstanding performance.  Then just look at her clothes -- see how great an older woman can look!!

"I've got to admit, I'm not proud of my initial reaction to these wonderful selections -- that they seemed &quot;atypical&quot; of what I think of as the Italian-American perspective.

"This uplifting and poignant little novel is probably how Saroyan will best be remembered. Saroyan's faith in the inherent goodness of human beings, even in the midst of the horrors of WWII, remained unshaken, and the book is populated by memorable characters who somehow manage to transcend the banal, evil vicissitudes of the war without being dehumanized and debased by it, as many others were. But Saroyan's unshakable and seemingly naive faith in people was belied by the stark reality of the war, and after WWII his fame declined, although he had been one of the most famous writers of the period between the two wars, including a stint on Broadway where he wrote many plays in addition to his novels. But this book remains a vivid and appealing testament to a failed belief in a noble idea of a human race that unfortunately doesn't exist. If only humans were truly like this, and this noble, but unfortunately for Saroyan and for his legacy, they aren't",1

"I consider this to be one of the finest live Coltrane recordings out there.  It was also one of the first Coltrane albums I picked up, and it was a fantastic gateway to some of his more abstract live recordings on followup releases like LIVE AT THE VILLAGE VANGUARD AGAIN and LIVE IN JAPAN.  This is much more similar to AFRO BLUE IMPRESSIONS which is another overlooked release.  By this point in time, Trane had already done some work with Eric Dolphy and his playing was growing in a much more abstract direction as we would hear on A LOVE SUPREME just one year later.One of the reasons why this disc is overlooked is because Elvin Jones is replaced by Roy Haynes, while Jones was serving some jail time.  The absence of Jones is noticeable but I still think this is worthy of five stars.  The first 3 tracks are from the Newport Jazz Festival and in addition to Haynes and Trane, we have the remaining quartet members, McCoy Tyner (piano) and Jimmy Garrison (bass).  Tyner is especially amazing on 'My Favorite Things' which I consider the best version of that piece in Trane's entire catalogue.  I consider it to be a bridge to some of his later recordings.  This is because we get Trane's two sides.  First of all there is great tone and lyricism in the first part of the piece.  However, the song still goes on for 17 minutes and the interplay between Tyner and Haynes for much of it is amazing. Rounding out the performance is Billy Eckstine's 'I Want to Talk About You' with a mesmerizing credenza which is a staple of Trane's technique, followed by a 15 minute version of 'Impressions.'  Again we hear Trane's two sides.  On one hand we hear where he is COMING from. which is the confines of other jazz gods like Miles Davis and Thelonius Monk.  On the the other hand we can see where he is GOING, which is a much more abstract/free-jazz approach.  Once you can begin to understand Trane's more abstract side, you will find later recordings less challenging, such as INTERSTELLAR SPACE, MEDITATIONS, or A LOVE SUPREME.  In addition to the three Newport recordings, there is an extra track from November of 1961 from the Village Vanguard.  'Chasin' Another Trane' is played by Haynes and Trane as well as Dolphy on alto sax and Reggie Workman on bass.  The presence of Dolphy and the removal of piano makes this the most avant-garde piece on the record, almost reminiscent of early Ornette Coleman.  Coltrane really cooks on this record, and the sound quality is also pretty decent.  It's not as crystal clear as his Carnegie Hall concert with Monk, but nevertheless, I consider it a great place to start for Trane fans who are reluctant to embrace his later music.   ",0
"Dr. Larry Long's book saved the day for me.  I was trying to network three computers to a printer using the Linksys WPS54G Wireless USB print server.  I was not able to accomplish this and then I remembered I had bought this book.  Dr. Long explains in his book that Windows treats a networked printer as a local printer.  So when I installed my printer software on my laptop and second desktop I had to indicate that I was installing to a local printer attached to my computer (it's attached via the network).  One does not choose Network Printer (which seems like the logical choice).  Installation was a breeze after I read Dr. Long's chapter on sharing printers, files and an Internet connection.  Thank you Dr. Long.  Your book saved the day for me",1
"Joan and Mark de Brecon are all alone in this world.  Their home was captured and parents killed by order of Guy Leighton, an evil knight reputed to be Roger Mortimer's assassin. Roger Mortimer, by the way, is the Queen's lover. Guy was ordered to the Brecon keep to destroy it and also dispose of the entire family, but he became enamored with Joan and so struck a bargain with her: In exchange for Mark's life, she would become his lover.Joan endured the horror of being with Guy every night until she and Mark were able to escape. They made it to London where Joan was able to find work as a tiler and make money on the side by selling religious statues she made out of clay.  While she's at the market selling her wares, she meets Rhys, a wealthy freemason who has done work for the royal family. He rescues Joan several times, first when one of Mortimer's squires attacks her and also when he finds her in the town stocks, punished for selling damaged statues.Rhys and Joan are drawn to each other but Joan is like a wounded animal, fiercely attacking anyone who tries to come near her and refusing to trust anybody. Through his kindness, Joan learns to trust Rhys but not entirely for she refuses to share the horrific story of what happened to her family or that her and Mark are on the run.  Despite what her head tells her, Joan loses her heart to Rhys and just when she's starting to relax, her past catches up with her.I think the best thing about this story is the author's prose.  She weaves a beautiful tale of two souls melded into one. It's something so special that you won't see the words ""I love you"" anywhere in the story, because to add to it will simply take away from it. Who else can use words to paint a picture of the coming together of two people as they work together to do something so ordinary as molding clay?I am enamored with this tale. The storyline is solid with plenty of subplots to add a sense of richness to it. Rhys and Joan have to navigate dangerous intrigue to stay alive and also to bring to justice the man who murdered Joan's parents and raped her repeatedly. I don't have any complaints nor see anything lacking in the story. Needless to say, Madeline Hunter is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors.  She is as gifted a writer as they come.",1
"Although it takes liberties with the plot of Charles Dickens' classic, David Lean's 1948 version of OLIVER TWIST brilliantly captures the darkness and desolation, as well as the grotesqueness and humor, of its source.  John Howard Davies as Oliver is the picture of angelic innocence.  His underworld nemeses include Alec Guinness, the most repulsive Fagin imaginable; Robert Newton, perfect as the murderous Bill Sikes; and the teenage Anthony Newley, an intense and authentically Cockney Artful Dodger.  Kay Walsh is excellent as the doomed Nancy, though I personally would prefer a more youthful depiction of the character.  With its vivid cast and masterful direction, Lean's stirring yet unsentimental OLIVER TWIST is surely one of the finest films ever made of a Dickens novel",0
"I am a drummer. And therefore am a bit partial to drums. I prefer music that is mostly percussive. Fusion tends to be more percussive than most. But Brand X (with Phil Collins anyway) always delivers. First of all Phil Collins DOES play drums on .&quot;..and so to f...&quot; also my favorite song here. Phil wrote it, does some vocal rhythmic scatt type stuff on it,percussion, drums. Percy Jones is also on this recording. Sorry, I also like &quot;Don't Make Waves&quot; and &quot;Soho&quot;, with Phil's vocals, as I like Genesis too. But they don't really sound like Genesis either. I would rate this as one of the top three Brand X recordings along with 'Unorthodox Behaviour&quot; and &quot;Moroccan Roll&quot;. Musicians appearing on this recording are: Mike Clarke (drums on two tracks), Phil Collins (drums on seven tracks), John Goodsall (guitars) John Giblin (Bass on seven tracks), Robin Lumley (keyboards, etc.), Morris Pert (percussion on two tracks), Peter Robinson (keyboards on two tracks), and Percy Jones (bass on three tracks - one of which also has Percy Jones on bass as well). This was basically recorded with two groups of musicians. One group playing &quot;Dance of the Illegal Aliens&quot; and &quot;Not Good Enough&quot;, the other group playing the other seven songs. I am a bit partial to this recording however as it was also my first Brand X acquisition. It went very well with the water, sand and beach where I was vacationing at the time. I just enjoyed it very much",0
"I found this book from a HISTORY TV channel story featuring the author.  As a baby-boomer I saw the movie WAKE ISLAND several times, but didn't realize it was made before any of the actual participants had returned from the POW camps.  There is more Hollywood fiction in the movie than historical fact.  But that's show business.  The author covers in great detail the actions by major commands, individuals and everybody in-between.  Considering how badly Wake was prepared to defend itself, the Marines did a great job for two weeks holding off superior forces.  If only there had been more construction effort put into beach defense and airplane protection before Dec 7th.   The Japanese underestimated the resistance in their first landing attempt.  I was also surprised how close US forces came to rescuing the defenders, but were called off at the last moment.  This a great book for Marine fans of WWII",1

"One reviewer says that the animals in this novel are presented in a way that is ""fantasy,"" but elephants are highly intelligent animals. (I hope I'll be forgiven a brief sidebar here.) Two elephants named Max and Patty, for example, tricked their zookeeper/trainer at night when they were supposed to go inside. The trainer always left two treats inside so that both elephants would go in and he could shut the door. One evening at ""bedtime,"" Max went inside but Patty didn't. Then Max came out with his treat, and Patty went in and came back out with hers. So now the're both out and they each have a treat.  How did they make this plan and communicate it to each other? And notice that Max didn't take both treats! He left Patty hers. They are loyal, and they know how to share.Some readers/reviewers have different things they would have liked more or less of, depending largely on whether they prefer plot-driven or character-driven stories. I think that Sara Gruen has done a masterful job of creating a novel that is both: tell a fascinating and historically accurate story with distinct, memorable characters who are vividly portrayed. If I had to choose something I'd have liked more of--without giving the story away (These are not supposed to be summaries/synopses, are they?)--I'd say a more-detailed treatment of what happened (Rosie included) between the story's climax (just after, especially) and the touchingly satisfying ending. But I'm not complaining. Water for Elephants is a treasure, a jewel of a book",1

"This album is an absolute work of art. Each song so filled with emotion that it is bursting. This work is gleefully nothing like Nuno's previous band and should be given a serious listen. This masterpiece runs the gamut of all musical styles all performed with equal taste and skill.

"Young Priscilla lives on a planet where everything is pink. The sky is pink, the grass is pink. Why, even Priscilla's cheeks are pink. Sure, pink is a lovely color, but when it's the only one, it can get quite boring. So, Priscilla sets out to find a new place in the world where pink is just one of many colors, and soon she is brought on a magical adventure filled with Queen's, butterflies, and colors.In the footsteps of Dr. Seuss, Nathaniel Hobbie has created an utterly delightful new children's book filled with a wonderful verse that will hold even the most reluctant reader's attention. His wonderful rhymes are descriptive, as well as imaginative, and coincide fantastically with Jocelyn Hobbie's gorgeous illustrations which truly bring PRISCILLA AND THE PINK PLANET to life. This is a must-have book for all families, whether their children are young or old, that will ultimately go down in children's book history.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspape",1

"I have recently started reading James Patterson.  I have quickly come to enjoy his work on the Alex Cross series.  That's why I chose to try this book.  What a mistake!I could not get over the fact that Patterson was attempting some form of cross between mystery and science fiction.  Obvious potential storyline (what happens to the parents of the children?) was lost for tiring character development.  It takes way too long for the villan of the story to come forward and actually play a part.  Then, when he does, not much happens.  It felt as though a quarter of the book was spent developing the feelings of two characters towards eachother and then maybe 5 chapters (out of over 100) spent resolving the problem.Due to the excitement I have had in reading the Alex Cross novels, I felt it was difficult putting this book down.  Burning eyes and constant yawning fought me as I tried to search for something to happen.  Once it did, it was over.  I have never been so glad to complete a book and put it away.  I hope James Patterson does not venture down this path again",1
"I was hesitant at first to read this Gospel, but once I got into it, it clarified so many questions for me. I find it's stories and parables more complete and explained more in depth than I could find in the Bible. I would not recommend this book with out knowing the Bible first, this Aquarian Gospel really made me look at Jesus' teaching more clearly. I very much enjoyed this book and it has helped me in my search for the Way of Christ",1
"The ""mature"" years are so often neglected in film, unless it's as the butt of a joke.  Not here, however.  The incomporable Gena Rowlands plays a character whose intelligence and self-possession seem an extension of Rowlands herself, making it a very good fit.  Seeing a woman who has raised her children and is now searching for what to become is a refreshing storyline.  Tomei adds marvelous support as the ""white trash"" neighbor, and I really appreciated how the director never gave us easy answers for these characters.  Tomei never turns into a lady, and Rowlands never quite figures out where she is going:  she merely decides to take the journey.  The character of Tomei's son adds a touching poignancy to the story, highlighting Rowland's search for identity at this late stage in her life.  This film doesn't jump up and tell you what it's about; it quietly presents Rowland's life and lets you figure it out--perhaps this requires a little more thinking than some viewers would like.  Unlike other films that on first viewing seem obtuse, all the answers are there in ""Unhook the Stars"" if the viewer takes time to look for them.  Every performance is subtly nuanced and adds to the theme (a good example is the luncheon scene with the adult son and his wife.  Watch the subtle interplay between those two and you will know all you need to know abou their relationship-and why Rowlands chooses not to live with them.)  This is a terrific film that can be enjoyed by thinking adults, and might particularly speak to men or women who have reached retirement age and are beginning to reevaluate their identity",0
"More hilarious satire (in letter form) from ""Ted L. Nancy"" who writes these jaw-droppingly unbelievable letters to corporations, governments, businesses and individuals, and the most remarkable part is, more often than not he gets a reply from these poor souls who try to piece together the meaning of Nancy's deadpan inquires about such inanities as the wearing of costumes on public buses, a hotel's policy on dealing with a chronic bedwetter who wishes to check in. A very funny book in a goofy collection",1
"Maisie trys out for the wrestling team and makes it, but no matter how hard she tries she always gets into trouble by her coach. Being the only girl on the the team isn't easy either. No one wants to wrestle with her. But then she meets a friend on the wrestling team his name is George Bamberger, when the team would do warm-ups they were always partners. All through the summer Maisie has has a crush an a guy named Eric Delong, who also happened to be on the wrestling team. Meanwhile, the matches had started . When the other teams realized that their 105 pounder would be wrestling a girl they would forfiet. She went through matches undefeated by forfiets. which was great in a way but on the other hand she was very upset because no one supported her for wrestling because she was a girl,but then finally there was a team that their wrestler wasn't afraid to wrestle her. Even though she lost she was still very happy that she actually got to wrestle. I loved the book it was very awesome Spinelli is a very skilled writer and his book was great.

"With a title like Demon Seed, you would most likely expect a horror movie to be a cheap, exploitative son-of-the-devil piece of drive-in garbage. However, Donald Cammell's Demon Seed, based on the novel by Dean Koontz is anything but. It is an extraordinarly well-made, intelligent and thoroughly suspenseful thriller. Anything involving computers is naturally going to be dated as soon as it hits the screen, so the concept of an enormous supercomputer that has a built-in ""dialogue room"" seems a bit silly nowadays. But this was perfectly appropriate for 1977. In the movie, scientist Dr. Alex Harris heads up a team that has created the ultimate supercomputer. A machine that is essentially an artifical brain, completely capable of thinking and reasoning.  It is so smart in fact that in four days it single-handedly develops a cure for leukemia. However, as we all know from a century of science fiction stories, disaster is on the horizon. Before long, the computer gets to be too smart. Its brain gets to be too complex to be confined inside an electronic box. Being a hyperintelligent supercomputer, it devises a solution. It must procreate with a human and its child will be free to experience the world, hands on. The computer eyes Dr. Harris' wife, played by Julie Christie, and forces her to be the carrier of its ""demon seed"".It sounds trashy, but the film is thoroughly intelligent, believable and quite scary. The computer, Proteus IV, is an evil monster that makes HAL 9000 of 2001: A Space Odyssey look friendly in comparison. Demon Seed is always suspenseful, terrifying and yet another disturbing reminder of why technology is not always as great as it seems. This is a great sci-fi/horror thriller that I highly recommend",0

"Truly enjoyed this exceptional piece of work.  Very diverse music while maintaining the country base all the way through.  You can really appreciate all of their musical influences growing up.   Their writing is exceptional on ""Red Dirt Road"", ""When We Were Kings"", etc. etc. etc.   Don't know if there is anyone in country music today with a finer tenor then Dunn.  He shines on this CD especially on ""I Used To Know This Song By Heart"".  Kix sounds great as well.Surprised more songs weren't released off of this CDs.  I think they went into this as wanting to express their musical influences and not necessarily to release radio friendly songs.  I REALLY ENJOYED ALL OF THE SONGS ON THIS ONE.   There are some songs that really make you stop and think/reflect which is what country music is all about.ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CD.  THE MORE I LISTEN TO IT THE MORE I LOVE IT.   KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK BROOKS & DUNN. ",0
"Everyone who's written reviews below about ""Earl"" talk about how funny the show is, and it certainly is hysterically, laugh-out-loud, funny, featuring terrific dialogue and genius timing. But no one's mentioned that every episode is also quietly moving and elegant in its structure, without ever feeling forced or preachy. In every episode, thanks to Earl's good deeds, everyone gets what they deserve, good triumphs over evil (or over just stupid and venal) in a structure as elegant as any on t.v. The show's a marvel, and its ability to move from screwball farce to gently moral tale takes it from solid craft into the realm of true art. If it can't be sustained for years and years, let's just be grateful for Season 1.",0

"This majestically brilliant album is an exploration of traditional standards from one of the most distinctive and celebrated voices of our generation.Look at the title of the album, scan the songs, and even before you hear a word soar in on Regina's voice - this intimate, smoky, perfectly tuned, velvet-gloved nylon spring of a voice - you start to wonder... It's poignant , fresh , engaging , moving and elegant.I was a little startled when I first listened to this CD.  Ms. Belle  has a very unusual voice that can be a bit distressing at first. However, I gave the album a second listen and found I loved it. Her voice is foggy and beautiful; giving the songs she sings a wonderful uniqueness.' Lazy Afternoon ' is a collection of jazzy melodies to be treasured. With Ms. Belle's stunning presence and voice, it wouldn't surprise me at all if some  film producers or movie directors like Sipike Lee, Woody Allen, Ang Lee or George Clooney discover this album and feature it and her in some well-acclaimed films of the future, and raise her stock considerably.If that happens, well folks, you read it here first. I heartily recommend this lady's music to all.",0

"A great mystery or thriller is really about something else. Here Swain explores the mysteries of fatherhood from cradle to adulthood within the context of another primer on casino crime and the War against Terror.Jerry, Tony's son, has gone to Vegas to learn how to count cards at a shadowy school for cheats. Nick surmises that Tony's purpose was not only to help teach Jerry how to catch cheaters but to see how well he was able to resist the temptations of cheating. By all objective standards Jerry can't, falling in with a couple of Middle-Eastern card counters with more than larceny on their minds.Tony arrives in Vegas to teach three casino operators about a new Palm Pocket-like device called a Deadlock that can dramatically change the odds in the bettor's favor. Once there he becomes wrapped up in a new love interest as well as failing fortunes of Nick, whose Acropolis casino is rapidly heading for the dustbin of history. When Jerry's companions attract the attention of the FBI, the usually fast paced Swain slips into hyper drive. Then the tale rockets along to a thrilling climax in the desert suburbs.This series may well be the most important new arrival since Michael Connelly and Harry Bosch made their debut. It's pure pleasure from start to finish.",1
"I hate to be that curmudgeonly reviewer, but I have to say, this album simply isn't good. I have a rather eclectic and flexible taste in music, and I tend not to think worse of music that's far outside the genre borders of stuff I enjoy.This is within those borders. It's not good. I got this album on advice that it was similar to other good sadcore singer/songwriters I love - Elliott Smith, Red House Painters, Nick Drake, Jose Gonzalez. It IS square in the middle of the 'indie' genre. It is NOT Elliott Smith or Nick Drake.The songs are plodding and repetitive, the instrument playing is harsh, clumsy and unrefined, and for as broad a variety of vocalists that I think are great, or at least enjoyable, this fellow seems to have troulbe hitting the notes and even more trouble holding them. This is something akin to Ben Folds, minus skill on the piano, vocals... or, musical talent in general. The second track, ""Little Lords"", is the closest to enjoyable listening. Decent strumming on the guitar. Then it repeats, the vocals get a little wobbly, and it repeats, the vocals fly off the tracks, and finally, goes nowhere. The 1 star is just for the first 20 seconds or so of this track. And because zero stars isn't an option.I see that other folks like this music so I'll finally assert that it's ""not for everybody"". But approach with caution. I think many folks who like awesome riffs, excellent vocals and great guitar will want to feed this CD to the dog",0

"How can I describe Mr. Hanky in polite language? A scatological figure maybe. In reality he is more of a post-modern take on Jiminy Cricket. If you watch the show he is the most sincere out of all of the characters. He always manages to wrap up the episodes he is on with a sincere and happy ending. Also, as is made clear in the first episode he is on, he is a suitable holiday figure for people who are non-denominational. Anyway, I seriously think the creators of South Park should create a Mr. Hanky spin-off series. Having to cope with an alcoholic wife and disabled son, I think Mr. Hanky could use the money. As they say in the song, ""if you eat fiber on Christmas eve, Mr. Hanky will be sure and come down your tree""",0
"I have to admit, I don't normally read these type of books, since I'm usually more into the science fiction/fantasy type. I stumbled onto the audiobook version of the Dearest Dorothy series and realized with a shock that I actually liked it! The characters are endearing and can be quite funny sometimes. After awhile, you felt as though you really know these people and are a part of their small community.I liked Dorothy's cheerful attitude. Her closeness to God is actually refreshing. It blends in well with the plot. I'm now hooked to the series and I'm looking forward to buying the latest book",1

"The familiar themes of Ozu are once again on display in this heart warming masterpiece of marriage and a womans right to choose. Set in post-war Japan, the film stars the usual Ozu actors: (Chishu Ryu) and the magnificent (Setsuko Hara). The film opens with the three generation Mamiya family undergoing a generational crises. [A common theme in Ozu's films]. There have been many changes now that the war is over. One of these is the infusion of western values, and how these changes are altering Japan. And nowhere is this more felt than in the traditional values and lives of the Japanese household. The film focuses on Noriko (Setsuko Hara), who is the 28-year-old daughter which the family believes does not want to marry. This becomes serious in the Mamiya household, as tradition states that the older she gets, the more difficult it will be for her to find a suitable husband to marry later on in her life: Time is of extreme importance. Moreover, the family must approve of the husband as tradition dictates: For the family, this decision is extremely important in Japanese society, and it is important that Noriko marry someone of a higher status. Yet Noriko's independence [she has her own job helping to support the family] is considered disrespectful to the old traditions of Japan.Ozu as usual has created a masterful and profound film dealing with a genrerational conflict. The changes occuring in Japan during the time of the filming shows [not tells] the societal changes that are also occuring throughout Japan. The Mamiya family is but one small snapshot of the changes that are occuring in this new Japan. And yet, there are the traditional family values that still remain. The film's nuances, which Ozu was remarkable in creating are infused throughout the film. This is a masterpiece of cinemea, and belongs in your film collection. The CRITERION DVD is great, and well worth the purchase. The film is beautiful and profound. Highly recommended. [Stars: 5+",0

"By the time I got my draft card the Vietnam War was just about over; besides I am deaf in one ear so they were never going to take me and making any sort of decision was a moot point.  Today what I find interesting that is although I basically lived through the Vietnam War, I do not have the same sense of what happened during the war that has defined all American military action ever since that I do for the Civil War or World War II.  For that matter, I think I have a better understanding of the chronology of the American Revolution and Desert Storm than I do of the war in Vietnam.  Fortunately, this Eyewitness Books volume devoted to the ""Vietnam War"" helps me move a bit beyond the sketchy understanding I had when I open the book (basically, something that happened in the Gulf of Tonkin was used as an excuse to escalate American military involvement, the corrupt government of South Vietnam fell, the Tet offensive surprised everybody, Nixon bombed enemy troops in Cambodia, there was a massacre at My Lai, and we left by helicopters).Of course, Stuart Murray goes back a bit further, beginning with the War in French Indochina that led to the independence movement for Vietnamese independence led by Ho Chi Minh.  The French defeat at Dien Bien Phu and the Geneva Accords set the group for American advisors begin sent after the end of the First Indochina War.  Once we get to the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, the Vietnam War begins in earnest.  Murray sets up the two sides in terms of their allies, leaders, and capital cities.  Operation Rolling Thunder began the bombing of North Vietnam, while the Ho Chi Minh Trail was the network of wilderness routes used to by the North to get troops and supplies to the South.  The chronology of the war continues throughout the book interspersed with looks at specific elements of fighting the war.The struggle for the Central Highlands, battles in the Mekong Delta, and the war on inland waters are detailed.  The massacre at My Lai is covered in the look at villages in wartime, followed by the siege of Khe Sanh and the Tet Offensive, Hamburger Hill is part of the beginning of the U.S. withdrawal, and the last air assaults, including the Christmas bombing before the Paris Peace Accords.  Finally, we get to the fall of Saigon and the Aftermath both there and here.  In between the history of the war there are chapters devoted to Napalm and Agent Orange as key part of chemical warfare, a look at the weapons of war on both sides, what it was like to go on patrol and be ambushed by the VC, and what medical care meant on both sides is covered as well.  Other chapters are devoted to Heliborne warfare, warplanes in combat, the tunnels used by the Viet Cong, and the story of Prisoners of war.  What the war was like at home is also covered, with chapters on ""The Television War,"" and the antiwar movement.There is additional information provided in the back of the book.  The ""Did you know?"" section devotes a page to Fascinating Facts while another provides Questions and Answers about the ""domino theory"" and other topics.  It might be better positioned in the front of the book, but there is a Timeline of the Vietnam War that begins with the Indochina struggle (1945-46) and ends with the final Communist offensive capturing Saigon on April 30, 1975.  There are so few chapters devoted to the history (read chronological) aspects of the war that these two-pages actually provide more details.  The back of books like this often come up with places you can go to Find out more, but they rarely provide the information is as interesting a way as this book does: it lists memorials around the world and other places to visit, as well as lifting useful web sites.Of course since we are talking about an Eyewitness Book it is filed with dozens of illustrations showing the people and places, weapons and items, being talked about in each chapter.  These images are culled from a dozen museums and libraries around the world, including not only the Library of Congress and the National Archives, but also the U.S. Army and the National Vietnam War Museum.  Ironically, I was so into reading what Murray had written about the war that I had to go back and check out the illustrations and their informative captions on a second read through the book.  Certainly, ""Vietnam War"" provides more than an introduction to the subject, covering the key elements.  Other books can provide you with more depth on the subject, but as is usually the case the breadth here is rather impressive",1

"This album is PHENOMENAL. Where am I coming from when I say this? Well, Mr. Bungle is probably my favorite band ever, and Patton is my favorite performer. However, I've never been excited about any of Fantomas or Tomahawk's releases. In fact, I've found them quite disappointing, and I never listen to my copies of any of them. So I'd kind of given up on Fantomas altogether until I saw the Director's Cut for $6.99 used a few weeks back and figured ""what the hell"". I don't know what it is about the music on this CD, but I haven't been this satisfied with a Patton release since I first heard Mr Bungle back in 1997, and then again after California was released some years later. SO TO SUMMARIZE: I never thought I would be this impressed with the work of Mike Patton again. Every song on this album is unique and incredibly satisfying. Just so you don't think I'm some drooling fanboy who gives rave-reviews to every album, I'll rate a few other Bungle/Fantomas albums as well for you so you can get a gauge on my levels-Mr. Bungle S/T- A+Disco Volante- BCalifornia- AFantomas S/T- CDelirium Cordova- BSuspended Animation- B+**The Director's Cut**- A+(by the way, if you still haven't heard Dillinger Escape Plan's 4 track release starring Mike Patton, that's another MUST BUY album)",0

"Walzer's historical approach to examining just war theory is, I think, the most useful way to understand morality in war. That is so because empirical facts back up all the philosophical evaluations. Walzer describes experience and draws conslusions here; he is laying a philosophical foundation and implying, if not prescribing, moral norms from which the rules have been extracted. Be forewarned, he does not cut the reader any slack. This book requires some serious attention to the author's train of thought.  Just war theory has two categories: the justice of going to war, and the justice of fighting once in a war. Walzer's discussion usefully and clearly separates the two and examines via historical events what we regard as right and wrong within each sphere. In doing this he has done the modern world a tremendous service. His logical breakdown speaks to thousands of years of tradition about what thinkers have considered right and wrong in war. One of the best outcomes of this landmark work is the complete debunking of the notion that ""all is fair in love and war."" That is the path of least moral resistance (or as Clausewitz would say, ""friction""), yet we all know that soldiers are honored for fighting well and loathed for behaving like armed thugs and murderers. What is amazing from the discusion is the realization that Walzer knows he has to attack that age-old notion, something our collective sense of justice has historically always rejected.  Yet it remains a prevailing idea for many.  Originally coined by the Romans it seems (Walzer quotes them, ""In war the laws are silent""), they themselves were self-consciously contrite over the fates they inflicted on the Greeks and Carthginians.  The book rates five stars for rigorously addressing this issue alone.Some make the mistake of thinking Walzer is a pacifist--far from it.  On the otherside some critics find his argument about ""supreme emergency"" a moral failure and a cop-out.  The case of Nazi Germany is his paradigmatic case of supreme emergency, one where normal rules may be relaxed, if ever so little, because of the especially pernicious nature of state-sponsored genocide.  The same relaxation of restraints would likely apply to Islamic terror. In contrast Walzer does not see Imperial Japan, for instance, as having represented a supreme emergency, and so the atomic bombings and the fire bombings of cities could not be morally justified. Readers may want to compare his view to Paul Fussell's perspective in the essay ""Thank God for the Atom Bomb.""Significantly for current events, readers interested in the distinction between pre-emptive and preventive war will find a well articulated argument here. The US attack on Iraq was and still is often justified as pre-emptive.  That impulse on the part of the neo-conservatives who devised or whipped up the casus belli reflects, I think, a need to cloak a morally questionable war in the robes of legitimacy. There is no way that attack can be justified under the historically accepted norms of ""pre-emption."" Michael Walzer's well-thought distinction between pre-emption and prevention makes sense even in the milieu of asymmetric warfare against terror and Islamic radicalism, and it clearly shows why the Iraq war was a moral mistake from the start, regardless of its practical success down the road, if we are fortunate enough to see that. The moral precedent of engaging in preventive war will continue to haunt America long into the future. The fact that Iraq was not even on the spectrum where the fine line between pre-emption and prevention exists is a telling aspect of the overall ongoing strategic fiasco.  Where one fails to recognize the moral high ground, one is doomed to moral failure. Walzer was vocal about the run-up to war in 2003, and those who read his book would do well to find his comments about the Iraq invasion; they are edifying in terms of understanding the overall argument and where we are going in this role as the world's police force",1

"Granted, the divorce rate is at 50% in our country, but what is it in other countries? It's easier here to give up, or to make a hasty decision to get married.  The institution of marriage isn't what's wrong, it's the people who use bad judgement and who don't believe in having to work for something worthwhile.  Nothing worthwhile comes easy, and I for one, believe that Kipnis advocates the easy way out - she is a proponent of succumbing to lust and desire over deeper more meaningful states of loyalty and commitment which sustain the longevity of a relationship.  She fails to address what happens when children come into the equation, and what happens to the family as an institution when monogamy is thrown aside.  What then? What kind of society would this be if parents were free to pursue a better sex life and abandon the responsibility of providing an emotionally stable household structure? Though she poses interesting questions that elicit strong reactions in both directions, she fails to propose a viable solution, and her polemic only results in coming off as more of a rant than a productive piece of literature.

"""FOR A LOST SOLDIER"" A Tough Call Amos Lassen and Cinema Pride \ When I first saw ""For a Lost Soldier"" (Strand Releasing) several years ago I found it shocking so I decided it was time t revisit it now and see where it fits in the canon of gay film. I was still somewhat shocked by it but I will say that it is a beautiful, engrossing and somewhat shocking film. In the movie a twelve year old boy who escapes from the tyranny of Nazism in the Netherlands finds himself be taken care of by s sympathetic family. The boy has gay tendencies but is not aware of them until he meets a Canadian soldier who is gay. They become friends despite a considerable age difference and the soldier uses the boy sexually while the boy, in turn, falls in love with the soldier. When the soldier leaves abruptly, the boy?s heart is broken. The pain of that separation haunts the kid through his adult life and as the movie attempts to show the healing of the pain, we find how sympathetic we are. The best word to describe this film is ?powerful?. Yes, the subject matter is shocking but actually it is more than just shocking. It becomes powerful in the hands of an extremely skilled director, Roeland Kerbosch, and what a shame that this is his only film. The film is loosely based on the true events of the life of Rudi van Danzi and it presents the sexual and emotional awakening of a young Dutch boy as he engages in a sexual relationship with a soldier during WWII. Their relationship seems to be a loving one and at times it even appears magical. This causes the question to arise---can a relationship based upon two people with such an age difference actually have validity and integrity or they abusive? The film is sure to cause a ?kick in the stomach? reaction by the majority of people but even with this happening the film is remarkably delicate and beautiful. It no way does it exploit or preach. It is beautifully acted and photographed and the sensitive material is handled with grace and compassion. The film avoids the common pitfalls and because it is so carefully handled it avoids reaching a logical conclusion. The film is a memory which echoes the present time and it is obvious that the film does not consider the relationship to be abusive in any way; the viewer has to make that decision himself. If the movie is viewed with an open mind, those that see it will find that it forces them to define in their own minds what is considered abusive and this is undoubtedly what the film aims to do?the viewer must argue with himself on an issue that is considered largely taboo in the modern world. The film will , without question, be seen by some who will consider it perverted but in reality I found it, although shocking, to be heartwarming and a sympathetic view of youthful homosexuality, There is no mention of child abuse and the love affair between the thirteen young boy is handled sensitively and with great frankness. In fact, it is the young boy who seems to be pursuing the older man. The film is never vulgar or sensational and the actual sexual coupling of the two males is surrounded by sub-plots and there are many references to sexual tensions. The question which remains is whether or not a mere child can have consent ional sex with an adult. There is, of course, the idea that since the soldiers were protecting us and making the world safe that they were allowed to do whatever they wanted. The real problem, as it appears to me, is for most adult males, a love affair of a few days cannot be truly considered as ?love? yet for a child whose innocence is lost forever, and this is an affair that will never be forgotten. Nonetheless, the subject is handled beautifully and with great tenderness. This film is highly recommended as one that will make you think and re-examine yourself and after all, is that not what a really good movie does?_________________Amos Lassen    ",0
"I've listened to this CD probably numbering in the hundreds since its release in 1978.  Each time I do so, it never fails to leave me in wonder.  And I have to ask myself, ""how can it be that by doing something so simple as adding a single vocalist, the entire look, feel, sound, and musicianship of a band so completely change?""  But then I listen to it again, and I find my answer..........the songwriting is flawless, the harmonies tight, the keyboards of Greg Rollie are used in their best form. The guitar of Neil Schon sings, and the vocals that are Steve Perry carry each tune to its fullest.  And for those reasons, ""Infinity"" has rightfully come to be known as one of THE defenitive albums of the 70s.  Later albums like ""Frontiers"" would take them in a new direction by allowing them to rock harder, and ""Escape,"" would find them being catapulted into superstardom with some of the best songs found on any album of the 1980s.Listen to the love that the band has for their home town, San Francisco, in ""Lights.""  From there, ""Feeling That Way,"" tells the story of a life's new love. ""Wheel in the Sky,"" speaks of life on the road, and the trials it brings to the homefront.  ""Winds of March,"" brings to the listener a feeling of a warm evening breeze, and fills our ears with the right blend of piano and guitar. From one song to the next, each song flows smoothly and effortlessly.  This is Journey at their absolute best. It just doesn't get any better than this.  A milestone that qualifies Journey's Infinity to rank in the top 5 as one of the finest albums ever recorded",0

"I was uncertain I'd like this book because I like the unusual, and a story about a ""player"" gay man didn't sound unique. However, I was surprised. It is a strong story with interesting twists and well-hewn character progession.We see Tony Romero's life, that of a casanova who hunts for an O.O.D. (object of desire), bags him, then tires of him once he's feasted enough. His modus operandi is particularly sharp--using artistic ability, flirting, and a carefully calculated system that lands `em every time. But Tony is changing, slowly. He begins to see what it's doing to other people, his wacky family, and himself.It almost seems like a contrivance that Tony has a Mexican grandmother, Danish mother (who got stranded with her mother-in-law), a black brother, Cleve, and Peter, the ""stepfather."" Their house is a mixture of languages, changes, and racing dogs (I can't explain it, you'll just have to read about it!) that's both endearing and funny.Each of Tony's ex's are colorful and different and shed light on how Tony operates and the often-messy results. Particularly interesting is Tom, the bike messenger who rides on the edge of his very raw emotions and has clever methods of revenge. Tom's toothbrush trick is just one of the many inventive, funny surprises that fill this book.While there is the plot of who-shot-Tony, I was only mildly worried about that while I immersed myself in Tony's activities and reflections on his past. This novel is at a higher level of writing than most gay novels today; it's even sort of a shame that the publisher promotes it as a gay romance novel. It's much more than that",1

"This book has a mundane title but could be titled ""Everything you ever wanted to know about project success and then some"".  The Project Management Scorecard focuses on how to evaluate and measure the success of project management solutions.  Given that failed projects are far more common than successful projects, executives are investing more time and money in developing project managers.  This book recognizes the challenges in measuring the return on project management investment and provides clarity and techniques on how to overcome this obstacle.  The book is very thorough in its examination of the problems, process, and solutions to measuring project management success.  First the authors break down the problem into its component parts, then they take a look at the project management process steps, and finally they present multiple approaches on how to create an effective scorecard and to use it to achieve desired results.  The book includes not only straight-forward steps to follow, but also questionnaires and forms that can be easily used.  Success stories and case studies are also included to illustrate major points.  Some of the topics include the following:o Project management issues and challengeso Changing corporate cultureso Measuring reaction and satisfactiono How to calculate and interpret and ROIo Capturing business impact datao Measuring skill and knowledge changes during the projecto Monitoring the true costs of the projecto Converting business measure to monetary valueso Forecasting ROIThis book provides a straight-forward approach to setting up and measuring project success.  The authors have taken an onerous topic and provided clarity through simple techniques that can be easily adopted.  If implemented, the solutions presented should siginificantly contribute to overall organizational success.  ",1

"Characters are pretty numerous but not so many we can't keep up with them.  Clare, the main character is a divorce therapist who lost her husband in a tragic accident.  Dory (short for Isadore) is her best friend; Dory's husband Son Rogers is wealthy and is not Clare's best friend.  Haley is Clare's daughter, whose husband Austin is a real jerk.  Two men are romantically interested in Clare: Lex, a Yankee from Maine who owns a marina; and Rye, who is old Fairhope and a close friend of Clare's dead husband Mack.  Add to this a few honest-to-goodness characters like the bird lady/mother-in-law and her strange old boyfriend Cooter and you have a colorful crowd of believable characters.The plot of the novel belongs to the three women, Clare, Dory, and Haley--their actions, relationships (especially with each other), their reactions move the chain of events in very Southern ways.  Ways, we may know something about:  manipulation, mysteriousness, emotional highs and lows, and amazing courage and sensitivity.This is a wonderful novel whose theme seems to be importance of seeing life as a journey with its crossroads; however, I prefer to think its biggest message is the strength of friendship between women.

"Current scientific understanding of cortisol's role in stress, disease, weight gain and so on is useful general information, even if it doesn't tell specifically how to endure and surmount the stress of modern life.

A few of the many nutritional supplements he recommends -- magnesium, for example, might be mildly helpful for a few people who have bad eating habits and don't take conventional vitamins and minerals.All the other recommendations for nutritional supplements lack scientific foundation. Any author can just make this stuff up. Then another author cites the first author, a third author cites the second, and a fourth author cites the first, in a round robin of nonsense.

Though that was 1991 for me, the story still stayed with me long after I had read many other novels by King, or of the supernatural genre in general.  When I found out The Dead Zone was to be a series on a cable network channel, I was pretty excited.  Not every King story can be made into a ""series"" let alone a successful one, but with Dead Zone, I think everyone who had read the book was excited to see Johnny Smith again.  Brief Outline:  The Dead Zone storyline centered on Johnny Smith, a simple man with a simple name.  A schoolteacher who was on top of the world.  He was engaged to his high school sweetheart and life could not be better.  Suddenly, all of that changed.  Johnny was driving home one night after a date with Sarah when he gets into a terrible car accident.  The result leaves him in a coma for six years.  When Johnny awakens six years later, he finds Sarah has remarried, and that he suddenly has precognitive abilities that are activated when he touches or is touched by another person.  This gift to see the future in fragments allows him to quickly be able to change outcomes that could lead to tragic consequences if otherwise left alone.  In the book, Johnny suddenly comes in contact with the future president named Stillson that will ultimately start a nuclear war.  Johnny must make the ultimate, extreme sacrifice to ensure the safety of mankind's future.Cast and Stories:  Anthony Michael Hall plays Johnny Smith.  Though some may be leery of this because in their minds he'll always be a teen goofball from 80's high school movies, they should give him more credit.  Hall has played various adult roles in popular films.  Whether being cast as famous baseball great Whitey Ford in ""61"" or rags to riches software mogul Bill Gates in ""Pirates of Silicon Valley"", Hall cast as Johnny Smith is superb.  Hall puts a lot of passion and effort into the role, taking on the ability to convey to us via cane, overcoat, and painful revelations of the future that this is not a role that is just for anyone.  He gives Johnny Smith the vibrant and mysterious life he deserves as a man who knows where he's been, but also knows what the future holds.  We feel the anguish over his childhood sweetheart/finance'/love of his life being married to another man, while they raise a son that is biologically his.  We understand the frustration he feels in dealing with the taunting and nay Sayers over his abilities, with the height of it being accused of witchcraft in one particular episode.  Ultimately, we stand not by him, but a ways back, giving him room to show us what he see's in the future, and what steps he must take in order to prevent the disastrous outcome.  It is in this power he holds that also beckons law enforcement to use Johnny in many episodes, which ultimately helps close the uncomfortable riff between him and Sheriff Walt Bannerman, who is now married to Sarah.Nicole Deboer as Sarah Bannerman:  Nicole is perfect in the role.  Her ability to convey to us that she still loves Johnny Smith while balancing the fact that she has moved on with another man is excellent.  If anyone knows the Johnny Smith of now better than anyone, it is the women who knew the Johnny Smith before that fateful car crash.  When she's not raising her son and keeping things together in the home, she's on her cell phone keeping tabs on what Johnny's latest exploits are, precognitive or otherwise.Chris Bruno as Sheriff Bannerman:  Chris does a great job of being a no nonsense law enforcement presence with an intelligent, soft side.  He is wary of Smith and shows a tinge of jealousy when Smith arises from his hospital bed to come back to the living.  As season one progresses, the two form somewhat of a bond as they help each other deal with future tragedies that will happen if they don't act.  Their teamwork together is strong, complete, and concise despite the position they are in involving Sarah and little Johnny.John L. Adams as Bruce Lewis:  Bruce is Johnny Smith's physical therapist and was working at the hospital in Cleaves Mills, Maine that Johnny was admitted at in the state of a coma.  They soon form a strong friendship that is appealing and admirable.  Bruce, in all reality, is Johnny's sidekick, and is often with him when he has visions.  His loyalty is not only appreciated by Johnny, but most of the time is needed as Johnny often finds himself in some pretty dire situations that need a helping hand or a word of advice.David Ogden Stiers as Reverend Purdy:  I don't remember from the original novel of ""the dead zone"" whether this guy existed or not, but that does not matter because I'm explaining the series, and this character has a great fit.  When Johnny comes out of his coma he finds out that his mother has died, and her estate is left to Reverend Purdy, a man Johnny knew as his mothers boyfriend before his accident.  Purdy is a religious man with the best of intentions, though at first appearance it seems he may be up to something.  Johnny isn't totally left out on the street, for Purdy does everything he can to make sure Johnny is set up in his return to the land of the living.Kristen Dalton as Dana Bright:  Dana is a reporter for the local paper and has a keen interest in Johnny Smith.  Her brash approach is often reminiscent of a paparazzi goon that is masked by charm and beauty.  However, we soon will come to find out there is a softer side to Dana as even she realizes that she cannot crack the mystery surrounding Johnny's ""psychic"" abilities.  A vibrant and strong character that adds a lot to an overall strong cast.With a cast like this, the series is more than what we find on network television.  These people come together like a family, and we are drawn in again and again at their lives and the roles they play in ""The Dead Zone"" just as much as we are on the tragedies and triumphs that surround Johnny Smith's second coming.There are four DVD's in this set totaling 13 episodes.  This includes the original Pilot!  Considering the number of episodes (11 plus pilot premiere which counts as episodes one and two) I personally think it's one of the best buys on the market today.  Some shows are fifty to one hundred dollars for a season.  For that money you can enjoy the first two seasons of this fantastic sci-fi suspense show.I won't give itty bitty details of each episode, instead I will cover a few of my favorites in a little more detail to give you a better understanding of the multitude of diverse stories that await you.  The Pilot:  This is the must see of course, as it is the foundation of what leads to ""The Dead Zone"".  The term ""dead zone"" by doctors is what is part of Johnny's brain that is no longer working, but at the same time may hold the very secrets of his new abilities.  The pilot shows Johnny in his teaching years and his romance with Sarah, leading up to the car crash that put him in a coma.  His coming out of it six years later quickly shows us his powers as he grabs a nurses arm only to suddenly see that her house at home is soon to be on fire and her little girls life is in danger.  He see's Sarah for the first time since coming out of the coma only to find out she's married.  The emotional toll it takes on both of them comes through very clear.  The pilot disc also has some great behind the scenes footage in special features as we have interviews with the director and actors.Episode 5:  Netherworld:  Johnny has a vision of a fiery explosion at a mall he and Bruce are at.  As he slips in and out of consciousness, he finds himself in two worlds, and one is the one he would have had if the accident had not happened.  He tries to tell his wife Sarah that they are not real and he is running out of time to find the answers to what is behind the explosion, he is forced to choose between the two worlds and wonders if he can have the best of both:  Saving lives while getting his old one back.Episode 10:  Here there be monsters:  One of my favorites to this day.  Johnny and Bruce end up in a small New England town where a mother and her daughter have been murdered.  Johnny offers to help find where the other missing daughter is but his efforts are soon looked at as witchcraft, and he is charged with such.  An intense scene unfolds as Bruce tries to flee town only to be run down by local ""witch hunters"" who quickly take him off to the woods.  Johnny starts to find out where the little girl is but his clues fall on deaf ears as ignorance and hate soon envelope him and Bruce, which leads to a showdown in the woods.  Who will be the sacrifice this time?Episode 12:  Shaman:  Johnny has a vision of a fiery meteor that plunges to Earth.  His initial warnings fall on deaf ears, as a local Astronomer cannot see anything coming from the skies.  Desperate to find more answers so he can give the proper information of its trajectory, he heads for the mountains to find the specific one he saw in his vision.  Falling and having a broken leg, he takes up in a cave where he soon meets someone.  Time-Space conundrums go wild as Johnny communicates with a Shaman who he soon finds out knows more about him than he realizes.  Across time the two must save their people or the outcomes will alter everyone's life forever.The final episode is fun as we are introduced to a familiar face...that of a man named Stillson who just happens to be rising through the political ranks.  The season finale has some great retrospective scenes and also has some major happenings with him and Sarah that will lead me eager to see what happens in season 2!The Dead Zone has a strong cast of supporting characters and a great lead character in Anthony Michael Hall.  The cinematic backdrop of the rainy, forested town in Maine with it's hometown charm and community appeal is perfect.  The stories are well written as they introduce not just a paranormal approach but add a lot of mystery and intrigue that is topped off with varying themes that touch on the very things we see and experience in society today.  Some people in Cleaves Mills call Johnny Smith a nut, a Satanist, or what have you.  After watching ""The Dead Zone"", you'll realize that although it's impossible to change fate his way, the people in this town ultimately still sleep easier at night knowing he's there.",0
"This was a great show I do not know why they didn't make more episodes. But, this is a awesome DVD although I do suggest you watch the show first weekdays at 11:00 on channel 42 Pacific Time. My favorite episode is ""Day Of A Jackass"" which is one you should check out",0

"I had to purchase this book for a Class I was taking at Sam Houston State University.  It is an excellent book to help learn problem solving strategies.  Although, I am an elementary education major with a math specialization and had to take this class, I would recommend this book to anyone who is planning to teach grades 1 through 12.  This book was designed for middle school grades, but could be adapted to any grade level.  Problem solving is so important in mathematics",1
"...the first half of the book can be summarized as an argument that thinking about what you read will help you understand it better and thinking before you write will help you write better...I doubt anyone would argue with that...in the process they attempt to introduce various aspects of thinking that may help...most of the concepts, however, probably are ones with which you're already familiar...not surprisingly they manage to plug their other books, their website and their training seminars every few pages or so...and like many similar ""pop"" psychology type books there are many ""anecdotes"" of various indivdual successes they've had...the last half of the book is devoted to various ""verbal intelligence activities""...unfortunately the activities are presented only in the most general fashion...for example, ""Guess What"" is nothing more than a guessing game where the teacher is supposed to provide clues to the pupil as to an object the teacher has in mind...no specifics as to what sorts of items and what sorts of clues would be best or most interesting -- it's up to the teacher to figure out should be chosen and how the clues should be presented...and this is the case in every activity...I don't know but if the teacher happens to be your average parent I seriously doubt they will possess either the time, energy or initiative necessary to come up with all the ideas required for the activities...moreover, I doubt that many would have sufficient training to know what ideas would be appropriate for a given age group, what ideas would be most interesting to a given age age group, etc...also, frankly, most of the activities presented seem quite boring...for example, one activity involves the teacher providing two words (e.g. cramp, lagoon) which the pupil is to use in a sentence...I just don't believe many kids would rise to the occasion for that sort of challenge...in summary, I seriously doubt anyone will find this book to be very useful -- either theoretically or practically",1
"Oh my goodness!! This is an incredible ground-breaking book of awareness and consciousness. It was a must-read for anyone coming of age in the 1980's and it is still relevant today.

The paperback is selling on ZBooks for $45. I'm confounded",1

"The authors of Blogging for Business, Shel Holtz and Ted Demopoulous, did an excellent job of standardizing the process of blogging and creating a book that I'd like to refer to as a `blogging bible' for anyone participating in the blogging experience.  As the buzz about blogging has taken off, Holtz and Demopoulous do a great job of simplifying the entire blogging process.  In fact the subhead for their book is a great summary - ""Everything you need to know and why you should care.""  I'm glad this is the first book I read on the subject of blogging because Holtz and Demopoulous did a wonderful job of describing the business benefits of why blogging should be on your radar screen.  The first couple chapters of the book cover the blogging basics that anyone interested (or knowledgeable for that matter) in blogging should understand before getting into the benefits.In a way the book serves as an instruction manual about how to set up a blog as they go into nice detail about the various services and functions available.  I was able to set up my personal blog by following chapter 8, ""How to create a blog - step-by-step.""  As I mentioned earlier, this is definitely a book that I've referred back to as I encounter anything new or confusing this blogging world that we're in.Three of the last four chapters focused on the topic of promoting and measuring the results of your blog.  Based on personal experience with blogs, I would focus most of your time reading and re-reading these chapters.  As Holtz and Demopoulous mention throughout the book, the biggest challenge of blogging is getting noticed by others by understanding the `behind the scenes' process for promoting your blog.Blogs, podcasts, vlogs (video blog) and other forms of `new media' are definitely worth consideration - especially from a business perspective.  Blogging for Business is a great starting point for anyone interested or curious to learn more about this new influential world.  ",1
"We the people of the United States like to think of ourselves as peace loving icons, holding ourselves up above the petty problems that affect the rest of the world. And there is a certain amount of truth to that. On the other hand, consider Sweden and Switzerland who haven't been in any wars for several centuries. The conclusion has to be that the United States has a fairly war-like culture. This book is written from the standpoint of looking at the present war in Iraq. His thesis is that this is not the first time we instituted a regime change. He starts with an analysis of what he calls our first first one, the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893. (Being a Yankee he forgets the one about twenty years before that, but we Confederates remember.). I believe that the only redeeming grace we can offer is that in general the regime changes we have instituted have not been nearly as bad as say the Germans in Poland, the British in Zululand. While we've had incidents such as the one in My Lai, it was nothing like the Japanese Rape of Nanking. Indeed, in places such as the Phillipines, Germany and Japan we've fairly rapidly pulled out.",1

"This was the first Wilber book I picked up.  As someone who works a computer job and has pretty much become completely sucked into a culture of partitions, I found this book both intellectually provoking as well as a tool for healing the many rifts within myself.The explanation of the ""centaur"" concept - the unification of horse/rider (body/mind)- was incredibly helpful.  I especially enjoyed the further reading sections that make it easy to do deeper research on the areas that the reader finds most compelling.Keep an eye out for the Witness meditation/pathworking.  It's excellent and has been added to my daily pre-meditation regime.Excellent, excellent early Wilber",1

"My favorite short story is Michael McDowell's ""Halley's Passing,"" about a serial killer who is so much more than he appears to be. Perhaps better known for his screenplays, McDowell was a masterful author of horror novels in the gothic tradition, including his Blackwater series, which stands collectively as a classic of the genre. He passed away in 1999, leaving behind an unfinished manuscript for CANDLES BURNING, which was to have been his penultimate novel.Tabitha King, wife of Stephen King, is the author of a number of novels as well. The publication of this book occurs as the result of King's relationship with the McDowell family. She was given McDowell's manuscript and asked to complete the work. King is quite up front about what the novel is --- and what it's not. It is not, she tells us, the story that McDowell set out to write. This will disappoint some. What we have here though is a tale infused with southern gothic tradition and strategic strands of horror interwoven into the foundation of its tapestry.It is said that every Southern family of means has a streak of madness that runs deep and long through it; CANDLES BURNING takes that truism and runs. Here, the family of means is the Carroll family, whose lineage intersects with the ""no-account"" Dakins family when Roberta Ann Carroll marries Joe Cane Dakin. There is a method to her madness; Joe Cane is one of the richest men in 1950s Alabama, the owner of a string of highly successful Ford auto dealerships. It is Dakin's success that indirectly leads to his downfall. Accompanied by his wife and their two children, Calley and Ford, Dakin attends an auto dealers' convention in New Orleans and is murdered in gruesome fashion. The family quickly finds itself bereft and destitute, none more so than Calley, who was her father's favorite even as her mother seems constantly to resent her.After leaving Ford with her own mother, Roberta takes Calley to reside in an enigmatic resort home on Pensacola Beach, one with ties to Calley's past and heritage. King's prose and pacing are first rate; one is transported to a time and place that no longer exist --- the south of the mid-20th century --- while insanity dances in the shadows just out of sight. While CANDLES BURNING deals on the surface with Calley's coming of age, there is more than adolescent turbulence roiling in her heart. The truth about all --- Dakin's death, Calley's birthright --- is revealed in the end, with some help from an unexpected source. But it is King's triptych, as opposed to the final destination, that makes this book worth reading.Ultimately CANDLES BURNING is somewhat reminiscent of Peter Straub's earlier work. The focus is not on horror, or even necessarily the supernatural, though some of the latter is present. The characterization is sharp, and more importantly, when you finish the book you truly will miss Calley --- so much so that you may well read this finely crafted work again and again.   --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub",1

"Some books you forget as soon as you set down. Not this one.I never liked Robert Cormier when I was younger. I thought he was bitter, depressing and pointless--much like another reviewer who gave this book a one star rating. Now that I am more mature I realize he may be bitter and depressing but he is definately not pointless.I guess you can see this book as just a story about a kid who gets beat up for not selling chacolates. You can also see Animal Farm as a cute little story about farm animals. However, you can also see ""The Chocolate War"" as a compelling demonstration of human sadism and the tendancy toward collective violence and nationalism. It all depends on how deeply you look.",1
"I'm an avid cook book collector. I tend to look for the ones that stand out from the rest... the ones that have a bit more in them then just recipies. This is definitley one of those books. If I could, I'd give it 10 stars.The book is filled with wonderful little recipes that everyone should have. They aren't spectacular. They aren't professional grade. They aren't the kind of recipe that it will take 2 weeks to locate the ingredients and another 6 hours to create the dessert. But that is exactly what seredipity is all about. If you know anything about the actual store/shop/restaurant...they never were into the harder-then-heck kind of recipes. They took simple things, and gave them a style all their own. And all of New York...and eventually the rest of the world...loved it!The recipes are definitley ""yummy."" Every single one. The pictures are to die for. Every single one. :) I brought this book to work and had a 1/2 a dozen people ask me when i was making ""this"" or when I was making ""that""...then they'd point to a picture and drool. :)....but as I began with, this book has more than just recipies in it. It has seredipity's history....written by one of the owners himself. A very interesting read. And it's not just a 1/2 of a page long. It's lengthy. The book is worth it's price just for this read. On almost every page there is a 'snippit' or 'story' from Serendipities history. Feel good stories. Hollywood-siting stories. Stories that will make you want to go to the actual location if you have never been there. Did you know that Robin Williams brough a little girl who was dying of a life-threatening disease to Serendipity...treated her to lunch....and kept her laughing for hours on end? This book tells you things like that.  Did you know that the owners wouldn't even give the recipe of Frozzzen Hot Chocolate to the First Lady? The book tells you that story too.And,yes .....the book does include the infamous 'Frozzzen Hot Chocolate' recipe that they have become famous for. No, it doesn't tell you exactly what kind of chocolate they use (they'd go out of business if they gave it up!)....but it gives you a start. Use your own chocoalte kind-of recipe. It also includes variations of the hot-chocoalte recipe. Very fun.If you are a cook cook collector this book is a must for your shelf. Put it right next to your entertaining books from Williams-Sonoma. :) If you have a friend that is a collector and you are trying to find a book that will stand out from all of the other ones that they own......Stop looking...THIS IS IT! I promise! :",1
"This book is an eye-opener!  Jon Dougherty is one of America's outstanding investigative journalists.  His penetrating research and front-line reporting go far beyond the spin and political &quot;new speak&quot; of talking-heads and crass politicians pandering for votes.  Dougherty looks at the realities of America's failed immigration policy.  He describes the daily acts of terrorism commited by illegals.  He details the criminal activity by illegal aliens, drug-smugglers, and corrupt elements of the Mexican army who provide armed support.  He reveals how armed incursions by Mexican military and police have resulted in violent exchanges with U.S. authorities.  Incredibly the media have suppressed reporting such events.  He details the trashing of property and victimizing of American citizens living on the border that is ignored by a media motivated more by editorial politics rather than accurate reporting.  This book is a must read on one of the most urgent topics facing America today",1

I haven't read the way I use to in a long time but reading Jonathan Livingston Seagull has brought me back to the beautiful world of literature. It's very easy to read and doesn't even take long to finish but the mark it leaves on your mind will never go away. It's a story that will actually make you feel safer about life itself and confident in whatever you're pursuing. This story could change someone's life around and make them believe what's impossible can be possible. If your in a situation where you feel everyone is against you this book will show that even though they're not with you there may be people out there like you but they're just waiting for someone to step up. This is truly a story that everyone should read and with all of the stories schools force on kids why isn't Jonathan Livingston Seagull one of them,1

"Metalcore?  Hardcore?  I don't know.  I hate labels.  All i know is that this is one killer heavy album.  My roots are in Metallica, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Judas Priest, Death, Megadeth, Pantera... and so on.  Everyone is trying to slap labels on Metal... I like all metal by whatever name.  I like cheesey Powermetal bands like Hammerfall and Dragonforce and heavy bands like Sepultura and Obituary.  These guys (Chimaira) rock.  They deliver a bone crushing sound that is mature and structured.  The riffs pound your skull as the vocals kick you in the nuts.  Sure the lead singer sounds interchangeable with, say, Trivium or As I Lay Dying, but isn't that the genre?  That's like saying Hammerfall's vocals are too similar to Sonata Arctica's.  These guys are great.  This album is great metal.  Every track is super awsome and none dissapoint.  It is a little different then their earlier releases, like The Impossibility of Reason, but that's what good bands do, they mature and change.  Compare Metallica's Kill 'Em All to ...And Justice for All, or Megadeth's Peace Sells to Rust in Peace.  Change.  Saying the band sold out on this album is just F-ing stupid... do you hear any radio friendly songs?  No. You Don't.  And you won't ever from this band, until radio wises up and puts some Metal stations out there.  Buy this album if you like Metal, go to hell if you don't like metal.",0
"Lets face it - no one wants to sit through 5 minutes of comercials on BBC just to see two scenes of a show and then more comercials!That's why it's so great that two (or maybe three) of the best actor(Patrick McGoohan!)'s best shows (this and the Prisoner) are now on DVD!  No comercials! No BBC! And all the episodes are in order!  (Or, as w/the Prisoner, as close to it as possible)And of course John Drake is better than Bond! Just in case you have to ask why, I'll tell you: because McGoohan was a good Catholic spy (or as close to it as possible)!!With the half-hour 'Danger Man' show, you were left wondering how anyone could mistake Drake for No. 6.  I mean, the first season's character was too down to earth to get mixed up in all that trouble.After watching the 'new' Drake, however, I am personally left with no doubt about whether or not he is going to the Village.Even if you havn't seen the Prisoner (or are just unmutual), Danger Man/Secret Agent Man is a great show!!PS - the 'Secret Agent' mega set (the multi-colored, really big one) contains different seasons than the 'Danger Man' mega set (the five-volume, orange one",0

He has reawakened a consciousness in all people that portrays the fact that we must take a stand for something or we will fall for anything.  In every  way we must continue to encourage each other to rise, take action and make  a difference, which is what advocacy is all about anyway.  Tavis gives us  the inspiration to do just that.  Thanks Tavis for the uplifting words that  will bring us out of complacency and into ACTION",1
"Many people like to pick up a book, read a couple of pages, and think about it. While upholding all of the wonderful things said in previous reviews, I would also like to add that this book is perfect for those who enjoy short readings.  All of the major doctrines of the Christian faith are summarized and excellently presented in small chapters or sections of just a few pages.  I went through this book in about a year and fully enjoyed it. In my opinion this book treats much of the same material found in &quot;Knowing God&quot; but in a more didactic, outlined manner.  It is also a great quick reference of cardinal doctrinal points.  It is condensed truth",1
"Knuff respect to Public Enemy, they are one of the few groups in Hip-Hop history who've provided fans with ill beats and consciouss lyrics.  With that said, this single blows.  It's trash.  The beats are trash, Chuck D and Flavor Flav don't rap, the DVD is just them hanging out in some clubs.  It's a shame, legends such as Public Enemy are far above this remedial single.  If you want to hear their best worx, go and buy Fear of a Black Planet, or It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back.  You won't be dissapointed..",0
"This album rules so much,  For the uninitiated this is a drone/doom metal album, it has no drums, vocals sometimes, but mostly just huge dark guitars feeding back.  It is terrifying, I described to a friend as sounding like ""Satan bleeding to death inside of a volcano,"" if that sounds at all interesting to you BUY THIS ALBUM!!",0
"What do you get when you mix global warming, an artificial intelligence named Gea (instead of Gaia), German idealist Friedrich Schelling, Catholic mystic Teilhard de Chardin, Russian Orthodox mystic philosopher Nikolai Federov, and a guilt-ridden far-future post-human networked mind in need of atonement?  Apparently, you get reams of turgid telling-not-showing exposition followed by soporific sermons about how humans can transcend themselves to become gods (or, as in the case of the net-mind Transcendence, a sort of Godnet 2.0).  Perhaps the soul of this book is the Catholic Priest character, Rosa (of course the Vatican has lightened up on that male Priest thing), who tells us Federov drew on ""Marxist historical determinism, socialist utopianism, and deeper wells of Slavic theology and nationalism to come up with a 'Cosmism,' which preached an ultimate unity between man and the universe.""  As you can see, Rosa has the soul of a GRE question writer on a bender at the Burning Man festival.I love a rip-roaring space opera.  I also love mind-bending far-future speculation.  Unfortunately, this book is neither rip-roaring nor mind-bending.  Take a pass",1
"Talyn is a novel that will haunt me long after I've finished it.  It contains all the right elements of a fully engrossing read: excellent world-building, vivacious characterizations, and a well-paced, complex plot.The novel's world is vivid and finely developed.  There are no medieval European cliches here; Korre is a world very much of its own and unlike anything I've read before.  Talyn's love of her homeland enriched the descriptions that may have been bland and overkill if told in third person.  Instead, they are fully immersive.Talyn's narration is poignant and engaging.  The scenes in third person add much to the story, as well.  It was sometimes jarring switching between the two, but such changes were infrequent enough that they did not become distracting.  The characters were vivid and finely developed, especially the villain, who was sympathetic enough to be very frightening.Talyn is a very well-plotted novel that keeps growing on itself as conflicts get bigger and more complex.  The novel is not without its share of plot twists and surprises.  In all, Talyn is epic fantasy at its finest",1
"We finally get more Seger on a greatest hits C.D. Most of these songs are his lesser known hits, with a couple of exceptions. I'm not nearly as famliar with these songs, so no individual reviews on these. Songs like Understanding, Katmandu, Her Strut, Sunspot Baby, Fire Lake, and Rock And Roll Never Forgets have never gotten their due. They're all great songs by a great artist and it's just so nice to see them on one C.D.Also included on this are The Fire Down Below, Beautiful Loser, Shame On The Moon, Shakedown(From Beverly Hills Cop II), and more. This includes a duet with Martina Mcbride ""Chances are"" from the movie Hope Floats. He includes three new previously unreleased songs. The previously mentioned Shakedown which was originally on the soundtrack from the Eddie Murphy vehicle, Chances Are, and Understanding. Seger, like I said in my review of the first greatest hits, sings songs that move you. He's written a lot of songs that many people can symbolize with. American hits from a Michigan artist. People seem to under-appreciate Seger. That is a shame. HE's a great artist with a great sound. Great music, lyrics, and messages. Just sit back and listen to his music and you will not be disappointed. Well worth the money. Don't listen to the nay-sayers. Get IT",0
"This is the last Honor Harrington book I'll read. The first 300 pages have NO STORY. Nothing happens until the last three chapters, and then it's predictable and uninteresting. This book was a complete waste of my time and money, except that it really did solve my insomnia a few times (and I'm serious--I fell asleep EVERY TIME I tried to read it).Book One was good despite the long, ponderous history lessons and techno/military exposition. Honor and her fellow characters were interesting and the action was intense.Book Two was amazing, a great read without the flaws of the first book. I was surprised to get so emotionally involved, and some of the climactic scenes are among the finest I've ever read in science fiction. From first page to last, it was an exciting, interesting, fun, emotional read, and well worth the money and time.Then we get this drivel, the ""Dull Ponderous War.""  I wish I could get my money back, but more importantly I wish I could get my time back.This book ended my interest in Honor Harrington and in David Weber.",1

"A member of the Petersburg elite himself, Count Leo Tolstoy had mastered the polish and sophistication at 18 that most around him had still not mastered later on in his life, when he had excluded himself from their buzzing circuit. It isn't any wonder that he was already focused on spirituality at a time when some of his more fashionable contemporaries were espousing a near-totalitarian socialist-geared egalitarianism. Tolstoy the spiritual revolutionary consumed Tolstoy's later life. Tolstoy the artist must have been in a groove all his own when writing War and Peace.The entire 1000+ page novel, while examining the principles of war and of peace separately and alternately, comes to spiral around a particular unlikely star-crossed couple. Awkward, red faced and obese, more wallflower than party favorite, more saint than brave soldier, that Pierre warrants the notice of the precocious charmer, Natasha, at all is a miracle in itself. More precocious than wise, Natasha has too many choices open to her. She is the dazzling flower in the room that every bee is surruptitiously eyeing, all but Pierre, that is. And this becomes a peripheral sign that he is the more deserving of her in the end. Having met my own Natasha some years ago, Pierre and Natasha's strange central developing story, amidst all the life of 19th Century Russia, hit home for me. Feminazis and other Marxist-influenced theorists have often branded Tolstoy as a sexist and anti-progress for choosing and espousing the early Greek-inspired Christian spirit and Christian values of his conscience, rather than embracing the fashioable socialist views of a Turgenev, et. al. Some have even accused him of being reactionary and conservative. Tolstoy was a maverick and a social reformer of some weight. He took on the Russian Othodox Church and the elite of society and told them what he thought of them. Ghandi read his THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN while sitting in a colonial British prison before going on to eventually win India's freedom from colonial Britain, rendering the modern Britain a moral inferior by the end of the ordeal. Turgenev never impacted the modern world in an even remotely significant way compared to this feat. Feminism has not impacted sufferage for women, nor does it impact contemporary culture. Tolstoy: 1, Socialist/Marxist-Feminist fanatics: 0. Tolstoy worked to make equality a reality for Russian peasants by writing serious essays that examined the nobility and values adhered to by peasants, and contrasting them to debauchery and self-destructive tendencies of the culture of the elites of his day and circle. I can't say that Tolstoy's values are always my values. But he understood Christianity better than most Christians before or after him ever did or ever will. He recognized Buddhism as being essentially Christian in HIS sense of Christinaity. He abored idol-worship, in the sense of reality wearing the masks we assign to it, to our own detriment and ultimate undoing.The sweeping, masterful narrative powers of Tolstoy come through in many of his books and short stories, but War and Peace is his ultimate masterpiece because it contains so much, and still coheres in the priciples that seem to self-materialize for us as they did for Tolstoy. One of the best ""philosophical"" fiction I have probably ever read, right up with Journey to the End of the Night and Dostoyevsky's best works",1

"Du Maurier is the author of almost twenty novels, articles, plays, memoirs and short stories; yet is known for a relatively limited handful of popular works.

The result is a revealing, absorbing study",1

Plenty of books have been written on French cuisine and history; but JeanRobert Pitte's French Gastronomy is different. It is about the study of French cuisine: the history and geography of a passion for French cooking. Individual chapters link the mystique of food and eating in France to a sense of place and microregions that allow for different agricultural results. French Gastronomy is an intriguing history and very highly recommended for avid French popular culture and culinary enthusiasts,1
"I've read all three of Ilene's books. Each one has prompted laughter and tears.

"I had to face it that I wasn't making my protein shakes because it was way too messy having to clean up both the large mixing bowl on my blender and the smoothie glass everytime I wanted a quick fix.I also tended to make TOO much of the beverages.  With a 16oz tumbler, you get portion and calorie control on things like fruit smoothies.  I often make way too much when I use my Oster blender, and end up either throwing stuff out or taking in too many calories or too much sugar.You fill the cup with the ingredients you want.  Screw on the cap.  Pulse to break the ice, then lock it in to blend.  When the cup is removed, you unscrew the lid and can drink directly out of the cup.  You wash the cup.  Finished.Most people learn about making smoothies by watching people at juice shops make super large portions they pour into superlarge cups made in super large blenders.  No wonder we think we have to do it the same way at home.You are NOT Jamba Juice.  There are way too many calories and too much sugar in the average juice bar smoothy.Take some control over the time, effort and quality of your smoothies, protein drinks etc and buy this blender!The little cups and alternate blade have proven well mincing onions and garlic.  This little wonder also serves as a very efficient 1 or 2 cup mini food processor as well.I am impressed with some of the other products this company Tribest offers.  Their juicers are designed to squeeze juice out of fruits and vegetables efficiently and at low temperatures to preserve live enzymes for better nutrition.  The fact that HOW you juice something would matter had never occured to me.I believe there is a lot of thinking and care behind their products",0

"Billy Joel has had a long and storied career as a singer.  His style has morphed as his life has.  This compilation of his hits spanning over 2 decades is both a tribute to his longevity and style of music.  Listening to these songs gives you a great appreciation of how this style changed.  From the catchy lyrics to the soulful ballads, this collection has it all.  It's easy to just put a CD in the changer and get lost in the melodies that you grew up listening to.  The quality of the sound from this collection is first-rate.  If you are looking to follow along as a singer/songwriter matures, this is a great way to do it",0
" This is a 'must have' book for the collector of American composition dolls. It is well researched and showcases many smaller companies that produced dolls as beautiful, and desirable, as the larger ,better known manufacturers. The addition of actual advertisements from trade magazines, touting 'uniqueness' and sales potential for particular dolls, is both interesting and education to the serious collector as well as the novice. The histories of the lesser known companies ,no matter how short, are enlightening since many of them I knew nothing about. This volume is as beautifully photographed as the first; Ms. Mertz took no shortcuts on quality. Both volumes I & II are well worth their price.    ",1
"Rarely does one come across a book written in a manner easily understandable and explaining the secret of the universe.  It is easy to talk about a book, but difficult to talk about what a book is about.  Nevertheless, for those on the path with diligence and fortitude the secret can be obtained.  The path is illuminated not by one who points the way and says go get it, but by one who is there and says come here.  I have read a few other books on the subject and whilst other authors become hazy or pontificate, giving me the impression of at best second hand knowledge and not true understanding, Sifu Kit makes it all seem so self-evident.  As a man with true understanding, Kit approaches the subject from several directions allowing the reader to chose the path he is most comfortable with.  He explains that in many cases help may be required in the form of a master, but the secret is waiting.  I look foreward to our meeting",1
"This book is an accessible, sincere and inspired guide for anyone who is curious about how to recover the human's innate ability to be in communication with the non-human world - which apparently just awaits our intention to do so.  Eliot Cowan shares his own fascinating journey of discovery in a way that also offers to the reader ideas for how to do the same.  His message is not, ""look at me, I have special abilities,"" but ""look into yourself and see what is there just waiting to be revived.""  The disastrous psychological, ecological and spiritual situation humans find themselves in as a result of having stopped engaging in ""the great conversation"" with nature, as author Thomas Berry puts it, can begin to heal if we try hard, now, to apply ourselves to the wisdom available in such books as Plant Spirit Medicine.  We have a responsibility to read and utilize such information as Eliot Cowan makes available here.  --Tayria Ward, Ph.D",1
"  Youth is quite an album indeed. Certainly one of their best in my opinion, yet I would say that I also found Blender to be superb. In fact this is one of those rare bands that seem to putout pretty much all good stuff...the track Feels Like- What I Likeis no exception. For one thing if a person expects speed metalthen by all means buy records from speed metal bands but it seemsthat some reviews have dogged the latest Collective Soul cds being glossy. I'd answer to that this way...they seem to incorporate a few new things to the sound on every cd they put out, it's called experimentation. In the end the main portion of sound is about the guitar. The fact that they have incorporated other sounds as well shows me they are adept at utilizing what is available today to engineer something different from just purely guitar in standalone raw forms - there are plenty of bands that do this and that's all many do. I like the hard edge many of their songs have as well as slower more reflective tracks. Ed seems to write both very well. In fact this band has been my favorite since '95.To see exactly how much the sound has changed maybe checking outEd E Roland's self titled Lp is a good idea. The original""Over Tokyo"" is on there, and actually is a great song, among others. I bought a copy of Youth in November of '04 when it came out and I still listen to it regularly, I can't say that about many other cds I've gotten",0
"Stern has offered the most complete understanding of the Cuban missile crisis, and of Kennedy himself, in this the most intimate account of those October days, drawn directly from the taped deliberations.  His reconstruction destroys the simplistic characterizations of JFK as a &quot;cold warrior&quot; and leaves the reader grateful for his handling of that showdown with the Soviets.  I would consider this account more definitive than any other now available, or likely to be in the near future.  This is essential reading",1
"I'll say it again: This is one of the greatest adventure/romance epics ever made -- and I don't use those terms lightly. Harry Faversham (John Clements), whose family wore its military tradition as its badge of honor, resigns his commission when his regiment is sent to Egypt to help win back the Sudan under Kitchener. His three best friends, who were fellow officers, and his fiance, Ethne Burroughs (June Duprez), give him white feathers as a mark of cowardice. He is determined to prove them wrong, goes to the Sudan on his own, and redeems himself in rousing adventures.Particularly good is Ralph Richardson as Captain John Durrance, one of the three friends, who had silently been in love with Ethne Burroughs. Blinded by sunstroke and left for dead after an attack on his detachment by part of the Mahdi's Army, Durrance is rescued by a native peasant whom he cannot see and who will not speak. The peasant, of course, is Harry Faversham. Later in England, he faces a terrible dilemma with only one honorable choice. Richardson brings so much skill to the part of Durrance, whether the brisk and optimistic epitome of an upper-class officer or as a man in love doing the right thing, that he almost steals the movie.  The sweeping photography of the Nile and Egypt is first-rate, and the battle scenes are big and wide. The romance is understated and noble. And there is some sly, good-natured humor aimed by the Kordas at British traditions. The movie is more than 65 years old and is as fresh and exciting as it was when it first came out. It was filmed in Technicolor; the colors are rich and vibrant. It features a great score by Miklos Rozsa.This is one of those excellent movies that make you wonder why anyone would attempt a remake.Incidentally, June Duprez starred the next year in another great adventure, The Thief of Bagdad. It's as worth purchasing as Four Feathers",0

"This might be my favorite Coltrane record.  The disc adds one song not on the lp--Vilia from the operetta ""The Merry Widow.""  I really like it all-especially ""I Want To Talk About You"" and ""Afro-Blue.""Afro Blue is wonderful because Coltrane plays a short introduction and then the rhythm section builds up tension as their playing continues to get more and more intense.  Tyner and Jones are wildmen.  Then Coltrane rips and tears his way through and soars over the top of the rhythm section for a marvelous cresciendo.  The music still stays within some invisible boundary so that listeners turned off by ""free jazz"" are still satisfied.When I was in college and we had stereo wars, I remember playing this song incredibly loud with Elvin Jones beating those drums as if his life depended on it.  My neighbor, Fat Freddie, was simply playing some forgettable rock song trying to defend against the John Coltrane Qt.  It was a lost cause.Raw power on the hoof.  This recording should not be missed.",0

This is a fascinating exploration of the creative process.

"X made four brilliant albums on the trot. not many cared. this film captures them in their prime. for fans like myself who came to their music long after and who will never get to see them live- this  DVD is a great keepsake. forget all that goes through your mind when you think 'music documentary'. this starts with a fictional conceit, goes into a live performance, then voiceovers and informal interviews, and finally edits of montages of newsreels adverts etc. All four strands brilliantly edited together back and forth and sure to bear repeated viewings. No extras though (probably because there was no band input on this release)and over way too quickly. Well, hopefully there may be a better edition years down the line, but get this before it becomes out of print. Just beautiful",0

"Others have drawn attention to Hertzberg's civil tone. We have all become accustomed to discourse via amplified insult; measured voices such as Hertzberg's are refreshing indeed. Having said this, it amounts to nothing more than a shame. When a leftist advances his argument with the typical manic lunacy, we may simply dismiss him as a fool. Hertzberg, however, cannot be so dismissed. He is bright and learned. Unfortunately, he's got it all wrong. All the facts are on the table, and the judge appears to be fair. Yet the judgment is random and chaotic - the judge has added it up as if following a different arithmetic altogether. After reading Hertzberg's work, one has the queasy feeling one gets watching news coverage of the person dragged off to the asylum, leaving puzzled neighbors in his wake saying ""he seemed so normal."" Something's gone wrong, and no one can quite figure out how it happened. A shame, indeed",1

However, I've become very interested in the 1800's since reading a few Darwin biographis so I picked this book up on a whim to take on a trip. I am more than halfway through reading it and am fascinated with the political and cultural situation in France in the mid 19th century and how it influence the artists who became known as the impressionists.  If you enjoy history at all, and if you particularly enjoy books that give you a complete cultural picture of historical events you will like this.

"     Kathy Acker's irresolvable discomfort did not lead to knowledge or even much of a perspective. Peter Wollen quotes from her, ""The only reaction against an unbearable society is equally unbearable nonsense."" Acker's discomfort was a kind, a species, of energy and passion which attracted a sizable, loyal following. The eight essays by teachers and writers take up her literary, artistic style, her persona, and her treatment of politics, gender, sexuality, and other issues of her day. She died of cancer in 2002 shortly after turning fifty. ""In order to make scandal felt continually, Acker finds ways to overflow the bounds of the literary by combining the knowledge she gives us of her life with aggression, humor, unfairness and shifts in direction and context."" She was a prototypical postmodern writer, and there was little difference between her activism and her writing. The essays define and analyze this singular author-activist's style of provocation and education while also linking her to broader artistic, philosophical, and cultural ideas and influences",1

"Microsoft Project receives a lot of unfair criticism from dilletantes that expect it to be as easy to use as Microsoft Word. When they try to use the application without knowing the ""whys and wherefores"", they get frustrated, and act like the poor workman in blaming their tools rather than acknowledging their own lack of skill. Help is at hand. This book is a top-notch effort that sets out best practices to make the most effective use of Microsoft Project. The author does not tediously enumerate every last feature. Instead, he lays out a sequence of best practices, chapter by chapter in chronological order, to use the tool. End of chapter summaries and exercises allow one to gain practical familiarity with using the tool. I would rate this publication better than Microsoft's own books on Microsoft Project. What I like is that the entire book was written by _one_ author. Thus, there is a certain consistency of opinion from chapter to chapter. This becomes obvious compared to the other popular Microsoft Project tome, which, depending upon the edition, has close to a dozen co-authors. The author's style of writing is a little more verbose than one would expect, but it lends a certain charm and continental color to otherwise dry proceedings. However the typesetting of the book and the choice of fonts could have been better -- it reads like a printed and bound training manual. To summarize, overlook the typesetting and buy the book. It is a great book for Microsoft Project users of all skill levels (not just for the rank beginner, but the professional as well).",1

If your hips don't start to rocking, and your love doesn't start to rise up in your throat, then you are in a coma.  Passion and desire are unbridled in this gorgeous track. If you pine for a lost love, I don't suggest you listen to this cd, because you will only intensify your pain.  She speaks your pain in every note, because she has felt its intensity herself.  Lady T is colorless.  Although she said on American Bandstand in the 80's that she was the ""White Queen of Soul"", I beg to differ. I like to call her ""Angel of Soul"", because she rises above and beyond this world with her ethereal voice and emotion.  While Aretha Franklin is grounded in rock steady solid emotion, Teena Marie takes you to flight with her expressions. ",0

"I find it disheartening that so many of King's masterpieces were treated so badly in their film adaptations...and perhaps it's mostly because his books are too complex to adapt well to film...I'm not sure. Delores Claiborne, Stand By Me, Misery, Carrie, Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, and the Green Mile all did well. Then we are treated to stinkers like IT, Maximum Over-drive, Dreamcatchers, Thinner, The Running Man, Firestarter...and of course, this one. Did I forget to mention Stephen King's own remake of The Shining? He should have settled for the original. This film has all the feel of a made-for-tv movie or direct-to-video film...and, in fact, that's what it should have been. The film was terribly fast-paced and left out some of the more necessary plot elements of the book. They jumped into the darker elements way too quickly. There is barely a set up for the horror to come. That they left out Norma Crandall was very disappointing as she added to Judd's character so much. He's barely even interesting in the film. Fred Gwynn turned him into a goofy, drawling, old man. Over-acted. Not subtle at all, as his character was in the book. Ellie, the daughter, was a terrible actress. I am sure they could have found a better actress than her. She was whiny and abrasive and her lines were very forced and unnatural. Even the cinematography was badly done. Everything is way too bright for the plot line. Too many primary colors. It felt like they were on the set of a soap opera. At least it matches the acting of the principal characters. They tried to sew it all up with gory makeup effects, but set in the backdrop of a badly made film, it just makes the blood and gore goofy and laughable. The only way this film could be considered ""scary"" is with the cheap haunted-house ""BOO!"" scare tactics...like when a hand shoots out of the dark and grabs a shoulder. Why would they choose Mary Lambert to direct this film? She barely had any experience as a director before this gig and most of the experience she did have was with music videos. And, as expected, beyond this flop, she has barely done anything worth mentioning. Well, except for more music videos and the follow-up stinker sequel to this film.Let's hope the 2008 re-make is better.",0
"I love Christmas music. Even when I worked retail, and the Christmas music started playing before Halloween, I loved Christmas music. Growing up, we always knew that it was really Christmas time because Dad pulled out the Christmas albums (not pictures -- records. Yes, I'm that old). Perry Como and Elvis, year in and year out. Now I have my own musical tastes, and my own Christmas music. Jazz, contemporary, blues, even a copy of Rock Power Praise's Christmas heavy metal compilation. And somewhere on my hard drive I have Joan Jett singing ""The Little Drummer Boy.""This Windham Hill Christmas compilation is much more traditional. But traditional doesn't mean boring -- in fact, just the opposite. These songs are arranged so that you can play them no matter what the occasion -- a Christmas party with friends, a tree trimming party, or just a quick game of ""find the mistletoe"" with someone special. And next year, you won't be replacing it with something more trendy.The CD does contain a fair amount of religious music, so those who are easily offended by actual references to Christ may not be pleased. ""Angels We Have Heard on High"" is one of my all-time favorite Christmas hymns, and I was glad that they chose it to start the album off. There are plenty of non-sectarian songs on here as well, though -- ""O Tannanbaum,"" ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town,"" and ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" are a few representatives that I enjoyed particularly.Windham Hill fans will find some old favorites on this CD, of course. Liz Story does ""O Thou Joyful Day/O Little Town of Bethlehem,"" Philip Aaberg contributes ""Wassail Song,"" and George Winston and Will Ackerman also make contributions. There are some new faces as well, and I'm sure we'll be hearing more from folks like Jim Brickman and Fred Simon. In fact, Winston's ""Cherry Tree Carol"" was a wonderful addition, and a song that I hadn't heard very much before.The only thing that disappointed me, especially after enjoying Winston's fretwork on the final song, is that ""Silent Night"" wasn't performed on solo acoustic guitar. Barbara Higbie does an outstanding job on the song, and I enjoyed it quite a bit, but I absolutely love to hear ""Silent Night"" played on the guitar, as it was originally written and performed.On the whole, listening to this CD was a perfectly enjoyable experience, and a great way to start off my holiday season. If you don't have it, then you need it",0
"This book was very good.  The author was very thorough in his explanation of his regimine.  I found it to be a very informative book.  My husband and I and several friends have been doing the Lecithin and the Cayenne for about a month, and our cholesterol has dropped several points.  Mine went from 241 down to 174 in less than three weeks.  My doctor was amazed at the results.Thank you,S. SelixSatisfied CustomerArizon",1

"Al  leer éste libro he podido sentir con el autor , toda la tragedia que significó para  él  no ver  a sus padres los últimos años de su vida y no poder acompañarlos en su enfermedad y muerte como así también  las privaciones , cárceles y  las secuelas de la guerra . Sentí el desgarro en su alma,  por no  poder volver  a su país, por su ausencia  definitiva  de   la  belleza&quot; abstracta &quot; de Petersburgo. Es una obra conmovedora  que  me   transmitió la tragedia vivida por su pueblo y por él mismo  durante muchos  años...En fin Brodsky hace sentir al lector como sólo puede hacerlo  un  gran escritor , que está a la altura de los  mas importantes creadores Rusos de todos los tiempos",1
"I recommend this book for several reasons.  Not only is it a thoroughly entertaining read, it also makes an important statement about all the things that people in this day and age are going through.  I didn't feel as though I was reading about Native Americans from a white person's point of view.  I felt like I was reading about fellow human beings who go through some of the same things I do.  Reading this book made me feel a range of emotions, and also left me with a different way to look at situations that life may present me with",1
"I reviewed the German twin to this book and as in that one, this is just a limited sampler of a few, and probably more representative U.S. Tanks in WWII.This book though is more technically specific and less scattered as its German counterpart. The colored photographs are very accurate and the angles taken are documenting very well how these Shermans, Stuarts, Pershings and Hellcats, as well as some half-tracks looked in their glory days.This is why I gave it a 5 easy stars. It is not so much for the color factor. Almost all vehicles are in dull Olive Drab or Olive Green, so do not expect some fancy camo here, like in the German twin. Rather expect to understand how many variants there were of just one vehicle and the history of its progression throughout WWII.You actually get pictures of for instance, an M3A1 back to back with its later cousin, the M5A1.You get the progression of the M2A1 half-track into the M3A2 and its variants, like the M16 (all well documented, with accurate reconstructions of these vehicles and their photos).In this, the book is totally different in scope from its German counterpart.While the German one documented the variants of German AFVs, from light to heavy and their various employments on the front, the present one deals more in the fast development of U.S. tanks in response to the German pressure put upon the American industry to respond to a very serious threat, which the German tanks represented.There are some of the most beautiful pictures ever taken of the M18 Hellcat and M26/T26 Pershing, but also highly detailed interior photos of the M3A1 scout car and Half-Tracks used by the Infantry.This, together with its ""German"" counterpart, added to Jean Restayn's highly informative drawings contained in ""Tanks of World War Two"", should enlighten anybody interested in modeling accurate replicas or just study in detail these ""beasts of war"".Highly recommended",1
"Whoracle is one of In Flames greatest albums ever and most certainly a top 10 in the all time Melodic Death Metal charts. Its great metal with a distinct mood and auora surrounding it. It has that classic In Flames folky element to it and its great stuff all the way. If your a IF fan a must own, a melodic death metal fan a must own, a folk metal fan a must own and general metal fan guess what its a must own album!! Pick it up its deff one of their best efforts and a classic sure to live on for many years as it already is today. I picked it up upon its release and its still great to listen too and I do listen to it about every other day",0

"A friend of mine let me borrow her 1998 edition of this book, as a transplant southerner I need all the help I can get.  I found every plant I have in my yard, most have been given to me by friends.  I didn't know some of the names or anything about the plants except the little info that was shared along with the plants.  This book is wonderful and well worth the cost, I would recommend this book to anyone living in the south!  The pictures are lovely and the information is great.  It covers everything, the other sections about compost, planting, ect have also been of great assistance.  If you buy this book or give it as a gift everyone will really enjoy it",1

"To Doug Wilhelm:Today I checked The Revealers out from our school library. I thought it was going to be just another novel about the lives and troubles of kids. But it wasn't. I discovered a message. The book you wrote is powerful, and it made me think. About how better our world could be if we just said the truth. About how bullying is not just one kid picking on another.Because bullying leaves scars. On your heart, and in your head. You begin to believe that just because this one person harasses you, your life will be miserable. And then you stop trying to stand up for yourself, to fight back.I completely agree with what Turner said about isolation. Isolation started it all. Except that I understood it in a different sense. I believe that one of the most important keys to bullying is isolation. You keep them away from their friends, just for a few minutes and they're helpless. That's the way it is in modern society. I also agree with what Elliot said about traveling in a pack and how it's safer. You straggle away from your herd of pals, and *CHOMP* the bullies isolate and destroy you, just like what you would see in a video game.Your book inspired me to try out the same project in my school. I wondered, will the results be higher or lower because it's an elementary school? Will the stories be different?I think everyone should read your book. Because they will understand it, no matter what. Your book is so inspirational, so deep that I could cry. Thank you, for writing such a good book.Doha, Qata",1
"I have a 7 year old daughter who loves learning, and loves animals (especially ocean ones).  This book is great, and I have yet to find an activity in it that is hard to either find the materials for or to do.  Definitely a book to keep!  The activities are fun for both teacher, and kids, most would be good as either a group or a one on one activity",1
"I came across the 'State Fair Tweaker Remix' when I was doing some homework on Tweaker's remixes (which are almost always 4 star or 5 star work) and this track on this album is no exception.  Liking that song so much I wanted to hear his 2nd ""ambient"" mix along with Rasputina's work.  This maxi single was a great buy, the songs are really interesting and Tweaker's remix work is outstanding.1. At the State Fair with a White Trash Sucker - a really great industrial song remix.  Complex and interesting composition and great vocal work from the female singer of Rasputina.  This remix alone makes the CD worth it's purchase.2. Sweet Water Kill - Somewhat laid back synthy feel good track.  The vocals have some echo to them and give a very trippy feeling, almost something you would expect from the best style that Cocteau Twins have to offer.  Another track that makes this maxi stellar.3. State Fair (Tweaker Mix) - Another great take on the State Fair track.  This time with Tweaker's classic industrial guitar work.  Good drive in this song with dark overtones and the strings really add a lot of depth to the quality of this remix.4. Antique High Heel Red Doll Shoes - Kind of speedy with uninteresting, heavily filtered guitar work.  The singing is outright annoying and I can say this track is really bad.  So bizarre that quality control would let this out when the rest of this maxi is so 5 star material.5. Deep in the Sweet Water - Starts out with some great string work and a muted beat.  Another track that makes me wonder how I missed out on Rasputina for all these years, great!6. The Fox in the Snow - Great string orchestra type work but it sounds like the singer needs to work on her high notes a little bit.  The singing is a bit whiney but I still like this song.  Also it seems they shoved too many lyrics in certain lines as she has to speed up to say all the words in time, which sounds a bit amateur.  If this was an instrumental it would be a 4.5/5 star track, but the singing could have been massaged into something better and drags the track down a full star for me.  My wife, who sings professionally, finds the singing totally unlistenable and annoying, but I don't nit pick singing skill as much.7. State Fair (Tweaker ambient mix) - A great remix, missing the guitar work and much more strings in this version.  IT's a bit minimal at times but I love every minute of it.  It's very similar to Tweaker's other remix just stripped down, but it's still awesome",0
"I don't have an ipod docking station in my car and I used to keep my Nano in a soft jewellery bag to prevent the screen from scratches. The Toughskin also has a clear screen protector to view the songs, etc. The tough material definitely protects the nano. I now leave the Nano in my cup holder. It also has a detachable clip to clip it to your belt / clothes. A definite buy if you are not looking for an aesthetic cover but for a rugged used protective case",0

"The Passionate Teacher- Robert Fried.  Robert Fried has identified and grasped that creative, emotional spark that all good teachers have experienced when they really connect with their classes and the curriculum.  The beauty of the book is that it articulates what passion in education is.  There has been a black- hole around this topic because teachers are often so busy that they don't  have time to reflect on what made particular lessons a `buzz'  and researchers tend to avoid messy subjects like `passion'.     While fulfilling a major step forward in identifying the characteristics of `passion', in a practical sense Fried offers strategies and snapshots to reignite that passion in the classroom.   Oh, and just a reminder- passion is not a solitary condition, it needs more than one person- it's not something that teachers alone experience!  This is the most useful and inspiring book on education that I've read for a very long time",1

"This is just a wonderful novel, Clavell at the heightof his powers, and an object lesson to anyone who, 40 years later, wants to write a big, sprawling, historical novel.  One of the things that sets Tai-Pan apart from so many books in this genre is that the story is entirely character-driven, and the characters who drive it are wonderful: larger than life without being overblown, consistent throughout, and always engaging.  I somehow missed Clavell when he was writing, but a few months back I decided to give him a try, and I have to say that when he's good, as he is here, he's at the top of the class.  This is an especially tremendous read for anyone who's lived in, or is interested in, Asia, but it's hard to imagine anyone failing to enjoy it",1
"I kept hearing about these books because ""Spike"" from Buffy reads them but didn't really know why else I should care.  Then I saw the show on SCIFI.  Then I found out the author lives in the town next to mine.  I thought maybe I should read one.  Well the one has gotten me hooked and I'll be plowing through them all I'm sure.  I too compare them to Harry Potter mostly for the magic and wizards but Harry is a lot more fun than Harry Potter.  I love the series but I like the books better.  I understand the changes they made for the series but the books are as usual, much richer and more complex.  Who knew that all the names you've ever heard for Werewolves meant different kinds?  Harry did or he found out from Bob.  The character of Harry is a wonderful throw back to nice old fashioned guys who want to protect women and do the right thing, he just also happens to be a wizard.  I like that in this book you find that there will be something evil that is in the background and will be showing itself as you go forward, it gives you a reason to keep reading, aside from the books just being a lot of fun to read.  I hope Harry stays around for a good long run, I'll be waiting for each new adventure",1
"______________________________________________Andy Grove, CEO of the phenomenally successful Intel Corp, is clearly worth listening to on the subject of management.  The ""Wintel"" success story is well known.  More harrowing was Intel's earlier self-transformation from making memory chips to making microprocessors.How to steer an enterprise thru a major change in its business, per Mr. Grove:  1)  Figure out if a major change is imminent.  If so, you're about to enter what Grove calls ""the valley of death"".2)  Figure out how to deal with it.  Largely (for CEOs), this involves listening to your employees & doing your homework.3)  Set a new course, sell it to your company, and stick to it.The ""secret"" to success here is identifying the oncoming crisis early & reacting sensibly.  He relates the story of Apple, a company with clearly superior products - the Mac operating system, the first good laser printer - completely missing the shift from proprietary to open PC standards, and ending up as a niche player.  John Sculley, then Apple's CEO, acknowledged this crucial mistake years later.  Groves thinks Sculley knew this shift was happening , but wasn't able to overcome Apple's ""inertia of success"".   Curiously, this was pretty much the same problem IBM had when PCs began displacing mainframes.  It's very hard for an organization to give up a strategy that has been richly rewarded in the past.In management, as in engineering, we often learn more from failures than successes.  Grove's case histories will make informative reading for anyone in business.  Not many of us are CEOs, but we'll all go thru Grove's ""strategic inflection points"" in our careers.Review copyright 1998 by Peter D.

"Its not often in this busy life that you can settle back and listen to the voices of angels weave a peaceful tapestry around you while earthly cares fade and vanish in the ether.  The Anonymous 4 are weavers of wonder and peace.  No matter that your spiritual persuasion might not be Roman Catholic - or any other established Old World Church.  If this music doesn't calm your savage soul and lead you to offer a prayer of thanksgiving for the purest qualities of the human voice, nothing will.  Stick with your Heavy Metal.  ""The Lily and the Lamb""  isn't for you.If you are someone who appreciates classical, Baroque, and/or Renaissance music, do not hesitate to enjoy this CD.

"This is one of those revolutionary Bay Area Gangsta Rap albums that blows a lot of that mainstream crap out the water then and now. The music brilliantly blends different eras of RnB, funk, with some hardcore rap beats that sound like devil-worshipping tunes, LOL. 11/5 consist of three members, TaydaTay, Maine-o, and Hennessy. Each of them giving a clever perspective on the street game topics they cover. The only track to skip is #1, the usual repetitive Herm ""Keep The Peace"" preaching. Despite that minor mishap, this has all the ingredients that make a classic record. Short, sweet, edgy, and consistent. What more can you ask for",0
"This is the first book I ever read about the Beatles when I was 17, fourteen years ago.  Since then, I have read dozens of books about the boys, but this one is truly hard to top.  When I first read it, I thought the author must have sensationalized much of what happened, because the Beatles' story seemed so incredibly dramatic and juicy.  But when I returned to the book several years later, I was struck by how accurate the book was.  Although Phillip Norman's book, the one frequently cited as ""the"" definitive text, is essential reading, this is really just as good.  Unlike Norman's serious book, Brown makes no bones about utilizing all of the juicy aspects of the Beatles' saga in a narrative that reads like a best-selling novel rather than a biography.  I don't disagree that some of the details are a shade inaccurate and some notorious rumors are promulgated in this book, but isn't so much of the fun in being a Beatles fan in doing the detective work of reading all of the different books on the Beatles and figuring out for yourself how the events really unfolded?  Furthermore, any mistakes in the book seem like the product of misinformation rather than maliciousness, and really, very little in the book is incorrect.  Anyway, this book is the most readable of all the books on the boys, and as this is the one that instigated my almost religous obsession with the boys--whether that's an endorsement or warning is for you to decide--I highly recommend it.  And my god, look at that fantastic new cover!    ",1
"I bought the 250D lens to use with my Sony DSC-F717 and it is just wonderful. I can also use it with my Canon G3 because I bought a Canon LADC58B Conversion Lens Adapter (which is required and is inexpensive). I had been hearing a lot of good things about this lens in digital photography forums and I have seen many wonderful examples of its use. I recommend this lens to anyone who wants to make their ""macro"" photography shine. Get one! Just be clear that there is the 52mm and the 58mm and don't be confused as to which one will fit your camera.Edit: Just a clarification: This one 'is' the ""58mm"" even though above (on this page) when you click the links ""See More Technical Details"" and ""See all Product Description"" it mentions ""52mm"". This is misleading and confusing. At the very very top of this page it says ""58mm"".

"A Murder for Her Majesty is exciting but completely unreliable as a historical novel.  It is full of major and minor anachronisms:  the choir sings carols that weren't written till the 19th century; York Minster uses an order of service appropriate to late 20th century American Episcopal churches but totally inaccurate for Elizabethan ritual; the political organization of the church (""the Queen could not appoint bishops herself"") is completely backwards--bishops WERE, in fact, appointed by the Queen--Alice is portrayed as eating a potato and drinking tea, both of which were not in the English diet till 100 or more years later; there are house numbers (a 19th century invention) and on and on and on.  It's outrageous not only that the author's own research was so sloppy but that nobody anywhere along the editorial process caught any of this.  What's the use of a historical novel if the history it teaches is so utterly inaccurate",1
"I really do love this product.  It works as great as I hoped it would.  The nightvision is amazing.  The screen on the monitor is small, but the picture is usually very clear.  One of my favorite features is the ability to put it on a standby mode.  Then when the baby makes noise the picture and sound come on automatically.  This way I don't have to have it on staring me in the face all night while I try to sleep.  But it comes on when I need it to.  We have a 5.8 Ghz phone and a 2.4 Ghz wireless internet system.  That is why I chose this monitor and it works great with no interference.  We can have the baby in her room upstairs and take the monitor all over the house and it works great.  It does run out the batteries pretty fast if you don't have it plugged in, but it's not much of a problem for us.  We just take the cord and plug it in wherever we need it.  I am very pleased.  I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews for baby monitors, but I am very happy that we bought this one!",0
"the author himself states that this is not a surgical analysis of the innermost workings of the empire itself- this is a historical narrative of the empire's roots and beginnings, and its rise and fall. it is not just a story, however. mr norwich strives for the truth of what is behind the making of byzantium, and the people who made into what it was, and is very balanced and unbiased in the statements he makes, and doesn't pull any punches. this book will be especially rewarding for those who have come close to suicide reading painfully dry history books of similar stock. this is probably the most beautifully written history book i have ever read. mr norwich is funny, emotional, and his writing tone is fluid and personal. if you are interested in byzantium and want to know more about it, READ THIS SERIES. it does not disappoint",1
"The amazing thing about a Christopher Makos Book is that by looking at his images in a concentrated environment, you gain access into the artist' real vision. While most photographers shoot subject matter, Makos tends to capture the soul of an object or human being and blend it with his own and create something unique that we havent seen or wish to see again. It is about memories, new experiences, and is very thought provoking. This book is one of his best compilations of new photos that i havent seen. I love it!",1

"Even nearly nine years after it was first written, this book continues to be valuable for more reasons than when it was published. If you are still involved in VRML and have some need to learn this language, this book is a complete guide that starts from the beginning with the simplest concepts and shape definitions and then builds to advanced concepts such as textures, lighting, and fog. Throughout the book there are figures of the resulting images and plenty of sample VRML files for all examples. I do agree with the other reviewers that chapter 30, the one on scripting, is really the only chapter that is no longer worthwhile since so many changes have been made to the scripting part of VRML. Other than that, this is truly one of the best written and most instructive tech books I have ever bought. If you are going to study VRML, there is no longer any other book in existence but this one that is worth owning.The second reason to own this book has only popped up over the last two or three years. Since Xj3D began to come on the scene several years ago as the XML-based open-source replacement for VRML, this book has become invaluable for evaluating that tool's ability to build virtual worlds. In fact, the Web3D consortium's ""test files"" for Xj3D, which continues to be a work in progress, are VRML files from this book that have been translated into Xj3D. Since the base tags are the same in Xj3D as they are in VRML, if you are able to understand VRML you should be able to understand what's going on in an Xj3D file with just a little investigation into the basic differences. This will allow you to intelligently evaluate Xj3D and determine if you can find any weaknesses or discrepancies in that tool's implementation",1

"Not for the faint of chemistry, ""Nanochemistry: A Chemical Approach to Nanomaterials"" by Geoffrey Ozin and Andre Arsenault explains the creation and function of materials with at least one dimension between one and 1000 nanometers.  If you seek a light narrative about what nanotechnology will bring our world, Nanochemistry is not your book (and it's too heavy to read in bed anyway).  If, on the other hand, you seek the scientific details of how nanomaterials really work, this is your textbook or reference.Ironically, Nanochemistry opens with Einstein's famous quote, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge.""  The book, however, is a testimony to imagination being built upon knowledge, as telegraphed by this early sentence: ""The genesis of a creative idea, first and foremost, requires a knowledge bank of all classes of solids and how to make them.""  The table of contents covers the waterfront of material building blocks and self-assembly, stopping short of molecular manufacturing and molecular machine systems:1.	Nanochemistry basics2.	Chemical patterning and lithography3.	Layer-by-layer self-assembly4.	Nanocontact printing and writing - stamps and tips5.	Nanorod, nanotube, nanowire self-assembly6.	Nanocluster self-assembly7.	Microspheres - colors from the beaker8.	Microporous and mesoporous materials from soft building blocks9.	Self-assembling block copolymers10.	Biomaterials and bioinspiration11.	Self-assembly of large building blocks12.	Nano and beyond13.	Nanochemistry nanolabsThe introductory chapter is playful in setting the stage, using a sketch of a radiolarian and a photograph of Gaudi's Sagrada Familia church in Barcelona to illustrate organic patterns.  But this is a serious book designed for the serious student: Each chapter concludes with a list of questions (""Nanofood for Thought"") that demand creative synthesis, not simply finding the answer in the chapter.  In spite of the breadth of material, Nanochemistry covers it in detail, with ample illustrations and footnotes (averaging more than 100 footnotes per chapter).  The authors' claim that ""the book should be useful to a broad readership"" is a bit optimistic, given the familiarity with chemistry it demands, but Nanochemistry will certainly be quite useful to those who wish to understand how to synthesize nanoscale materials and structures.I am the Director of Education for the Foresight Nanotech Institute and the author of Technology Challenged: Understanding Our Creations & Choosing Our Future",1
This movie was great in my opionion.It deals with every aspect of being in a rodeo and being a cowboy. I love this much as much as 8 Seconds.Their both great! The ending is VERY sad and yes I shedded some tears....if you can't handle seeing some extremely saddening part this movie isn't for you,0
"  This is a fun game. I rarely play games (last two I really played was Dungeon keeper and Final Fantasy 7) Very enjoyable, really not at all difficult if you have a pulse and the story was really cool. My gripes are it was too easy, evil mode is rather boring, you age and everyone else does not, too short. Too short is the major gripe. The only difficult part is the prison sequence which was also the best drama of the story in my opinion, I actually got angry and then saddend by the events.They need to make a sequal which is much longer, actually has a point in evil mode and gives some simbalance of in game time with character age.Buy it anywa",0
"From the 3 duet compilations produced so far, ""Shaman"" is truly the best. Of course, it depends on taste and that is subjective, but there's lots of talent on this CD. And as always you hear Santana's guitar cry. You'll find Macy Gray with ""Amore"" and Michelle Branch with ""The Game of Love"" as well as ""Novus"" featuring Placido Domingo, and the excellent Dido with ""Feels Like Fire."" Well, I have all three compilations and I've listened to them all many, many times, but while no CD can be absolutely perfect like anything else in life, I find that ""Shaman"" has a lot of quality tunes on it",0
"If the words elegant and eloquence strike a chord with you, then view this film for Burt Lancaster's fine and lasting gift of both. Watch the ending first as Burt richly, if too briefly, narrates a glorious ending to a less  than glorious life - then rewind and watch the unwinding of a story that  ended so touchingly - you will lose nothing of the story through that  process. In this story that seems so much about family, there comes shining  through the triumph of the solitary man - a man truly in the world but not  of it. And in his grandchildren - not yet tainted and corrupted by  convention - there is the hope that compromise and accomodation will be be  held at bay for yet another hour. Did we ever tell Burt thank you? Tell him  now",0
"From the end of the Civil War to the beginning of the first World War there was a flowering of American writing. Here a good representation of it is grouped together under the heading of 'American Realism and Naturalism'. The 'Realism' is the critical term of William Dean Howells and the Naturalism is much more suitable to certain writers, say Harold Frederic, than it is to others, say Henry James. In short there is a great variety of voices in this collection and taken together they give a sense of the energetic motion of American life and literature at the time. Some of it is great literature, James , Twain, Crane , and much of it is competent first- class writing. A very worthwhile anthology for one who wishes to both enjoy first- rate Literature and have a special insight into a period of American Literary History",1
I wish I had been taught all of these little tricks of the trade before I was tossed in and baptized by fire.  My first years of teaching would have been DRASTICALLY different.

"            Have you ever heard of IPTU Test? Well I have. The book was ""Testing Miss Malarkey."" The class was close to ""the test."" So Miss Malarkey and every adult in school and home were acting weird. They play math game during recess, eat fish and brain food at lunch, in art they learn how to bubbles in circle, and at P.E. they didn't even do P.E. they were learn how to relax stress for ""the test,"" when one boy took the attendance he heard Mr.Wiggin was talking something about #2 pencil. Even moms were acting weird. She read a kid a book and told them to write a surmmary about it. And for breakfast this kid got a powerbar 2000. Then finally they took ""the test."" A lot of kid had a hard time time. People were sleeping, some were drawing, some were even erasing the whole test, and some didn't even do it.  I think it's a good book cause can help kids relax during the big test.",1
"This is THE BEST book I have ever read in elementary electronics, and I have read many. It does not overload the beginner with complex circuit analysis, and yet is in-depth enough for an entry level electronics technician. After studying this book, you will be well prepared to take on more advanced studies. The range of topics is excellent, written in an easy to digest style, and the projects help seal the facts in your mind. I highly recommend to the beginner",1
"A bizarre, brilliant, deranged story as only Edward Lee could tell it.  A haunted house novel by way of Lee is not only savage, sexy, and way way out there, but it's also extremely well-researched and has a genuine authentic feel to it.  Lee has put in plenty of time studying paranormal matters and fusing them with his backwoods kink horror, producing a whole new take on the trope of the haunted house.  Horrific, nasty, insightful, and full of chills, if you dig Lee you'll love this one from start to finish.  Highly recommended. ",1

"How did Gibbon do it?!  This book is so good and so rich on so many levels, and the centuries have not made it any less a terrific read than it must have been when first published.  There are so many reasons to read it -- I'll choose one.  If you want to understand human nature in something approaching all it's depth and complexity, you can do no better than to read Gibbon's tales of what happens when a long succession of very different characters attain total dominion over the entire civilized world.  The incredible variety of comedy, calamity and infamy is unmatched even in Greek Myths or the Bible, and to my mind, at least, the story telling is better",1

"While Hag's voice is not quite the instrument that it was during his first stint on Capitol, his weathered vocals suit the material on this album quite well. This album features a lot of the giants of his late-peak years, with production by Jimmy Bowen and Mike Post, and a roster of great musicians such as Herb Pedersen, Reggie Young, Billy Joe Walker Jr and Leland Sklar and more. The musicians are put to good use - there is a beautiful instrumental passage on the title track that lasts about a minute before Hag starts into his vocals.I suppose ""Chicago Wind"" is a truck driving song, but I'd call it a desolation ballad, and no one can write about the forlorn and lonely like Haggard. Hag also can express a subdued anger,  as is evident on ""America First"", or a questioning and lively ""Where's All The Freedom"" wherein Haggard poses questions, sometimes rhetorical, about the direction the  country is going.Other Hag tunes include a reworking of his 1970 classic ""White Man Singin' The Blues"" and an interesting duet with Toby Keith on ""Some Of Us Fly"".Hag wrote seven of the tunes, which leaves room for some exquisite cover tunes. Roger Miller's ""Leavin's Not The Only Way To Go"" isn't covered all that often but it deserves to be revived more often with it's reflections on decisions made and not made. Hag also covers his buddy Willie Nelson's ""It Always Will Be"" the title cut of one of Willie's many albums issued in the last few years. A quiet and gentle ballad, Hag covers it perfectly.While my favorite country singers are Ernest Tubb and Webb Pierce, Merle Haggard is the greatest country artist EVER. I am delighted that he continues to produce vital work    ",0
"D-Train represents some of the best of R&B old skool to come out of the early 80's. It definitely wasn't disco and it wasn't formulaic pop. It's the great funk and soul void that was filled before rap and other styles of urban soul would take the airwaves by storm... D-Train's unique musical and vocal style was unmatched by any other smooth and slick funk/soul duo act during this period ! No other duo or artist sounded like them...Their sophisticated blend of synth and bass work along with  J. Williams' deep and almost gospel-like vocals flowed so smoothly and had that mesmerizing hook to it !...The music in general could make even the worse of two-left feet dancers get up and shake their stuff !...You can call D-Train's musical style urban soul, 80's dance, funk... One thing is for sure;  it's definitely pleasing to the ears, soul, mind, heart and feet.The other great D-Train album title (found only as an import c.d.) is ""Something's On Your Mind""...while not as popular or having that great musical impact like ""You're the One For me"" , it is still worthy of obtaining from 1984",0
"THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK HAS NO EXPERIENCE COVERING SPORTS. IN HER FIRST ATTEMPT I THINK SHE DOES A VERY GOOD JOB DESCRIBING THE CHAMPIONSHIP SEASON OF THE 2000 LAKERS.

Everything is covered here for us age-phobic boomers, such as investments, insurance, housing, social security, health care, educating our kids and taking care of our aging parents.

"I saw this film for the first time when I was very young.  I went with my parents to see it when it was first premiered.  CinemaScope had recently been 'born' and the novelty of the wide screen and the stereophonic sound were still fresh.  The 'high and windy hill' with the panaroma of Hong Kong were as much a part of the film as the actors and the dialogue and were a joy to see.  I expect that by today's standards  this is a corny film, politically incorrect, and of little value.  However, I still film it a delight.  This film has charm, something that can not be said about many movies or of actors today, and a joy to behold when watched.  Certainly, one has to be a 'romantic' to enjoy it and, I for one, am not ashamed to be labelled as such.  I remember when I first saw this film, many people in the cinema were seen to be wiping their eyes once it concluded as the house lights came up.  I suspect that many still do this when they watch it for the first time",0
"This book is a daily reader.  The author's words are at once educational, spiritual, and humane.

"I remember reading this short book first when I was much younger, and most recently a few weeks ago, at almost twenty years of age.  This is a fabulous story - it was then and I think I enjoyed it even more now.  One of the major things I took out of it was the reason some parents are so  adamant about their children making presents rather than buying them - when  you make something the end result isn't the sum total of the project -  there is time and love and thought involved.  When we, in today's over  commercialized society, just walk into a store and pick up the first thing  we see some of the individuality of the gift is taken away almost.  And so  although Mama wasn't immediately impressed by her wonderful store bought  present as Anna hoped, as soon as she learned the amount of work and time  that was spent in earning that money is when she truly understood the  impact of the gift.  It also teaches children that although parents and  adults may sometimes seem unreasonable and uncomprehensible to our young  minds, there is a rationale behind what they do.  Sometimes finding out  what that is is more important than following the &quot;rules&quot; so to  speak. :)  A truly delightful book, perfect for younger readers as well as  older.  I recommend it to everyone",1
"Greenstein's The Presidential Difference is short and sweet. It condenses the story of our Presidents from FDR to George W. Bush into an easy to read manner. Each chapter is dedicated to a President and gives six points upon which they are evaluated, which makes comparisons with other Presidents in the book easy. Even with only 223 pages nothing seems to be left out. The book is engaging from beginning to end and before you know it you have gone through twelve presidencies. To end it all Greenstein wraps 13 chapters up in a magnificent conclusion titled ""Lessons from the Modern Presidency"". There isn't any more one can ask for. I highly recommend this book as a good read, that is fun, short, and a great way to brush up on knowledge of our Presidents.  ",1

"I am very familiar with the material discussed in this work, and Homza's interpretations of history are not at all accurate.  She completely underemphasizes the brutality of the Spanish Inquisition and, instead, portrays the process as &quot;enlightened upholding of social norms.&quot;  Furthermore, her writing style is choppy and has no flow.  It reads something like an old telegram [stop] I was greatly anticipating this work, as it deals with a pet subject of mine, but Homza really failed to live up to my expectations.

"The idea that the Red Sox were cursed because Harry Frazee sold the Bambino to finance a show is a misnomer at best, and a sincere lack of honesty at worst. The true reason the Red Sox failed to win a World Series title in 86 years was due to ethnic racism, pure and simple. The Red Sox had Jackie Robinson tryout in Fenway Park and commented that Robinson was a great hitter, but it was ""too bad that he was colored"". They also watched Willie Mays in a tryout and passed up the opportunity to sign him. They refused to have a young Henry Aaron tryout for the team when they found out he was colored. That is how the old Boston Braves were able to sign Aaron in 1952 to play for them (albeit in Milwaukee) and the fabled cross town rivals were not. Racism was the true curse of the Boston Red Sox. Boston has had a serious problem with racial hatred in the neighborhoods of Dorchester and Roxbury for decades and refusing to acknowledge this problem leads the naive to assume that there could be any relationship to the trade of Babe Ruth to the NY Yankees and the 86 year drought of a World Series championship. Pure, utter nonsense. Racism was their curse.",1
"Just in time for Halloween . . . More thrills and chills than you can shake your broom stick at. The best of the lot is Inner Sanctum Mysteries, a six-film collection of death, dementia and darkness based on the spine-chilling Inner Sanctum Mystery radio series of the '40s. All the flicks star Lon Chaney Jr., who really never got his deserved credit, his legacy lost among the huge shadows cast by his father. The stories are puffy and pale, but the suspense holds up nicely, certainly not in the Hitchcock or Luten schools, but edgy enough for you to keep the lights on . . . just in case. This is not to say that the Karloff collection is not worthy. These are ""forgotten"" films, released for the first tike of DVD because they never achieved the success or status of Frankenstein or The Mummy. Yet Karloff personifies the word ""menace."" Lon Chaney Jr. joins him for The Black Castle, but it's Tower of London takes the highpoint. More a film about a horrific time in history than a horror film, Karloff plays a bloodthirsty executioner to Basil Rathbone's evil King Richard III. Torture has never tasted so terrifying",0
"We are living in a time when we are being drowned by information from all sides. While this can be a good thing, when you are a person who is interested in investing in the financial markets, so much information can get to be a nuisance. But thankfully there are books like the Astute Investor that ease the way toward achieving the goal of controlling your own financial future.What investing principles and strategies are important? Why do human emotions get in the way of intelligent investing? What is the most promising stock to buy? And how can retirement income be safely doubled, are some of the fundamental questions that are answer in this volume.Eric Prentis has taken bits and pieces of information found in some of the greatest investing books ever written and synthesize that data in this large piece of work. By reading this book, experienced and novice traders alike will find a ton of useful information. At first the book might seem a bit overwhelming due to its vast amount of information, but believe me, if you take your time you will get into the book big time.The book is divided in two parts. The first part contains 10 chapters that include all the steps needed in order to develop a well rounded investing strategy. By following these steps you will never be in the wrong side of the market. The second part of the book covers the steps needed to develop a successful retirement plan. Overall the book can be a great addition to any financial book collection.    ",1
"My enjoyment of the Who's music, curiosity about the legend of Keith Moon, and my interest in drummers and drumming in general led me to check out this rather massive book. By the time I reached the final chapter I was both sad that the story was over and completely emotionally drained, and not exactly sure I was glad to have learned all I had about Moon. Having grown up with an alcoholic/drug-dependant family member, far too much of what Fletcher described of Moon's problems was painfully familiar to me.  The way he treated those who cared for him, particularly the women in his life, was quite terrible and sometimes difficult to read about.Fletcher pulls no punches and presents both Moon's greatnesses and his weaknesses. He illustrates where and how Moon was a genius on the drums yet also where, when and how is performance was sub-par. He does not sugar-coat anything. Still, the end result is not as tawdry and cheap as some celebrity biographies I've read, for the reader gets the impression that Fletcher respects the subject matter instead of simply looking to provide cheap thrills and sensationalism. He also works hard to disprove some of the wilder stories and legends of Moon's behavior and stick with the facts, which may disappoint some who hate to see the legends shattered, but there is still much madness and mayhem that is apparently quite true.If you are a Who fan and/or interested in the story of one of the most legendary drummers of rock music, you owe it to yourself to check out this book. Just be forewarned that you may find it difficult to look at Keith Moon in the same light ever again",1

I think the album samples Beethoven's most remarkable pieces of work from his early years to his death. I have heard many recordings of the Ninth symphony that was just executed poorly; which is a shame because it is such a powerful piece. However, this album does it superbly. Sir Georg Solti and Murray Perahia did an amazing job with this album. The album just flows really well from one piece to the next evoking a vast array of emotions along the way. Beethoven is timeless and forever will be. There is no comparison even to this day. This a wonderful tribute to the artist. ",0

No matter where I have gone, and I take my phone everywhere with me, I have yet to find a place where my phone doesn't have Nextel service.  Also, very durable phone.  I live on a farm here, and we use the two-way often to communicate.  My phone in particular has been dropped several times, once off a grain bin onto concrete 35 feet below, and once also driven over by four wheeler in mud.  Still works like new.  I am extremely happy with Nextel's service and phones.  I know several other people with different model Nextel phones and also can't complain.  I would definitely recommend Nextel over Verizon, Alltel, Cingular, and Sprint.  Other companies have such cheap phones it seems.  It's a shame that Sprint and Nextel merged - from my experience with Sprint, they are terrible with no service anywhere, and their phones suck too",0
"When I bought this and Roorback, I knew immediately that I had struck a nerve since I used to be more attached to the old days of the band with Max Cavalera with Beneath The Remains, Arise, Chaos A.D., and Roots.

For me, Nation hit much harder and held quite a few more surprises. So if you're just looking for the best of the new era of Sepultura, look no further than this title",0

"Away From Home: American Indian Boarding School Experiences is a magnificent collection of writings, poems, photographs, and paintings and illustrations that document American Indian boarding school experiences in the U. S. between 1879-2000. It was collected as a part of a display on exhibit at the Heard Museum until 2005. From the beautiful but sad painting on the cover (Untitled oil on canvas by Angel de Cora, Winnebago) to the dozens of historical photographs within of different aspects of the various Native American boarding school histories, to the poignant letters, poems, and memories of the many contributors, Away From Home is a revelation of repressed racial memories that underlines the need for dialogue specifically with Native voices in order to accept responsibility as well as to encompass and &quot;enrich our view of America's past, present and future (Page 135, Brenda Child).&quot; Away From Home presents a rich assortment of written and pictured memories from such boarding schools as Carlisle Indian School of Pennsylvania, Sherman Indian School, Riverside, California, and Flandreau Indian School, South Dakota. Both the many negative and some surprising positive aspects of boarding school existence are explored. The shattering impact on family and ethnic identification of the boarding school student is not avoided. The notion that perhaps an apology is owed to present day survivors' descendants is actually obliquely presented in a referent to the &quot;Sorry Day&quot; movement of Aboriginal people in Australia. At least the impact of exhibits and books such as Away From Home contain the impetus to a needed dialogue that has yet to be fully heard. Away From Home is a rich collection, filled with many voices and bitter experiences that were braided into strengths. It is a treasure and a measure of the many colors of beauty in the human spirit",1
"Many people say it's the greatest American novel of all times. I disagree, but that doesn't mean that this book isn't excellent. It's very different from many other books, and makes you think long and hard. I read it while driving through the countryside of a most beautiful country, and the effect was amazing. A few things really left an impact on me. I loved one chapter most of all, and that single chapter just made me stop. I stopped and thought, and I was so moved by this chapter that I couldn't keep reading for another few hours.  So much of the book is beautiful. There is amazing imagery stuck in behind the actual story. There's the personal story, the general story, the vague story, and what I feel is the story through images. All of these stories were woven together so well, the seams are completely unnoticable.Even if you don't agree with what I'm saying, or may not like these types of books, it's a classic that must be read, if not for the parts I have already described, then just for the feeling you have afterwards, the feeling of amazement and reflection.Enjoy",1

Jhawar reveals the deepest principles of life that teach us to recognize and embrace the one universal spirit that exists in all human beings as their Real Nature.  Through the experience of this glorious spirit that exists in each of us, we can truly learn to live in harmony with the earth and others, while also allowing the dance of diversity to be valued with utmost love and respect regarding all walks of life.  The author's profound, immaculate wisdom concerning the subjects of world peace, meditation, as well as his pragmatic perspective on the crisis of post-modern issues, reveal striking solutions to the miseries that have befallen upon us on account of our misunderstanding of the sacred and wonderful purpose of human life.  Among our families we struggle to keep joy alive; among our jobs we find only anxiety, tire, and remorse; even our proud nation is but a land of conflicting politics and justice, as we can clearly see, from the striking imbalance of rich and poor, of married and divorced, of happy and depressed; regarding the global spectrum trust seems to be lost, for the moral compass of love, support, and human integrity seems dried up and hidden; and above all, in the very intimate recess of our own personal mind and heart there seems to be only an increasing sense of worry, agitation, frustration, and weariness about the point of life, about the justice of God, if there be such a reality.  Indeed, during such times of immense adversity there exists a responsive energy that we might call ""Light"" amidst the darkness; there is ""Truth"" ever ready to counter the prevailing conditions of deceit and suffering; there is ""Love"" that far surpasses all forms of betrayal and anger.  ""Building a Noble World"" is such a source of ""Light,"" of ""Truth,"" of ""Love,"" which shines bright in showing the way home for humanity, the way to freedom, peace, and harmony on all levels of personal, cultural, national, and global living. I praise the remarkable Shiv Jhawar with my whole being and strongly recommend this read to anyone who is inspired to make the world a better place to live in",1
My ten month old loves Elmo and this book.  We have only had this book for two weeks but it looks older than any of his other books.  He loves the last page where Elmo plays Peek-a-boo.  We do that part over and over and he laughs everytime.  We thought it was worth the money and we're going to buy another Elmo's world book.  Try it,1

"What can I say? It's the absolute best, must have book for ANYONE who has even a slight interest in Astrology. I've been an Astrology enthusiast for over 10 years now and even though my level is more in the intermediate to advanced range, I still find this as an invaluable, handy reference. It perfectly ""walks"" you through this fascinating, yet complex science in a simple and easy to understand format. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to go beyond those fun, yet very general and vague daily horoscopes you find in the paper. It even includes a mail in offer to get your own chart done! (At least my old copy does, not sure about the new edition)This book will help you understand and interpret your chart to give you an enlightening and informative understanding of yourself. It includes chapters that explain and interpret the meanings of all the twelve houses, the signs and their characteristics, the planets and their rulerships, even meanings to all possible aspects of your natal placements. I really wish I had this book when I first developed an in-depth interest in Astrology. Again, A MUST HAVE FOR ANY ASTROLOGY ENTHUSIAST!!",1
"Another reviewer called this the ""lost Talking Heads album,"" which I think is accurate and also hints at a faint yearning, among many of Byrne's most ardent fans (of which I am one), to hear more of the sound that got them hooked in the first place.  For Byrne, Talking Heads has become an albatross, and he seems resentful of his fans' unwillingness to accept his exploration of other avenues.Well, okay; fair enough.  But Byrne's persona within the context of Talking Heads is arguably one of the most intriguing in rock music, and it's only natural for followers to crave access to more.  The Talking Heads catalogue has never been friendly to the completist mentality, as there's not a wealth of unreleased material surfacing -- not even with the recent ""Once in a Lifetime"" and ""Brick"" box sets.  However, what Byrne seems to be doing with his solo career, or wanting to do, is to demystify himself, and he's tried doing this through a variety of measures: with his ""unplugged"" stint; with his ""personal"" work on his self-titled album and recent 'Grown Backwards'; with his down-to-earth collaborations with artists such as Richard Thompson; and with the folksy conversational style he's adopted in his solo concerts.  But the overarching impression still is of a man awkwardly inhabiting a physical body within the physical world, and these attempts to convey a reaching of comfort within these two spaces seem largely calculated.  Additionally, it remains unclear as to whether the vitality and energy the man once radiated is being suppressed or has simply dissipated.One thing that hasn't changed about Byrne is that he's still what detractors would call a dilettant or a tourist, and what friendlier followers would call versatile.  Objectively, it's fair to say that he's always had his hands in many pies, working in and adopting as many mediums as his talents will allow.  One of the most compelling results of this dilettantism/versatility was his collaboration with choreographer Twyla Tharp for the Broadway ballet ""The Catherine Wheel.""  They don't do stuff like this on Broadway anymore.  Current Broadway, safe and posh, is to early '80s Broadway what current Hollywood is to 1970s Hollywood, before Michael Cimino killed it for everyone.  Listening to ""The Catherine Wheel"" evokes this and, among many other things, the excitement of a gifted and vital artist (Byrne) in great demand.  Byrne dove into this as though it were the important task that it was, taking complete command of his assignment without a shred of unease.  ""His Wife Refused,"" ""Big Blue Plymouth (Eyes Wide Open), ""What a Day That Was,"" and ""Big Business"" are practically Talking Heads songs and rank among the best of the Heads' work, while ""Ade,"" ""The Red House,"" ""Black Flag,"" and others, create soundscapes that are at once exotic, exciting, and comforting.  This album, next to (and slightly surpassing) 'Rei Momo,' remains Byrne's best and most assured solo album.",0
"The Analects are fragments of a very ancient Chinese work attributed to Confucius.  Arthur Waley is an outstanding translator and a poet in his own right.  This is a book of wisdom and is extremely helpful to those who wish to explore their own humanity.  There's something here for everyone.  Confucius deals with the eternal human condition: the joy of learning, staying human and trying to do good when it seems impossible to know what is good, how to both lead and follow, the importance of sincerity over showy form, all portrayed by Waley's translation in language as simple and clear as a mountain stream.  I highly recommend this book as a good introduction to Confucianism; to those who are receptive to its message (Judaism has a saying &quot;he who understands will understand&quot;), this book will both clarify and transform one's view of one's individual life in relation to eternity, showing the way to a form of inner harmony that has been beautifully developed over thousands of years of Chinese civilization and from which we in the West could greatly benefit if we open our minds to this kind of learning",1
"Furst gives pulsebeats, atmosphere and apprehension to intrigues of the times that few today will imagine. Furst brings us into a world where small nation-states were emerging and influences such The Commintern was conspiring and The League of Nations was seeking legitimacy.  The hearts and minds, the patriotism, of citizens of countries marginalized in today's studies, are experiences that Furst invites his reader to witness.He introduces characters that are gallant in their simplicity and simply dutiful in their gallantry. There is no preparation for this story. A reader need only relax, turn pages and let the arcane history of a period absorb him or her.In my own indulging in historical intrigues, I have experienced no one but Furst who can bring readers into this milieu. He accomplishes this with a guile even more mysterious than his characters. This reader finds himself a pilgrim in Furst's tour, not wondering how did I get here, but enthused to find where he and his characters are going to take me on the next page.In my mind I know it's fiction, but in my heart, I believe I'm there and then",1

"I do not like store-bought cookies, especially Oreos (too dry and greasy for me). But upon the recommendation of several people, I tried the Ginger O's and was pleasantly surprised.

"An excellent objective account of John McCain.  I was looking for as unbiased book on this presidential hopeful as possible.  I found it in this book.  Although somewhat biased myself, I appreciated the candid remarks  about his renegade attitude and well publicized short temper.  I firmly  believe that this book will help one form his/her own opinion of McCain  rather than attempt to lead you in one direction or another.  If nothing  else, after reading this book, you will surely walk away with an  appreciation if not admiration for what John McCain went through as a 5 1/2  year POW in Viet Nam",1
I should have given more thought to the previous review! Talk about a big disappointment in the number of examples actually presented in this book. Very few problems have actually been solved and even these are quite too simple. I was expecting a book that would really help me prepare for the civil discipline specific portion of the EIT exam. Unfortunately this book only skims the top of major topics and does not go into any sort of detail whatsoever. The book itself is not much thicker than an average National Geographic. My suggestion would be to leave this book alone and study from reference text books,1
"Thank you, Steven, for sharing your stories and your pursuit of the wisdom which God imparted to Solomon who then wrote them down for the generations. Whether you believe or not, many of the principles act much like the laws of physics which govern the natural order. I'm not aware of scripture where God asks us to pray for the laws of gravity, aerodynamics, thermodynamics or even for the sun to come up, or for tides, etc. they just work to everyone's benefit as long as our actions don't conflict with the know physical laws. Likewise, God has instituted laws of self governance and behavior that when followed yield positive outcomes toward long life, happiness and prosperity. I enjoyed and recommend the book",1
Incredible book combining the newest scientific advances in anti-aging and just great health in general.  I appreciate that it's extremely easy for the layman to understand.  It's so exciting to know that you can take your health in your own hands and drastically improve it by following the wisdom in this book.  I was struck by how much it just makes sense!  I'm very impressed and have recommended the book to many people already,1
"We have had such success with the other videos in this series that I just had to get this new one. Like the rest, it's adorable and fun and helped my daughter learn her colors in no time.

"Unlike some other listeners I did not accidently purchase this album, nor was I disappointed.  Creative bands continually explore their sound, unlike some bands (ie. Bush).  ""Whiplash"" is different than their CD's ""Laid"" (which was mellow) or ""Millionares""  (which is heavy on the synth side), this release boasts powerful guitars, classic James lyrics and a different direction.  Overall this reminds me of their Gold Mother disc, which was fun and unpredictable.  Their sound is unique to other releases and more resembles the extra songs from their ""Best of"" CD like Runaground & Destiny Calling.  There is more James than Brian Eno on this disc unlike ""Laid"" or ""Pleased to meet you"" which were heavily influenced by Eno.  If you like the more upbeat James you've heard check this release out.  A great selection for the car by the way, especially when driving at high speeds..",0
"I really enjoy this product, and am sure that voice-recognition will be standard techology for all computers one day.  It is very easy to load, set up and use....  everything that I needed was in the box. I speak with a slight accent, and it still works so smoothly. This is an invaluable tool for people at risk from carpal tunnel syndrome, for those who have difficulty using a keyboard efficiently, or for avoiding the fatigue of preparing large reports. It is so simple that you can speak out ideas and visualize them in print before deciding what to do next.  Great for doing e-mail...  all this and you can continue using the keyboard as you wish. I love it!",0

"Jane Stuart, literary agent, meets with her client Nate Barre and Tina Vale, publisher of Corsair Books.  Unfortunately Tina wants to make Jane pay.  She chooses to do it by canceling Nate's million-dollar contract.  Apparently, Jane's husband (now deceased) was Tina's lover before they married.  Jane never knew about it.  Tina never got over it.Tina is in town to get an award at the Romance Authors Together (RAT) convention.  Tina fails to show up and is found dead in her bath.  It appears she committed suicide.  She was electrocuted with one of her prized antique toasters.  A note was found.At the same time, there is a cat show at the same Inn.  Jane's son Nicholas and nanny Florence are there showing their housecat Winky.  Jane makes an appearance to see how they're doing.  Things aren't going very well.Plus the RATs and the cats are not getting along well.  Detecive Stanley Greenberg, Jane's boyfriend, has to keep an eye on things and help settle any disputes.Jane does not believe Tina committed suicide.  Stanley finally acknowledges that it appears to have been murder.  Bad part is that Jane is one of the suspects.  Fearing this would ruin her business reputation, she decides to try to find the killer before word gets out that she's a suspect.  She enlists her assistant, Daniel.  They begin interviewing the various parties.Shelly Adams, Tina's assistant, meets with Jane to provide information about Tina.  As Jane gets deeper into investigating, she finds herself in danger.  Can she find out who killed Tina without ending up another victim?This is the first book I've read in this delightful series.  It definitely won't be the last.  They have a new fan.  Jane is such a likeable character.  She is the type of person you would want to get to know.  She is able to stumble onto information in a believable manner.  Her literary contacts really helped in this story.  Her relationships with the other characters were well written and believable.  I highly recommend this book.",1
"If you are interested in learning the &quot;craft&quot; of investing,  Train's masterwork on the subject has got to be the place to begin. Train  offers to the reader the tried and true wisdom of the greatest investors of  all time: not the speculative or newfangled theories that manefest  themselves on the bookshelves all too often. Train's chapters on growth  investing and value investing are timeless, and his brilliant (and funny!)  chapter on the psyche of investors through the market's cycle is entirely  compelling. I have read hundreds of similar books, yet this is one of the  few that I return to year after year, and recommend to friends and clients  weekly",1
"""Close to you, I will always stayClose to you, though you're far awayYou'll always be near As though you were here by my sideNo matter where - in my dreams I'll find you thereClose to me, sharing your caressCan't you see you're my happiness?Wherever you go, my heart will go, tooWhat can I do?It only wants to be close to you."" ~ Close To You ~ Al Hoffman/Carl Lampl/Jerry Livingston""Close To You And More,"" recorded in 1956, is one of the finest and my absolute favorite Sinatra recordings of all-time. The choice of material is very impressive and his interpretations are flawless, heartfelt, sincere and so true to the lyrics of each song. This is another one of great collaborations with a fine arranger and conductor, Nelson Riddle. To me, Nelson Riddle was truly the best of all Sinatra arrangers/conductors for he had proved that he could master his craft on any recordings he handled, be it with a full orchestra or a small ensemble like the classically-influenced Hollywood String Quartet (husband and wife Felix and Eleonor Slatkin, Paul C. Shure and Alvin Dinkin). Mr. Sinatra, a classical music lover himself, heard the beauty and elegance on how the quartet played and fell in love with the quartet and in the process developed a close friendship with the Slatkins.With fifteen nostalgic songs to listen to, this magnificent CD is bound to mesmerize and move you starting off with my top choice here, an achingly beautiful song, ""Close To You"" followed by one of Johnny Mercer and Gordon Jenkin's gems, a longingly sentimental ""P.S. I Love You,"" down to  heart-rending tracks, Jimmy McHugh and Harold Adamson's ""I Couldn't Sleep A Wink Last Night"" and Edward Redding's ""The End of a Love Affair.""Mr. Sinatra's gentle and affectionate treatments of Edward Heyman and Oscar Levant's ""Blame It On My Youth"" and a gem from Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, ""It's Easy To Remember"" are so sublime and perfectly covered. ""Your sweet expressionThe smile you gave meThe way you looked when we metIt's easy to rememberBut so hard to forgetI hear you whisper, ""I'll always love you"" I know it's over and yetIt's easy to rememberBut so hard to forget.""Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin's musical treasure, ""With Every Breathe I Take"" is also one of my favorite songs of all-time. ""I think of you with every breath I takeWith every breeze that wanders byAnd your name is a songI'll remember the long years through.""And yes. . . Frank Sinatra is like a song, a song we'll always remember the long years through.With my heartfelt recommendation. A must-have to any Sinatra buff. ",0
"Well written, well researched, mesmerizing!  There are not enough words to praise this book.  It covers every aspect and type of life a woman could lead when she came West.  It takes information from diaries and eyewitness  accounts.  It will make you realize that human feelings don't change.  We  can all relate to what these women felt.  It doesn't read like a history  book, it reads like a magnificent saga.  I couldn't put it down",1

"""London Calling"" is one of the most emotionally wrenching YA books I've had the pleasure to read in the past year.  The character of Martin (JMartinC is his IM username) is as real as any kid I've run into recently.  Yes, there is time-travel of a sort.  Martin is somehow transported to the past through the agency of an ancient Philco Radio, and Jimmy, his raggedy companion in World War II London, is a masterful, albeit tragic, character.Martin, of course, would rather this whole thing be a dream, because the alternative seems to be insanity.  But when his ""dreams"" start giving him historically accurate answers about things he's never heard of, then all bets are off.""What did YOU do to help?"" -- The question that reverberates through this marvelous is answered for Jimmy and Martin.  Could it be answered for the reader?Sorry for what seems like an excess of superlatives, but this is a superlative book",1

"I have read this book aloud to my first and second grade students for years.  It is an excellent story, well told, with all the realities of a different culture in a different situation than USA children.  However, it is painted with the strokes of deepest, realistic love that a family can have.  This is a great story to teach and talk about the struggles of families everywhere, the world and it's differences, and the importance of character ""no matter what"".  It is the book my second graders yearn to read on their own and therefore is a super motivator.  It is rich in geography",1
"This book give the steps to eliminate many common types of pain (headaches, back pain, arthritis, neuropathic pain, abdominal pains, carpal tunnel, etc.).  I was pleased to see the emphasis on sleep, dealing with hormonal issues, and nutrition.I'd never thought about something like ginger for reducing arthritis inflammation.  It can be added to a number of foods or even make a tea of it.  Curry powder (with its tumeric) and cherry extract are other pain relieving herbals.

"this album is exceptional for YLT.  I often flounder between this one and 'and then nothing' being my favorites, but they are different.  the variety of the songs is great but they all work together as a cohesive album, skipping tracks on this CD is completely unneccessary.  there are still some great love songs and a post-punk tunes but this album is more lyrically and instrumentally mature then some of thier earlier works, such as 'Painful' or 'Electropura'.

For example entropy.  The authors are leading researchers in the field and they brought a unique perspective to the subject; the writing is very lucid",1

"[This review is based on my copy published in 1994 by Ballantine. The cover is identical to this current re-print. ]For parents of adolescent girls, young adult women, as well as women of any age who have felt low self esteem, this book brings pivotal insight to help unravel the downward spiral of depression, poor self-image, and transform it into positive, life renewing attitudes. There is a quote on page 256 that I happened to have flagged years ago, so I hope you find this useful in your decision to buy this most important book. ""Maturity involves being honest and true to oneself, making decisions based on a conscious internal process, assuming responsibility for one's decisions, having healthy relationships with others and developing one's own true gifts. It involves thinking about one's environment and deciding what one will and won't accept"" (I cannot stress enough how important the above is!) Towards the bottom of the same page, here I think you will understand more about why I feel so strongly about this book for the well being of adolescent girls: (quote) ""Making conscious choices is also part of defining a self. I encourage girls to take responsibility for their own lives. Decisions need to be made slowly and carefully. Parents, boyfriends and peers may influence their decisions, but the final decisions are their own. The bottom line question is: ""Does this decision keep you on the course you want to be on?""""I applaud Mary Phipher, Ph.D. for making such an important contribution to humanity!

"I don't remember the last time I enjoyed a book so much.  From the first paragraph, I was captured by the characters, the setting, the message.   I love tales of ships and the sea, and the story of Lieutenant Marchand and the Confederate Naval Cadets' perilous voyage along the Southern coast held me spellbound.  But that's just the beginning of the appeal of Thomas Moore's novel.  I love stories of the South, as well, and now ""The Hunt for Confederate Gold"" will be listed among my favorites.The ordeal of Dr. Hastie at the hands of out-of-control federal authorities is not at all farfetched, and his story is a warning that people who cherish liberty should not ignore.  But this sobering message does not overpower the sheer enjoyability of the book.  The characterization is excellent.  The protagonists -- Hastie, ""Bo"" Bolitho, and members of the Fellowship of the South -- are genial fellows, good and true without being sappy.  And the federal villians aren't cardboard cutouts of evil, but flesh and blood men caught between negative Zietgeist and their own ambition, which can be a deadly combination, as history demonstrates.Taking place in fabled South Carolina, and entwined with a riveting parallel story set in the last days of the Confederate States of America, Moore's story is a completely satisfying read.  I highly recommend it. ",1
A Great Book! You can have something from it much more than you wonder,1
"For almost 15 years, the most popular dish I've served to friends and taken to potlucks has been one cut from a magazine and attributed to Cafe Flora.  Knowing this dish appealed to both vegetarians and non, I would periodically check to see if there was an entire Cafe Flora cookbook ""out there"".  Then, just before a spate of seasonal visitors were scheduled to descend, I googled up what is now my most used and reliable partner in terms of taste, nutrition and dependable results.  I ended up amazoning another one to a vegetarian family member who, like me, is always trying to bridge the tastebuds of meateaters and veggers.   And, the recipes are FUN to make",1

"Anne Carson had me hooked on this book within moments of reading the introduction.  Her commitment to parenting, and to discovering her own path toward spiritual connectedness and understanding, is both moving and  inspiring.  This book is not designed to tell you how to raise your child  in a spiritual home, but the collected essays are meant to inspire thought  on the nature of spirtuality and what beliefs each parent may wish to  impart.  The different section headings, from the spirituality of  conception and parenthood to early infancy and on through late adolescence,  make this book relevant to people of all ages.  Even if you don't have  children, it is a wonderful resource for building community and for  learning to share our spiritual beliefs in a space of connectedness and  understanding.  I find myself recalling specific passages time and again,  and am often deeply moved by the philosophies and thoughts presented by the  many essayists.  The religious and spiritual ideas presented are varied and  rich in their diversity, and the ideas for creating personal celebrations  and rituals are inspiring.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  It  will change the way you view spirituality and parenting a new soul",1
"This is a reasonably-priced, excellent reference book. The encyclopedia has a half-page essay for each year from 1901-2005, individual stats grouped by year and team, career stats, annual leaders, active leaders as of 2006, and much more. This is the 25rd edition of a classic which provides all the essentials of 20th and 21st century baseball in a managable size and easy-to-use format. Here are some things I particularly liked: * Article summaries of each season. * Separate articles for the postseason starting in 1998 * The player statistics are organized by year and team, a very useful alternative to Total Baseball. * Reasonable price. Here are some things I wish were different: * The 19th century is barely acknowledged. * On-base average is not included, a major omission. * The All-star Game are not included. This book is not nearly as comprehesive as Total Baseball, but delivers the essentials at less than half the cost",1
"Rainbow boys is a book about three different teenage boys going through high school. The only difference about them that separates them from general society is that they're gay. Jason, a confused teenager not sure about his sexuality, attends a rainbow youth meeting in hopes of getting more knowledge about the gay scene. But, unexpectedly he runs into Nelson and Kyle, two other boys that attend the same high school as him. The two are shocked to see that the star jock player would be attending a gay youth meeting.  However, Nelson admits that he assumed he was gay or at least bisexual from the beginning. Kyle is excited because for the last three years, he's had a heart ache for Jason. With this new opening chance, the three now have an opportunity to deal through the struggles of being gay together.The only problem is, Nelson loves Kyle (his best friend), but Kyle loves Jason. Whiles Jason is still confused. This love triangle brings on jealousy and further confusion that only makes their life more difficult. Not only do they have to try and have society accept them more, but they have to go on and have their own family accept their decisions. I'm glad to have read this book, it's very addicting and I could never put it down till the end. What is even greater is that it is part of a series and there are more after this. So keep your eyes open to read the next two. This book not only educates you more about the difficulties teenage gays go through, but it opens your mind up to really accept sexual differences and becoming content you're your own, whatever that may be.",1

"Previous reviewers who have complained that there is no bibliography or citations should note that the author states repeatedly throughout the book that everything (except the quotes from other people) he writes about is drawn from his own personal experience as a psychic vampire and a shaman. This is not an academic treatise or a theoretical guide; this is a book by someone who has found out through trial and error how to control his own vampiric tendencies, and who gives good, thoughtful advice about how to deal with such tendencies in oneself or one's child, in an ethical and non-abusive way. There is no bibliography of references because the author's primary source was himself and those whom he interviewed.That being said...I am not a psychic vampire myself, but I do deal with energy work quite a bit, and I think anybody who does as well should probably read this book. Even if you yourself are not a vampire, whether you're a magician, witch, shaman or whatever, you're probably going to run into one of these folks at some point, if you haven't already. Most of them probably aren't even aware of what they're doing. Rather than shunning them and screeching about how evil they are, why not show them this book and try to help them understand themselves better? It can't hurt to be accepting and understanding if you're in a position to help someone",1
"Brian Tracy is one of the best motivation speakers out there, and this is one of his best programs. And at $20 for six compact discs, it's one of his best values, too. Six hours of Brian Tracy telling you that you can get what you want and do what you dream is enough to get anybody fired up and ready to go. More than just motivation, though, this program is packed with practical suggestions on what to do and how to do it. I especially liked the seven ways to develop my intelligence and the four questions to ask myself to know if I'm doing a good job. And now that I understand what a waste of time it is to worry about money, I can see how much more energy I have to devote to creating my financial independence. Believe in yourself enough to listen to Brian Tracy, and he'll  put it all within your reach",1
I am not in the field of psychology and was intrigued to learn  the extent psychologists have gone through devoting their lives to find answers to the human condition. It is extremely rare that I read a book from front to back and return to review it. Lauren Slater writes to the reader in a simple way sharing many points of view and demonstrating her respect and compassion for life. Her attention to detail exemplifies how much her heart was put into this book while working diligently to remain objective and factual. She includes the observations made by the psychological community causing the reader to question the validity of experimentation because what may appear obvious is often open to question with valid opposing points of view from the psychological community; a very difficult feat. I look forward to reading it again,1

"This book does not stray an inch from the usual 'Raising Daughters: For Dumb***es' formula, which consists of the following:1) Pop-science involving the brain and hormones is used to 'confirm' the most banal stereotypes about females.  If you've heard the ones about how they are supposedly all more 'empathetic' and 'relational' than males, you have heard the basic premise of this book.  The author even mentions something about how she believes that stereotypes 'usually hold truth'.*2) The sort of trite parenting advice that was once called 'common sense' but is now called 'marketable'.  Plenty of tiresome and unenlightening 'real-world examples' are used as padding to make up for the book's lack of anything that can be called substance.* Indeed -- but only if one doesn't bother to look any further.In short: don't be a sucker.  Hopefully this review will be of help",1

Michael Seeley is a complicated and realistic character - very talented and deeply flawed.  Seeley's client, a media conglomerate, is desperate, manipulative and dangerous.  The book is very smartly plotted, and an unusual and entertaining mix of history (Hollywood blacklist), artists' rights, and copyright law.  The writing evokes a strong sense of time and place.  I finished the book hoping that there is a sequel, if only to resolve some of the unanswered questions about Seeley's future",1

"Author Robert Scott had much the same the experience at Salisbury Cathedral as I had - a sense of awe and wonder, and a desire to learn more about it, not just as a place, or as an architectural wonder, or as a place of worship, or as a cultural icon.  Scott wanted to get at the heart of the idea of the Gothic enterprise as a whole - a trained sociologist, Scott knew that the bigger picture is sometimes lost by too narrow a focus on particular details to the exclusion of others.  The sociology background also gave Scott a sense of wanting to understand the hearts and minds of the people involved.  While the principal focus of Scott's travels started with Salisbury Cathedral (in full, the Cathedral Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary at Salisbury), Scott draws examples from the breadth of the Gothic cathedrals, churches and other buildings.  There are literally thousands of such dotted across the European and European-influenced landscapes.  Each building has its own unique characteristics, but they share a common spirit.  Church building in particular was 'big business' in Christendom for a long time.  Scott quotes estimates of that there are nearly 19,000 ecclesiastical buildings in England and Wales, nearly half of which date to the medieval period.  The first Gothic church was the Abbey Church of St. Denis, just north of Paris, built under the direction of the 'founding father' of Gothic style, Abbot Suger.  Scott's first major section looks at how cathedrals were built, in terms of materials, architectural design, settings, and workforce.  With regard to the workforce, the numbers were large and the division of labour highly specialised.  In the records of the construction of Westminster Abbey, there were fifteen different categories of workers listed in 1253.  Workers were often local, but supplemented by those who traveled, particularly if special skills were needed.  Construction was often suspended in winter months, not just because of the cold, but because the number of daylight hours greatly diminished (in England, there can be fewer than 8 hours of daylight in the winter months).  Scott's second major section explores the history involved.  The Gothic enterprise grew up out of the feudal system as it was trying to define itself in a sea of shifting political structures. It is no mistake that the Gothic ideal was born in an Abbey rather than a Cathedral; bishops had become increasingly involved in secular and political matters, while the monasteries remained closer to the common people and closer to the spiritual ideals of the church.  'Monasticism was a continuous effort to surmount sense perception and intellectual understanding to achieve knowledge of God, to experience communion with God, and by so doing to reveal the divine mystery and achieve special favour in the eyes of God.'  Still, the particular abbey of Gothic's foundation, the Abbey of St. Denis, had a particular attachment to the French monarchs, and for a time the Abbey enjoyed a supreme reputation, 'from 1124 onward the Abbey Church of St. Denis became the religious and, in an important sense, the political capital of France.'  From this place, the influence of Gothic style spread through the Paris region, then outward into France and beyond.  In the third section, Scott highlights some of the classic details of what the Gothic look entails.  There is a geometric symmetry involved, which, 'when followed consistently, gives Gothic cathedrals their characteristic organic unity.'  There is a logic and harmony built into the design.  High vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, pointed arches are other features.  However, the key element in Gothic design is light, and it is in aid of this aspect that the other elements are enlisted.  Gothic cathedrals in comparison with the dimly lit Romanesque predecessors are flooded with light.  Be it clear or stained glass, the incorporation of windows and lighting techniques hitherto not done makes the Gothic space a brighter surrounding.  Heaven would be a place of light, and the Gothic cathedral is intended as a foretaste of the heavenly banquet.The fourth section explores the religious experience in Gothic structures, and how liturgies and worship are carried out, how they serve as temples of the imagination in addition to being the centre of worship, and how they become a repository of history.  Part of this history was the incorporation of the memory and power of the dead into the fabric of the cathedrals - many became pilgrimage sites or burial sites; royal and other notable society figures also became part of the structures of cathedrals and churches.  According to Scott, the cathedrals provided the saints with a focal point of veneration, and the saints in return provided a steady income (from the pilgrims) for the buildings to be completed.The final section looks at the community that surrounded the Gothic enterprise, be they parish churches, abbey churches or cathedrals.  Scott explores the living standards of the time, the stratification and specialisation of people in the different roles in society, and the questions not only of how the communities built the churches, but how the churches and cathedrals in turn built the communities.  'We might ...imagine that the long time required to build Gothic cathedrals added to the depth of the collective identity they engendered.'  Indeed, in some regards, the building of a cathedral was never supposed to be completed.  Spanning generations (sometimes, as in the case of Canterbury Cathedral, nearly 400 years) such enterprises defined the community in ways that no building project in modern times could approach.  Scott ends with a small essay regarding Stonehenge, not too far from Salisbury Cathedral, showing some similarities and differences in the way people built and found identity then.  Scott quotes Samuel Johnson as declaring Salisbury Cathedral 'the last perfection in architecture'; however, it is clear that there is much perfection to go around when it comes to all things Gothic.  Scott's passion for the material and love of discovery is apparent on every page.  A good writer, he serves as teacher, tour guide, and co-discoverer of ideas with the reader.  This is a wonderful book.",1
"First off, I love Eddie Murphy.  In my opinion, he's one of the more brilliant talents to come out of SNL.  But it's a crying shame that sketches that were included on the original VHS version of ""Eddie Murphy: Best of SNL"" have been deleted from the DVD version.  My particular favorite piece (Eddie playing a rastafarian singing ""we're gonna kill da white people"" at a meeting of mostly white VFW members) is NOT on this DVD along with a number of others.  Have the SNL folks suddenly become squeamish and politically correct - I can only assume that such cowardice and overly correct behavior is at the root of such an obvious ommission.  After having owned the VHS version, I can honestly say that I regret having purchased the DVD.  I would return it if I could.  Listen to the other viewers and don't be fooled",0

"As a school social worker I'm using this book to talk to a predominantly African-American 1st grade class who is having problems with teasing due to being too light or too dark. After I read the book I have them hold up  their pointer finger and pretend it's a crayon. I tell them to scribble on  their desk with their crayon and then look at the scribbles of the kids  around them. The color that is produced is the color of their skin. They  see that none of the shades are exactly the same, and that leads into a  discussion of why we treat people differently due to skin color. It puts a  somewhat complex concept into simple terms and is a delight to read. Kids  love it",1
"Roberto Rossellini is one of the most influencial figure in film history.  A few of his films changed the way movies are made. Open City and Paisan  shocked the world. Voyage in Italy changed the lives of many filmmakers,  from Jean-Luc Godard to Martin Scorsese. Yet, no serious study was done  about his entire body of work, before this book. Rosselini is a mysterious  figure. His style changes from a decade to another. Also, many of his  films, like Vanina Vanini or Blaze Pascal, are rarely screened. His carrer  is also sort of tarnished because of his affair and marriage with Ingrid  Bergman. In fact, most f not-so-serious movie fans know his name as only  the guy who brought her to Italy. The truth is, they made some of the most  beautiful films in film history: Voyage in Italy, Stromboli, Europe 1951...  Gallagher, who is also known with his magnificent work about John Ford,  applied the same tactics to write about Rossellini: to carefully study each  film, from shot to shot. It is an impressive book. It takes a lot of time  to read, perhaps, but not aslong as the author took to write (20 years).  His argument is sober and careful, yet you can feel the passion behind it,  just as you can feel from the later works of Rossellini himself. In  studying each film with great attention, the author finds out, and explains  to us, that in spite of the differences in their appearance, there is a  single, unique, coherent style, logic, and genius behind this impressive  body of works. It is one of the most impressive book about cinema. One  regretable thing is that, most of the films disscussed in this book, we  can't see them",1
"Brigitte Sassen (ed.), in Kant's Early Critics: The Empiricist Critique of the Theoretical Philosophy, freshly translates and thematically organizes the reactions of Kant's contemporaries to the first edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1781) and, thus, renders a considerable service to students of European thought in the eighteenth century.  Using articles written between 1781 and 1789 by Jacobi, Feder, Tiedemann, and other eighteenth century commentators, Sassen (McMaster University) makes it rather easy to follow the complex polemics on space, time, logic, empiricism, idealism, and Kant's critical philosophy in general.   Although somewhat forgotten today, these debates and discussions are of great historical importance because they led directly to some of the crucial revisions in the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason.   This collection of articles and essays forms a companion edition to the Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant. Less advanced readers will be helped by biographical notes, a very simple German-English glossary, and a short but useful bibliography.  This book will be very useful to any reader interested in the ideas of the Enlightenment and encourage students and professors from many disciplines to revisit this important chapter in European intellectual history",1
"The production of this DVD absolutely sparkles.  I have a 6 and a 10 year old, and they have watched this video, and learned many of the moves. They are pretty good!  They film the steps that you take for the moves from beneath the player, through a plexiglass floor! They also show pro players using these moves in a game.  It's also a bonus that one of the most prolific goal scorers in the English Premier League, Ruud Von Nistlerooy, is showing several of the moves along with some very talented 10 year old soccer players.  It's also surprizing how many Manchester United players shown in this DVD have also scored goals for their respective countries in the FIFA World Cup. In short, why not learn some terrific moves going from basic to advanced from some of the best players in the world?  There is not a better instructional DVD.  ",0

With all the heros, it is amazing that Waid and Ross were able to satisfy so many fans and it is a testament that this graphic novel has withstood over ten years, being reformatted into new collector editions every few years.The last section of the book is filled with notes, Alex's sketches and a message from his father, whom Norman McCay is loosely based on (as well as he was the model for the character).This is a superior collector's edition",1

"France's work is certainly the best military history of the 1st Crusade in print.  Contrary to popular belief, many nobles of the First Crusade did indeed have experience leading and/or fighting in organized, well led military ventures in Europe.  Robert of Normandy and Robert of Flanders were both experienced campaigners.  Duke Godfrey of Boullion was at the great Siege of Rome, and Bohemond of Taranto (clearly the Crusade's most able tactician) had long experience fighting against his Guiscard relatives and the Byzantines in the Balkans.  France admirably refutes any idea that the 1st Crusade was simply a horde of fanatical barbarians.  He does a fine job of explaining how relatively large-scale logistics and planning were skills that a number of nobles brought with them to the East.  In fact, the ultimate success of the venture could not have happened without such expertise.  Understanding this fact helps the student realize that the 1st Crusade's success cannot be entirely attributed to (a) religious fanaticism, (b) Islamic divisions, or (c) luck (all of which many past historians have subscribed).  Certainly, all 3 of the above were factors, but none of them can fully explain the amazing success of the late 11th century European knights in Turkey, Syia, and Palestine.  As France explains, martial skills conquered the Holy Land.  Other considerations, from a military perspective, are peripheral.  The religious fanaticism of the crusaders certainly helped them in their conquests (defeat of Kerbogha, especially), but such fanaticism couldn't defeat an enemy alone.  After all, the People's Crusade (1096) of Peter the Hermit had equal fanaticism, and it was cut to pieces almost as soon as it stepped on Turkish soil.  By the same token, Islamic political divisions after the death of Malik Shah certainly contributed to the Crusade's success.  However, even with such divisions, the Crusaders were at huge numerical and/or resource disadvantages against their Islamic opponents.  After all, the Crusaders were often outnumbered, were fighting thousands of miles from home on unfamiliar terrain, and had virtually no supply line.  It took leadership and force of arms for such wondrous military achievements to take place.France does about as good a job of analyzing the military decisions and actions of the Crusaders as I have read.  He covers in detail all of the major clashes (along with many minor ones) with Islamic powers: Nicea, Dorylaem, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Ascalon.  Battle tactics and strategy are well covered, maps are understandable and relevant, and results are clearly explained.  France, like other historians, recognizes that the European's greatest asset was the heavily mailed charge.  The Crusaders were rather more heavily armoured than their Islamic adversaries, and the charge was a devastating weapon.  However, the heavily armoured charge was in somewhat of an embryonic stage in the late 11th century and certainly wasn't yet what it would be come in the 12th and 13th centuries.  Because it was a relatively new innovation, it took quite exquisite leadership and martial ability to use it effectively.  It took even better generalship to coordinate the cavalry with the infantry.  One of the greatest strengths of France's work is his coverage of how these skilled soldiers (Bohemond in particular) were able to link cavalry actions with infantry actions and how the Crusaders quickly and continually learned these lessons after encountering the Turks' alien fighting style.  The lightly armed Turks presented the Crusaders with an opponent that they had not seen before.  They were highly mobile and fought primarily from the saddle with a composite bow.  Their tactics frequently involved encirclement and feigned retreat.  These were tactics, in fact, that troubled European knights for 200 years in the Holy Land.  Still, the 1st Crusaders were able to modify their own tactics enough to clear the way of Turks on their way to Jerusalem.  Again, such adaptation shows just how militarily sophisticated and skilled these Western ""barbarians"" really were.  Again, a strength of France's work.On the negative side, there was not enough comparative study of the weapons available to Christian and Islamic armies.  We are told that the Europeans were rather more heavily armoured than their Islamic opponents and that they typically carried far heavier lances.  However, there is no detailed discussion of these issues.  Short mention is made of mail and lamellar, and very little comment is made about relative hand weapon size/construction/type/etc.  That said, France certainly does not believe that military technology was a decisive factor in the Crusade's success.  Hence, he can't be faulted too much for not including information not relevant to his thesis especially when he considers technological differences to be either non-decisive or negligible.  France also tends to get ahead of himself in parts of the work which may cause some to question its focus.  The work reads fairly chronologically but will at times go into tangents covering events which are not yet put into context.  The problem is not serious, though, and does not affect the quality of the work.This is the premier military history of the First Crusade, and its value cannot be overestimated.  It certainly deserves to be on the shelf with R.C. Smail's classic ""Crusading Warfare: 1097-1193"" and Christopher Marshall's ""Warfare in the Latin East: 1192-1291).  Other valuable works, while not about the Crusades specifically, are France's other great work ""Western Warfare in the Age of the Crusades"", Maurice Keen's ""Medieval Warfare: A History"", Charles Oman's ""The Art of Warfare in the Middle Ages"", and especially J.F. Verbruggen's ""The Art of Warfare in Western Europe during the Middle Ages from the Eighth Century"".  A number of other works about the First Crusade specifically are extremely valuable in that they cover far more than just the military aspect. See, for example, Thomas Asbridge's new ""The First Crusade: A New History"", Runciman's dated but still valuable ""The First Crusade"", and Jonathon Riley-Smith's ""The Crusade and the Idea of Crusading"".  I don't agree with some of his ideas, but David Nicolle has written some valuable works such as ""The First Crusade 1096-1099: Conquest of the Holy Land"".  There exists a large number of quality general histories of the Crusades as a whole.  Anything by Riley-Smith is excellent.  Without naming too many, Jean Richard's ""The Crusades c. 1071-1291"", Hans Eberhard Mayer's ""The Crusades"", and Robert Payne's ""The Dream and the Tomb: A History of the Crusades"" are all valuable resources as well",1

"""Second Guessing God"" by Brian Jones shows how to live a purpose driven life rather than tell how in ""The Purpose Driven Life"" by Rick Warren. Not that I am knocking Rick. However I read Rick's book just prior to Brian's. When reading ""Purpose Driven"" my wife got mad at me because I would leave her to go downstairs to read in the quiet. With ""Second Guessing God"" it didn't matter what else was on because it was so engaging. The detailed and funny stories have a purpose and have me wanting to do more to serve God.  I am not sure the title ""Second Guessing God"" has the pizazz this book deserves. The humble but upbeat style makes this book very engaging.

I have had no trouble at all with the SanDisk.  It comes with an armband, and plastic protective case to prevent the screen from getting scratched.

"New York, N.Y.: Jul 23, 1972.Republic Or Empire; American Resistance to the Philippine War. By Daniel B. Schirmer. Preface by Howard Zinn. 298 ppThe anti-imperialists of 1898 to 1904, long ignored, have been honored as prophets within the past several years by protesters seeking withdrawal from Vietnam. The anti-imperialist's' protests against military coercion of far-off dark-skinned peoples and their warnings against the perils and iniquities of empire have acquired a new cogency. Schirmer's is one of several full scale studies to appear since Americans became involved in Vietnam-and, although his New Left interpretations (fro the most part) follow a familiar outline, his is one of the most thoughtful and interesting of the accounts.  The main thrust is an economic determinism that is by no means an innovation of the New Left, since it represents pretty much the ideology of the anti-imperialists themselves-and of American protestors against involvement in war an overseas interventions throughout the 1920's and 1930's.Schirmer sees a line of aggressive development in American history that runs from the early settlers wrestling land from the Indians to the present venture in Southeast Asia, and a second line of opposition.  But he confines himself to events from the 1880's into the early 1900's, focusing on the Philippine insurrection.  In these events there are parallels to the Vietnam war and also striking differences; Schirmer's book should be read as a historical interpretation of the anti-imperialist movement, not as a parable of present-day troubles.Yet the theme of Americans' revulsion to wars is as persistent as that of their involvement in them.  To this Schirmer adds the debatable postulate that involvement was primarily for economic gain.  Illustrative of his views and the contents of the book is a speech that Morfield Storey, who was to be the prime mover in the anti-imperialist movement, delivered before the Massachusetts Reform Club on the ever of the Spanish-American War: ""Some represented in high Federal office think that war will improve business and increase the gains of the rich. I can't refrain from quoting the reply which was made to one of these last week by a Middlesex Yankee of pure blood.  He was a manufacturer of woolen goods, and a dealer in wool said to him, `We want war. Just think of how it will raise the price of wool, and how it will sever to send your good up.' `Yes,'  was the answer, `but think how much more the dye stuff will cost.  I can't afford to dye my goods in American blood. It comes to high.'""Storey warned that the war would be a turning point in American development-for, with victory, ""we should be fairly launched upon a policy of military aggression, of territorial expansion, of standing armies and growing navies...inconsistent with the continuance of our institutions.""  When the war did turn into a quick rout of Spain and offer opportunities for the United States to acquire colonies, Storey and likeminded leaders organized the American Anti-Imperialist League.  First, it fought against the treaty of acquisition with Spain.  Then, in the election of 1900, it allied itself with William Jennings Bryan and workingmen to try and defeat the McKinley Administration.  Nut McKinley secured ratification of the treaty-and in 1900, with the slogan of the ""full dinner pail"" routed Bryan and the anti-imperialists. The final stand of the anti-imperialists was against the cruel subjugation of the insurgents and unfriendly villages during the drawn-out Philippine insurrection-a far bloodier and more costly struggle than the Spanish-American War.  In this instance their publicizing of atrocities did much to bring reform within the military establishment, but not the relinquishment, until a generation later, of the Philippines.  They also succeeded in turning American feelings against further territorial acquisitions. Secretary of State John Hay told a friend in the spring of 1900 that public opinion would not stand for annexation of territory in China.  Schirmer says the shift was only one ""from outright colonialism to indirect forms of political domination, accompanied by economic penetration, and, on occasion, by military intervention.""What distinguishes Schirmer's interpretation is the emphasis he places upon the role of racism in the imperialist thrust, and the interrelationship between the maintenance of white supremacy in the South and the domination of dark-skinned people in the Hawaiian Islands and the Philippines.  Anti-imperialists were striking at their racism as much as at military and economic exploitations.  He points out, as have others, that the anti-imperialist leaders-predominantly Bostonians-were elderly survivors of the abolitionist movement; Storey had been secretary to the abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner.  He might have added that after the waning of anti-imperialism, Storey helped mount the N.A.A.C.P. fight in the courts to win bit-by-bit equality under the law for black people.The imperialist ventures coincided with a new wave of state legislation and mob action throughout the South to block Negroes from the polls. In the election of 1898, more than a score of North Carolina blacks were killed, and four more lynched. The ant-imperialists Boston Advertiser declared, ""The white man's government of the North Carolina pattern is precisely the government which so-called expansionists hope to put in operation... in the Philippines.""  And the imperialist Memphis Commercial Appeal Agreed: ""How are we going to govern the Philippines, Hawaii, and other new possessions? Peaceably if we can; or like the white men are doing in the Carolinas, if we must, but govern them we will.""Negro leaders, protesting against both lynchings and imperialism charged that McKinley was seeking Southern support for his acquisitions by dropping the traditional Republican gestures toward Negro rights.  Archibald H. Grimke joined other prominent Boston lawyers in urging Negroes to vote against the party of Lincoln: ""Scratch the skin of Republican leaders like Hanna, Lodge, Roosevelt and McKinley and you will find race prejudice underneath, and invincible belief on their part in the divine right to the Anglo-Saxon to govern the republic and subject darker races.""  Further, the plutocracy unless checked, ""would ultimately convert the republic into an empire...into a government of by and for vast syndicates of wealth.""Despite the rather simplistic overall interpretation resulting from Schirmer's preoccupation with economic  factors, this is an important book.  It would have been even better if he had broken out of the confining mold of New Left history and ranged more widely in his examination of motivations and actions-particularly of the imperialist and their large following.",1

"I agree with every other reviewer here.  This album is uplifting, and inspiring, and a pure delight in every way.  I usually shy away from absolutes and realize that musical taste is subjective, but I really believe this is one of the finest pieces of music ever recorded, regardless of genre.This CD belongs in any serious library of music and will certainly win over the descriminating listener who may not be very familiar with African music.  A masterpiece!!",0
"A lot of American readers may be put off by the rather dryly literate writing style of this British writer, but I would urge them to stick it out for a deep and true read, with an ending that is uplifting, but as painful  and complex as life itself. As one who grew up with the benefit of an  idealistic liberal education and travelled the world widely and deeply, and  like the protoganists of this book found that the almost diefied third  world races are no less free of the capacity to do evil than white  westerners, this novel had a brave ring of truth. In fact, it is so against  the grain that I'm surprised it wasn't condemned by the liberal elites who  write most of the book reviews. A different view of the missionary  experience, as well as Mantel's classical prose and subtly unfolding plot  make an interesting antidote to the simplistically politically correct and  gimmickally narrated bestseller, Barbara Kinsolver's &quot;The Poisonwood  Bible.&quot; This is one of the few books I've read in recent years that  had something new and original to say",1

"Dr. Snow has a unique look on the supernatural world from a ""birds-eye"" view of her own personal near-death experience. From this, she came out from a strict religious background to a place of openness and spirituality, and brings the reader along with her like a best friend. Well-written, humorous at times, and light hearted, this author shows how the average person can develop the abilities for healing, finding missing children, etc. There are numerous personal accounts of her doing these things, and doing them well. Since she came into this ""new life"" from no previous background involved with the metaphysical, there is very little here that duplicates any other book, it is refreshing and insightful. I give it a big thumbs up.",1
"My interest in Reichen's book began a few weeeks ago after I saw an article saying that he and his boyfriend, former *NSYNC star Lance Bass, had received threats because of the book. It was all over the news. I picked up the book to see what all the fuss was about that would make people sink as low as to threaten another human being. What I found was an amazing story of hardship, courage, and self-discovery. Reichen details the intense training he had to endure in basic training as a student at the Air Force Academy. He also speaks of the struggles as he tried to come to terms with his sexuality. Most importantly, he speaks of the struggles he and fellow cadets faced as they tried to live a double life, one under the strict rules and code of the U.S. military and the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy and one as a gay American.  The courage they showed as they faced these challenges was very admirable. Kudos to you, Reichen. May you have a lifetime of true happiness..",1
"Charles R. Swindoll has been through a lot of tough stuff. As a pastor, college chancellor, radio host and author, he has experienced firsthand many of the troubles that life has to offer. From ""Anxiety"" to ""Temptation"" and from ""Confrontation"" to ""Shame,"" the fourteen topics he covers provide a model for the reader to use when life blindsides him. Thus it is with the authority that comes from experience that Dr. Swindoll generously offers to help those who are struggling with their own particular pile of tough stuff.GETTING THROUGH THE TOUGH STUFF explores two basic premises that are built on an underlying theme. First, if you are alive on this planet, you will have problems. The second premise is that God has provided us with the original self-help manual, the Bible. The underlying theme is the adequacy of God's love and grace to see us through even the toughest of stuff.Dr. Swindoll has the gift of knowledge when it comes to the Bible, and he deftly identifies the roots of our ""troubles"" as well as the solutions to them by referencing biblical stories and passages. In each short, focused chapter, even seasoned believers will wonder anew at the omniscience of God. He knew just what kind of problems we would face, how we would try to solve them according to the wisdom of the world, and how sadly we would fail. Then, as Dr. Swindoll demonstrates, God in His loving and benevolent way provided us with the wisdom of the ages if only we would use it --- not only when things get tough but even before they get tough.Often, when people have problems, they feel guilty and shamed or angry and resentful. But the problems themselves have been around since the beginning of time. And, more importantly, Jesus Himself experienced them. So when the Word of God offers answers, it can be trusted because the Word Himself did what His Father told Him to do...and it worked. We cannot be exactly like Jesus because, though He was tempted, He never sinned; often our problems are compounded because we do sin. Yet, through God's grace, the same solutions are available to us, and if we truly repent, we won't have to go through the same tough stuff again.GETTING THROUGH THE TOUGH STUFF is not a simple ""take two verses and call me in the morning"" book of platitudes. It provides biblical answers to contemporary problems in a loving and gentle way. Charles Swindoll is a man after God's own heart.   --- Reviewed by Maggie Harding, a substance abuse counselor in Phoenix, AZ who wanted to be Brenda Starr before life intervened.

"I enjoyed reading this book with my 8 year old daughter.  It is a very touching story about a family who lives on the move and does not have many of the things that families take for granted...like a real home, friends, the reassuring familiarity of school and daily routines.  It is a thought  provoking look at a very different sort of life.  I think it made my  daughter appreciate some of the things she just assumed that everyone has.   It's an advanced read. More of a book to read together as the words are  somewhat difficult and the storyline sometimes needs some explanation.  But  the characters are wonderful and good triumphs over evil in the end.  We  love a happy ending!  I'm sure we will read it often over the years",1

"I first purchased this book in 1972 and have re-read it many, many times.  Though I certainly do not agree with everything Commander Rockwell wrote, many of his observations and conclusions, though dated by time, still appear to be valid even today.  His concerns about the power and influence of organized Jewry and the dangers implicit in this power and influence ring bitterly true after events such as 9/11 and the invasion of Afganistan and Iraq where American foreign policy has been increasingly hijacked by pro-Israel 'neocons'.  In addition, his warnings about the violence and degeneracy of African-American culture and behaviour can be verified by simply turning on your radio and listening to the savagery, sexuality and baseness of so-called 'rap' and 'hiphop' music as well as by examining the barbarity and sexual promiscuity still found in the inner cities of Detroit, Washington, Los Angeles and New York.  The genius of Commander Rockwell's warnings and prognostications for the America of the foreseeable future are certainly to be taken to heart. ",1
"This book has been a wonderful way to introduce Ayurvedic cooking into my kitchen. I love the fact that these recipes are not ""indian"" dishes, for variety. I've tried the Salmon Loaf, Seafood cakes, beans & rice, and some very simple side dishes to go with these....all are great. I can also serve these to others who don't care to have indian food 7 days a week ;) As a beginner, I find most recipes in other, traditional Ayurvedic cooking sources a bit too much for my full-time work week, yet as an added benefit from using this cookbook I found that I've built up the courage to try those challenging ones as well... maybe on the weekend, initially. I base this review on comparison with the more complex ""Eat - Taste - Heal"", ""The New Whole Foods Encyclopedia"" (good  reference on Ayurvedic properties of single foods, but not on ""mixing""), and ""The Path of Practice"" (although this one is not really a cookbook). Hope my experience encourages you to try the Ayurvedic diet",1
"ok, I am (yes) a male and I have an interest in gender issues.  I happen to think that, just below the surface, our society has serious gender related ills.

This, I think, is needed--not reactionary, experiential nonsense!  And out with conservatives and their nineteenth-century-solutions!  The best of what our country is is based upon just the kind of careful rationalistic social solutions we find offered in Dr. Fineman's well-crafted book.  Thomas Jefferson would love this book.

"If you love meetings, then don't buy this book. If you don't like meetings, find them boring, intimidating, or incomprehensible; then definitely buy this book. Many young meetings goers stumbled over the original Robert's Rules and thought it was really not in English, contained no logic, and was like memorizing a phone book. Jennings actually makes learning how to run meetings fun. This book is as much about attitude as about rules.Jennings presents everything in a logical and entertaining fashion. After reading this book, reading Robert's Rules and using it appropriately as a reference becomes a cinch.Even if one's group is using Sturgis instead of Robert's, I still recommend any novice start with this book which is even more basic (and far more entertaining) than ""The Idiot's Guide"" or any other ""prep book"" for learning the Rules on how to run efficient meetings.

"In the first book of the series, ""Coyote,"" Allen Steele told us how the captain of the first interstellar colonizing ship, Alabama, smuggled prisoners-of-State (intellectual dissidents oppressed by a right-wing authoritarian government) on board, and they stole the ship, reached Coyote, a moon of a planet named Bear, circling 47 Ursae Majorus.  In ""Coyote Rising,"" things have gotten complicated.  On Earth, people are running out of living space, the government has shifted to a ""Collectivist"" (a variant of socialism) authoritarianism, and technology has advanced to produce ever-faster ships.  The result:  the original Coyote colonists get a series of unwelcome visitors from Earth, flee the original colony to form a new colony on a neighboring island, and a civil war begins to brew.As with the first book, this one originally appeared as a series of novellas in a science fiction magazine.  While there are still traces of disjointedness, from turning a series of novellas into a novel, the mild discontinuities did not interrupt the flow for me.  There is a larger cast of well-developed characters here, including the introduction of Savants (cyborgs with downloaded human minds) and a religious mutant.  The terrain of Coyote is well-described, as are the human interactions, and there is plenty of action.  The fauna of Coyote does not seem adequately developed (i.e., there should be more animal species).Thanks to the friend who sent this to me, Jan Dierckx, I found this book gripping and thoroughly enjoyable.

"This is the most important parenting book I have ever read. It goes far beyond outlining strategies for ""surviving parenthood"" and offers instead the insight and tools we all need to create a fulfilling lifestyle conducive to raising independent, loving and happy children (regardless of their differences). Through very specific examples drawn from raising twelve children of her own, her strong grounding in Montessori techniques and her Christian faith, Barbara has written a book that every mom will refer back to for as long as there are children in the house. She offers very realistic ideas on how to encourage our children to be independent, respectful, giving and creative. She outlines ways to help your child acknowledge and overcome ""bad habits"" or even situations that may not seem like they are in their control. She gives specific lists of age appropriate chores, as well as reading, movie materials and even family traditions that inspire and build strong values. This book reminds us of how truly blessed we are to have children and then provides us with the tools to make the absolute most of our parenting days.

"When you learn about the Original 13 Colonies the emphasis is always on Jamestown in Virginia, because it was first, Massachusetts Bay, because that is where the Pilgrims landed, and Pennsylvania, because that is where Ben Franklin ended up.  Georgia, as the southern most colony, receives scant attention and all you really learn is that it was settled by criminals.  But as Nancy Robinson Masters points out in this look as ""Georgia"" for the America the Beautiful, Second Series, it was not exactly criminals in the same sense that the English sent convicts to settle Australia, but more of a second chance for those who had ended up in debtor's prison.  Consequently, when young readers finish this book they are going to remember the name of James Edward Oglethorpe.Oglethorpe is introduced in Chapter One, ""A New Settlement,"" which explains why Georgia was named for King George II (the good one, not the bad one of the American Revolution who is King George III).  The next three chapters cover the history of Georgia, starting with Chapter Two, ""People and Pathways of the Past,"" which goes back to the original nomads who settled the area and then looks at the Cherokee and Creek native tribes, as well as the Spanish explorers, French Huguenots, and English settlers who arrived.  After laying out Oglethorpe's Grand Plan, the chapter ends with the American Revolution.  Chapter Three, ""Troubled Times,"" covers the Civil War and Sherman's March to the Sea along with Reconstruction.  Chapter Four, ""The Twentieth Century and Onward,"" starts with the Weevil War and ends with the story of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.Chapter Five of these books always looks at the geography of the state, but ""Natural Georgia"" is different because it does not look at the topographical divisions of the state, which, I admit, is one of the things I have been finding interesting about these books.  But Masters ends up doing that in Chapter Six, ""Highways and Byways,"" just to be different.  The politics of the state is covered in Chapter Seven, ""The Power of the People,"" which includes a look at some of the political leaders the state has produced, such as Jimmy Carter and Newt Gingrich.  This is also the chapter where you find out how ""Georgia on My Mind"" as sung by Ray Charles became the state song and the controversial history of Georgia's state flag.  The Georgia economy is covered in Chapter Eight, ""Progress and Prosperity,"" which is more than peanuts, cotton, and peaches.  In fact, Georgia is first in the nation in selling chickens.  Chapter Nine, ""The Many Faces of Georgia,"" looks at not just education and religion, but also integration.  Then in Chapter Ten, ""The Arts, Architecture, and Athletics,"" we find out about the writers (Margaret Mitchell, Flannery O'Connor, Alice Walker), musicians (Johnny Mercer, Jessye Norman), and athletes (Ty Cobb, Jackie Robinson, Mel Blount) the state has produced.As always, you will find a Timeline comparing U.S. and Georgia state history in the back of the book along with several pages of Fast Facts.  Then there is a list of books, organizations and Internet sites where you can to To Find Out More.  There are also lots of full-color photographs and original maps, along with the informative sidebars where young readers will find out some of the most interesting things about Georgia.  This includes people like the Revolutionary Heroine Nancy Morgan Hart and Eli Whitney the Father of Mass Production, things like the Colossal Fossil of a 40-million-year-old whale skeleton and a recipe for Peach Pie, and places like the mounds built by the Mississippians in Georgia.  Young readers will discover that for a place that was settled by ""criminals,"" a lot of impressive people came from Georgia, from Sequoyah and Stonewall Jackson to George Washington Carver and Ted Turner",1

"I read this book a few years ago, and have leafed through it many times since. I'm so glad Oprah's show will make it more visible. It's amazing how reading just a page or 2 can remind me to keep going with the ""work"" of happiness. Holden's idea that helps me most is that we sabotage ourselves so that we only reach a certain level of happiness, and then NO MORE because things will be TOO good. I've struggled with this my whole life: Don't get too happy about life, or then that cartoon anvil will drop onto your head because you pushed your luck. Lots of writers addressing happiness talk about positive thinking, etc. etc. That has never worked well for me. At least not for longer than a minute and half.  :)  But I found Robert Holden's explanations of how we get in our own way to be very understandable while at the same time serious enough to become a tool for pushing life up one big notch on the happy scale. It all sounds so simple, but like anything else, you have to be willing to pay attention, and change some old, stale habits that are doing nothing good in your life.Really helpful book for those who are looking for a fuller, more deeply satisfying life.",1
"Other than Pojar and MacKinnon's book and Cooke's wetland guide, this is the only general purpose, non-technical botanical books I'd recommend for the Pacific Northwest for wildflowers.  Over 1200 species are covered, including many of those in oft-ignored areas covered by other guides such as southern Oregon and the Wallowa/Blue Mountains.  Not every species is covered, of course, but chances are that if you see a plant growing somewhere in Washington or Oregon, this book would likely have it.  Plant descriptions are solid, photographs are crisp and professional, and the county maps showing distribution are a tremendous addition (I cannot emphasize this enough).  Anyone in the Pacific Northwest who is even a fleeting interest in wildflowers has to pick this up",1
"This book is an excellent discussion of the ways adoption is experienced by all members of the triad, with particular emphasis on the normal developmental issues adoptees face at different times of their lives. Joyce Maguire Pavao is clear and forthright, sensitive and reassuring. Her wise insight is illustrated with examples and the poetry of adoptees. I highly recommend this book",1

"In the year 1992 four Funky Divas arrived on the scene. The first time I heard the song, Free Your Mind I was hooked. The words of this song are still so true to this day and I related to them on another level.This is written about how ones perception of another race or color are clouded by the outside and not looking at the person as a whole. This line here tells it all, "" Before you can read me you gotta learn how to see me"".The song is about how store clerks flock to watch the black women in the stores and how it makes them feel being watched because they use cash even though they have credit too. Some may have their hair straight or curled and neither means they do drugs or sell dope. Black sisters change their mind just like everyone else and wear high heels and funky clothes and should not be viewed as someone with less value than those who dress stylish or conservative.Other phrases like how they can date other races and colors but they still like their own kind. This sums it up for me, "" Oh now attitude why even bother, I can't change your mind you can't change my color"". Prejudice is still alive and well here in the year 2001.This song brings me out of my funk, lifts me up with the message to free my mind and kick up my heels to this tune. Turns out Funky Divas has lots of songs that are worth listening to. Hip Hop Lover is over five minutes being the longest cut also on Side A right before Free Your Mind. Desire is all about fantasies and trying to keep them in control every hour of the day. This is Your Life is about the lesson of listening to what others say and how to find your dreams. You got to live it your way is repeated in this song and how to share your feelings.My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It) this song recites a love and hate relationship that goes nowhere. What she really wants is respect and tells him he is wasting his time.Giving Him Something He Can Feel the tune that ends the first side are the words of Curtis Mayfield. How to tell the man that you love that this love is real is a nice ballad for slow dancing and keeping close by touching the one you love.Give It Up, Turn It Loose is a tune about not wasting time playing games when in love and how to turn it around and get past the old and on with the new. "" Don't blame it all on love, in time good things will come"" and how to be positive and not dwindle on the past.Hooked On Your Love is another tune with the words and music by Curtis Mayfield.Love Don't Love You is about how love was in the beginning and that there needs to be more than love to make a satisfying life, people change and "" Love don't care"". What Is Love is about how complex the word love is and how modern technology can do so much but no one can explain the word love.Funky Divas is a great uplifting mix of tunes for those who enjoy rhythm and blues, soul, and some rap and hip hop jamming. It really does not matter if you are currently in a relationship or not this has a benefit for all races and either male or female that like to dance and get in the groove will want to listen to this in a group, alone or blasting in your car. This is sure to open your eyes and Free Your Mind to all the issues the Funky Divas have faced.",0
"I read many positive reviews on Pure Grace and decided to try it since I love a fresh, clean scent.  I was very disapointed when I used it, as it reminded me of Jean nate, which to me is an old lady smell.  It was more musky than clean smelling.  I couldn't smell any hint of feminine sweetness or floweriness to it.  It smelled like scented musky water with a sesemee oil...that is the only way I can describe it",0
"This is a beautiful production of Puccini's trio of short, one-act operas.  Most underrated, and most impressive here, is the first piece, IL TABARRO, starring Piero Cappuccilli and legendary soprano/actress Sylvia Sass, both  of whom perform with a high level of intensity, passion, tenderness and  complexity.  The music is gorgeous and fascinating, with some wonderful  duets that come organically out of the story.  Watch how the light  gradually gets dimmer and dimmer as the opera progresses and as the story  gets darker and darker",0
"I must admit that my review is pretty biased because I didn't even finish the book, but I did, painfully, get through the first 100 pages.  Suze was a fun character but nothing about Lloyd appealed to me.  His sequences were a bore to read about.  The plot developed slowly but I figured that maybe it was just because I hadn't gotten far enough into the book.  I vowed to get to page 100 and assess after I reached that hurdle.  By page 100 I still wasn't intrigued. Further, out of curiosity I skipped to the last few chapters and read those to see if the book had gotten any better.  Apparently, it hadn't.  The ending was pretty cheesy.I'm glad that I didn't waste my time reading the other 200 pages - you shouldn't bother with the book either",1
"Hooray, a new Miss Zukas! Helma's at it again, with more reason than usual for plying her investigative skills, since the deaths involved are related to the new library building site.

I can't blame Helma for wanting to keep Wayne on his toes a bit, though, and you just can't hurry a cat.

There is a big difference between the quality of a movie and the message that it attempts to convey.

"The Magic Window: American Television 1939-1953 by American popular culture expert James Von Schilling (Professor of English, Northampton Community College) provides a scholarly presentation of the inherently fascinating story of how television became the immensely popular attraction and cultural force it is today. From the electronic phenomenon's first public appearance in the 1939 New York World's Fair, to the creation and development of landmark and influential programming from 1939 to 1953, and television's rapid proliferation to the point where it became an integral part of almost every American household ever since, The Magic Window is meticulously detailed in its presentation. Especially recommended reading for TV buffs wanting to learn more about the history of this widespread and widely beloved form of mass-media, The Magic Window is also commended to the attention of students and scholars in the fields of 20th Century American History, American Popular Culture, and Communications &amp; Media Studies",1

I hope that with time, they will be as common place in American homes as Asparirn is today.

"If you liked the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"" or have actually heard of the album ""White Mansions,"" then you would want to check out this 1991 collection of ""Songs of the Civil War.""  The various artists are not only folk singers like Judy Collins and Richie Havens, but country singers such as Waylon Jennings and Kathy Mattea, and artists who work the area in between, namely John Hartford.  But mainly this album is going to be of primary interest to those interested in the Civil War who will most enjoy hearing familiar songs sung by familiar voices, and certainly be introduced to both new songs and singers as well, such as when Sweet Honey in the Rock sings ""No More Auction Block.""  Sometimes you will be surprised to learn who is singing what, as I was when Jennings did ""Rebel Soldier,"" but that just speaks to why this is such a great album.In fact, when the U.S. Military Band shows up to play instrumental version of ""Dixie's Land"" and ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home,"" it is something of a disappointment since these tracks are most like what we have heard on previous collections of Civil War music.  I know that Havens is not doing ""Follow the Drinking Gourd"" the way it was done back in the 1850s, but I do not have a problem with his ""modern"" interpretation of the song sung by slaves traveling the Underground Railroad.  The only one where I did not like the interpretation was when Hartford did ""Lorena"" more up tempo than I think the song should be sung.  There are some liberties taken with the song selection, because while ""Ashokan Farewell"" is so closely identified with the Civil War because of the Ken Burns documentary, it is not a song ""from"" the Civil War (I suppose that semantically ""of"" gets the title off the hook).  Not that I have gone through and checked the bona fides of each of these twenty-five songs.  When Ronnie Gilbert of the Weavers shows up to sign the political song ""Lincoln and Liberty,"" I am not about to complain.  Hoyt Axton's ""Yellow Rose of Texas"" is about as far out of place as anything gets on the album, but he also does ""Oh I'm a Good Ole Rebel,"" which is clearly on firmer ground. What might be most impressive about this collection is the way it combines so many different musical styles, from Traditional Folk and Black Gospel to Bluegrass and Outlaw Country.  There are more and you can quibble on the labels, but you get the point.  Standout tracks for me were Mattea's ""Southern Solider Boy,"" Hartford's tender ""Aura Lee,"" Sweet Honey in the Rock's ""Run, Mourner, Run,"" and the McGarrigle sisters on the Stephen Foster song ""Better Times Are Coming.""  Actually, all three of the songs Kate and Anna sing on the album are by Stephen Foster, which certainly suits their harmonic talents.  Mattea has three tracks as well and is as much of a standout performer on the album as anyone.  Final Note: choosing to do ""Marching Through Georgia"" as an instrumental strikes me as making a point of avoiding having the lyrics of the most hated song of the Civil War (by far) on the album (not that there is anything wrong with that).   The fact that ""Songs of the Civil War"" ends with Steve Luck blowing ""Taps"" is just a final reminder that they knew what they were doing when they put this album together",0
"As most every one of my friends is privy, I am a HUGE fan of Will Ferrell.  I personally think he is one of the funniest men in work today, and he never fails to impress me.  That said, `Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' is one of his funniest most entertaining films and is sure to please any fan of Ferrell.  As Ricky Bobby, Ferrell plays a man obsessed with going fast.  The first few minutes of the film introduce you to his loser father whose only words of advise to his young son are ""if your not first, your last"" and that's the motto Ricky's lived by his whole life.  Twenty-five years later and he is first in every race, his best friend Cal (Reilly who is just as funny as Ferrell) always coming in second place.When Jean Girard (Cohen), a gay French racer, comes to take Bobby's spot at the top things turn ugly, and when a stroke of bad luck hits our hero he's left at the bottom, his `smoking hot wife' Carley (Leslie Bibb) leaving him for Cal and taking his house sending him to live with his mother (Jane Lynch) and his two hellion children Walker (Houston Tumlin) and Texas Ranger (Grayson Russell).  With the help of his father Reese (Gary Cole) Ricky is able to regain his passion for the race and regain his place at the top.With non-stop laughs provided by the entire cast, not just the always hilarious Ferrell, but everyone from Reilly to Michael Clarke Duncan and Amy Adams and Molly Shannon (who plays a priceless drunk!), this makes for one brilliant ensemble film  With one liners that will live as long as ""you my boy Blue"" and moments that will go down as the funniest we've seen from this brilliant SNL alumni, Ferrell has cemented himself as one of our most talented comedians, and he can now add writer to his resume, for he shows great chops with this script.  I haven't been this entertained in quite a long time.  Forget Pirates, this is the summer blockbuster...best I've seen this year",0

"I would like to commend Dr. Redmond on writing such a helpful, informative, and interesting book.  I cannot say enough good things about it.  His knowledge and understanding of the problems hormones can cause in women, as well as his compassion and desire to help us through this hormonally challenging time in our lives (when it's easy to feel betrayed by our own bodies) is apparent in every page.  I applaud his ability to present the information in an easy-to-understand, balanced, and unbiased format.  I also like his personal anecdotes and conversational style.  Every woman who picks up this book will learn something valuable about her body--mainly the function of her hormones, how they can affect nearly every aspect of her life, and what she can do about the problems they cause.  If you're a woman caught in a losing battle with your hormones, I urge you to buy this book and read it!  No matter how many doctors have told you ""you'll just have to learn to live with it,"" don't believe it--you can get help. You just need to know where to look and what questions to ask, and this book points the way. ",1
"Proof once again that the Brits make the best films.  This film would never be made in America.  Its blend of social satire, comedy, political comment, and underlying seriousness, makes this film unique.  That someone could call this film ""frothy"" is incomprehensible to me.  It is a deft satire with a serious message, without ever seeming serious. The film makes you think while it is entertaining you.  Guiness is superb as the brilliant, but clueless, scientist who invents a fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out.  Seems great, doesn't it.  But a worker at the plant where Sidney (Guinness) works sees what he doesn't: that they will only have to make one lot. So labor turns against the idea, and of course, management wants to suppress it (in favor of planned obsolescence).  It is all delicious fun all the way, all the while making you think about modern, consumer-driven economies.  The cast is composed of Ealing regulars, all of whom turn in top notch performances.  This is one of the all time great films.  Don't miss it",0
"If you are a fan of the Melvins, hate the melvins, never heard the melvins then you should buy this one.  little judas chongo still gives me chills.  it sounds like a demented minutemen song.  this album is the best melvins thus far.

"i've been walking for a long time but this book got me walking every day instead of once in a while and taught me how to get the maximum out of my walks. i've stopped obssessing about my weight and my whole attitude towards my body and towards the concept of regular exercise has changed. the best thing about this book is that it is a daily, weekly and yearly companion that keeps you on the exercise regime. fenton's writing is guiless and honest -- a friendly push out the door. no criticism, just encouragement to start enjoying the natural movement of your own body. his frankness and simplicity are refreshing",1
"Mr. Hauptman hits the mark with his clear, no nonsense style.  Although himself a seasoned veteran, he's able to see the sport through the eyes of an outsider, and therein is the secret to the success of this book.  He addresses all the issues a beginner needs to know to get up and running in short order.  The reader quickly loses any sense of intimidation that so often hinders the progress of novices.  You'll actually feel comfortable talking fishing with experts after you've read this book.  I found the book dated in only one way, namely, it recommends mail-order purchase of equipment - a dead give-away that it was written in the pre-web era",1
"I saw the first Qatsi Movie ""Koyaanisqatsi"" some years ago on a Canadian Music Station, Much Music, it aired a number of times and most likely due to there being no dialogue, it is all set to music and very inspirational and yet dark and almost foreboding music. Philip Glass is one of the people behind this and well, I thought to check Amazon for this movie Koyaanisqatsi and discovered there were three in all in the Qatsi series, so, I bought them all and will enjoy them all again and again. Koyaanisqatsi, Powaqqatsi, Naqoyqatsi, Three of the best movies I own... and Amazon had them in stock and sent right away. These movies present more than just entertainment, they really have me thinking about the world differently now",0
"I recently discovered moe. over a year ago when I happened to catch their set at bonnaroo 04. I had heard of them from people but hadnt heard any of their music. I was blown away by the musical expertise each band member employs in their work.

This cd displays all the wonderful assets of their music and the versions of these songs won't let you down. Songs like YOY, Waiting for the Punchline, Recreational Chemistry and Dr. Graffenberg are the best versions of these songs Ive heard anywhere. Also check out the moe.down5 recording from sat night, good show too. And this cd even has a secret song unmarked #7 on disc 2 as brent black as it goes into the theme from the song ""all my friends are lowriders"" with rob and vinnie adding the ""take a little trip with me"" vocals. Best live moe. recording Ive heard. These guys are unbelieveable, check out the bonnaroo 04 dvd, great version of rebubula",0
"Christians beware! This book hides dangerous cultic teachings behind the so called spiritual insights from the Ten Commandments. This book gives a cultic (even satanic) twist to the Decalogue (ie.  evil can masquerade as an angel of light).  It is indeed a deceptive Trojan horse filled with ""Christian Science"" heresies. According to Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the First Church of Christ, Scientist, universally known as Christian Science, Jesus could not die for Man's sins, because Mankind never sinned; Christ did not really die on the cross therefore He resurrected from non-death. Christian Science also declares that the Scriptures cannot properly be interpreted in a literal way, and thus, the truth of scripture must be spiritually discerned before its message can be applied to our lives.Therefore, this book is hiding harmful non-Christian (new thought / new age style) metaphysics and psychic interpretations behind the precepts of the Ten Commandments.  Moreover, Fox here promotes a salvation by works and positive thinking that is foreign to the Bible.For those who wrote positive reviews of this book I want to say that Christianity is not about spirits seeking and deep trances, but it is all about the finding of the only Spirit of God, deep thankfulness in sincere meditation on the Gospel of the Cross, and above all, a relationship with God through His resurrected Son, Jesus Christ who died for our sins, so that we can be saved by the grace of God through faith alone. Emmet Fox's books can indeed change your life but in a wrong direction.  The teachings and interpretations of the Christian Science are not at all Christian and are also foreign to Judaism.  This cult resembles more eastern mysticism rather than Judeo-Christian doctrines.  Also this is not at all science.  I am amazed by how its people perceive the teachings of Christian science as being enlightened and how they see themselves as being thinkers.  This is complete ignorance.  These people do not even know how to think, much less how to think critically.  They are ignorant about the doctrines of the Bible, ignorant of theological, cultural exegesis, ignorant of historical / textual criticism, and ignorant about real, genuine science.The religion of (non)Christian (non)science is theologically, philosophically, Biblically and scientifically false; its roads end in eternal damnation",1
"Aristotle was in fact a Macedonian by birth and had as one of his utmost desires to be accepted in Athens as a full-fledged citizen, something he never attained. To be or not a citizen at those times, was the determinant factor in the importance each one attained in the social structure. One has to keep in mind that all the political concepts that we inherited from the Greeks, got a different perspective at those times, where slavery was normally accepted and practised against the non-Greeks human beings. Aristotle was a disciple of Plato, whom he quotes many times in a derogatory manner, and he lived in Athens many years after years of tutorship of Philip and his son Alexander of Macedonia, to whom he did not mention a word of praise or reprimand in this book. What amazed most after reading this excelent book is the maturity the institutions had attained at his times, and the degree of accuracy and detail to which he devotes many chapters analysing the constitutions of many Greek states, Sparta included. One word of caution has to be addresed to the student of poltics: this is not a book about statecraft or the arts of governing people at 350 BC. All in all, the text seems to lose some strenght due to the impossibity of translating so rich a text and by the lack of precise terms for each and every situation there described. But, in the end, the reader  will get a glimpse of this very important period of western civilazation, specially if one has in mind that the heyday of Greece was gone and what lays ahead was the supremacy of Rome as world militar empire. To add interest to the reader, one has to keep in mind that the powerfull influence the aristotelian thought had in the medieval thinking",1

I am a 7th Day Adventist Christian and Ellen G. White who is the visionary messenger of the 7th Day Adventist Church warned that fallen Angels are the ones who impersonate dead people from the past. So basically speaking the  Essene master who is in touch with Dolores Cannon is a Demon Spirit who  opposes true Christianity. God clearly warned in passages of the Old  Testament such as Deuteronomy 18:9-14 that his ancient hebrew people were  not to communicate with so-called spirits of the dead because in reality  they are demons and are at war with God. Past life regression is another  form of Seance a very dangerous practice which can lead people to come  under demonic control or influence,1

I really like the songs, their catchy and I'll catch myself singing them when it's not on, ha ha. I highly recommend this.

"The Astronaut's Wife, starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron was a major disappointment. My husband and I have what we call the 30-Minute Rule when it comes to watching DVD's. Since our spare time is so limited, if we are not completely engrossed in the movie at the end of 30 minutes, we stop and put something else on.I'm sorry to say that The Astronaut's Wife did not make it past the 30-Minute rule. In fact, I found myself watching the timer, wishing the minutes would go by faster so we could find a better way to waste our time.The first thing is, the movie is slow. Very, very, very slow. There are lots of camera angles on Charlize Theron looking thoughtful, Charlize looking pensive, Charlize looking worried, Charlize looking scared, Charlize looking sad- well, you get the idea. Everything seems to happen as though we are watching it through a very long tunnel-- noises are slightly muted and have an ""out-of-body"" sound to them.Even Johnny Depp is not enough to save this movie. The feeling I generally get when watching Johnny Depp in a role is that nobody else could have played that part because he makes it so much his own. In this instance, however, I can think of a dozen different actors who could have played the part, and we wouldn't have noticed the difference.If you must watch it, put it on fast forward and read the subtitles. That way you'll get it over with faster.",0

"I remmember as a kid of watching this show many times and it is the funniest. I'm glad the entire series is finally coming to DVD for the first time ever.And another cool fact is that once this series comes to DVD that means every tv show of Sonic that has ever been aired on tv will be out to buy. Starting with this one and SatAM which is also coming out soon. The DVD box set of Sonic Underground has also been out recently on Amazon but one problem is that box set is a region 2 set meaning it won't play on most DVD players in America but you can get a multi regional DVD player her on Amazon for a really good price. The entire series of Sonic X is now out but each DVD is a volunm and is sold seperatly. Another cool thing you all should know is that in 1996 Japan was making their own Sonic the Hedgehog series but it only ran 2 episodes and got cancled. Later on England bought a copy of those two episodes from Sega and translated it and edited them both together and relesed as the Sonic the Hedgehog The Movie on video in 1999. Recently they digitaly remastered the movie and it is now out on Amazon in DVD format. If you want to start your own BIG Sonic DVD collection, you can start right now",0

"This book appeals to a select audience. Those who enjoy reading about the great chase for the treasures of the world. Treasures that wars have been fought over.  Those who enjoy reading about the super-rich and their foibles. Those who enjoy reading about the intrigues and back stabbings in elite organizations (this book makes The Apprentice look like a pillow fight). And finally those who enjoy reading about a man's all consuming ambition to succeed and yet through it all remain passionate about great art.  If any of the above is your cub of tea then you are going to love this. I absolutely recommend his later book 'False Impressions'. And yes, the author spares no punches in his analysis of alot of famous people.",1
"This is certainly one of the classics of Masterpiece Theater and is highly recommended to all who are interested in historical drama.  It is a marvelously and beautifully realized set-piece that, for the most part, accurately describes the chaotic events that occurred during the days and months that led up to independance of the India and Pakistan (and the early nationhood of each).  The characterizations of the leads and of all the actors in the cast are stunning and it is easy to forget that you are not watching a re-creation of the events.  I was particularly impressed with the performance of Vladek Sheybal as Ali Jinnah and A. K. Hangal who played Sardar Patel.  Sheybal's aloofness and calculating manner simply nailed the Jinnah about whom I have read and Hangal's Patel was a brilliant ""wheeler-dealer,"" manipulator and above all, a realist as I believe Patel clearly was.  They clearly outshined their more famous rivals, Nicol Williamson and Ian Richardson, who turned in their expected star performances and yet did not bring out the souls of their characters in the same depth as did Sheybal and Hangal.  Perhaps this was due to Mountbatten and Nehru being far more complex and greater men.  It is difficult to assess.  Janet Susman was marvelous as Lady Mountbatten and provided just the proper amount of tension to bring out some needed depth in the Mountbatten character that would otherwise have been lacking.  Dastor's Gandhi was just fine, yet coming a scant three years after Kingley's Gandhi, it would certainly seem to be in the shadow of that portrayal.  Yet it is satisfying.  This set is particularly recommended to all with an interest in Indian history.  I have to admit that I am prejudiced in favor of India, having traveled to India in the 1970's and having lived with families there.  While there, I lectured on our U.S. First Amendment (Freedom of Speech) as the Emergency and subsequent election of the Janata Party occurred.  During this time, I had many discussions with Indian friends concerning their thoughts about the Raj.  Of course most agreed that independence had been inevitable for the world's largest democracy and that colonialism had not been very satisfactory for them.  Today, I am amused that I could even think to ask about the obvious, but the answers to these questions were not so to a naive young man and the Indian folks I met were always gracious and patient in answering my questions - both common Indian traits, which I am pleased to note can be easily seen in this film.

"I rarely write a review despite the fact that I read so many books, but felt this one deserved special attention.  I am looking to build a log home in Southeast Alaska and wanted to have a nice rock wall foundation and a spectacular fireplace.  After reading this book I am confident that I can do most of the work myself (except the footing for the foundation) and feel confident that it will look totally professional (and be bomb proof).  The book is well written, very readable, has good photos, and is probably the only book you will need to do any and all stone work.  It is not a book on slip form and it is not a coffee table book - it is for building in stone",1

Push the other button and 5 seconds later the cork is off the opener.  Put it back in the charging stand",0
"     This book is so powerful.  There is no way that you could read this book and not finish it within a day.  Each moment that you spend reading it you want to keep going and going.  There are so many twists and turns that you don't want to wait until you're awake enough to read it another day.  I honestly couldn't let go of it.  I stayed up the entire night until I was finished.  Being tired was not the problem.  A movie puts you to sleep because you're watching things happen.  Reading a book brings your own imagination into it, and you get to see it the way you want to.  This story in particular is best for being read.  Any attempts to making a film out of this would be very difficult.  The story line grabs your heart, your mind, all of you, and before you know it you're inside the story.  You experience the emotions and find yourself crying and blowing your nose as if you were watching some incredible love story. This book becomes so real with its spectacular details and different point of views.  Whether you want to cry or not you will be moved.  It isn't a sad book, but rather joyful and triumphant.  Even the most happy moments make your heart swell and your eyes water",1

"I read the old edition, from the library, and it is completely one of the most fascinating books I've ever read. It was recommended as background reading for a history of Western Christianity course I took. This book is perhaps not as furnished with specific details as some would prefer, but as a comprehensive overview of the Mediterranean world in the middle ages it is extremely successful. It is true that the book focuses only on Europe and the world specifically surrounding it (North Africa, the near East, Scandinavia and some of Russia) but I think it is also arguable that we consider ""the medieval world"" to be specifically that area in light of the social and cultural history associated with the Middle Ages. Using the same map over again is extremely useful and makes the book easy to understand (producing an enjoyable flip-book effect, as another reviewer said). The text is wonderful: though dense, it is extremely easy to understand and McEvedy brings an enjoyable personal flavor to his narration. The absence of most significant landmarks on the map is sometimes inconvenient; I found myself turning to the full map in the index quite frequently. However, I feel that not cluttering the maps with excess print is probably worth the inconvenience. Throughout the book, specific people are identified by an elaborate shading-and-bordering system that, once one has adjusted to it, makes reading the maps very easy. If you are looking for an informative and fantastically compelling broad history of the middle ages, this is a most desirable book.",1

"Wishbone Ash have often been called the English Allman Brothers and there are quite a few outward similarities. Two great live bands each with two superb guitarists and a tight, driving rhythm section cranking out music that acknowledges it's roots while constantly going beyond them. But while the roots of the early Allmans(before the untimely death of brother Duane)were firmly in Southern blues, Wishbone Ash finds their inspiration in the pre-Christian mysticism and eerie melodies found in English folk music. But make no mistake about it, this is tight, driving rock n' roll delivered by one of the best live bands of the 70's. If you go for guitar driven rock with a distinctly English flavor Live Dates will become one of your all time favorites",0

"Two of my absolute favorite women here - Janeane and Uma, so I enjoyed seeing it when it first came out.  Then I watched it again last week.  Wow what a difference eight years made in my perception.Alot of humor is funny because there is some underlying truth.  But have you ever heard the dead silence following the punch line because a joke struck a little too close to home?Of all the thousands of actresses they could have picked,... they picked these two, who because they personify so perfectly the sterotypes that are supposed to make this movie so funny..., I didn't laugh as much as I had the first time.Here are two fabulous women, Jeanane and Uma, who contribute to the life experience of the rest of us here on the planet simply because they exist.  Due in part to their humanity and vulnerability, they are gifted actresses (and brillint comedienne and stunning model).  But they are also people who I suspect in real life, because of something as arbitrary as the exterior contours of their bodies, also probably suffer because of these external realities.  I know its supposed to be a comedy, but I couldn't help but think about the real life experiences of women like these.  Sure I laughed when it was funny, like when Jeanane looks up after the idiot guy breaks her violin bow (who does deadpan, sarcastic, and angst better than Janeane?), and when Uma makes the guy fall off his bike.  But I couldn't help but empathize with both women.  Sure the ending is sweet, if totally unrealistic.  You hope for both women that they will find quality men who understand them, and are worthy of them.  But in a movie with ""The Truth About..."" in its title, you know what the truth really is.Five stars because I enjoyed it.  I wish I could find more of Jeanane in a comedy setting, she is absolutely brilliant, unique, and wonderful (and hot - the phone sex was amazing!).  Uma is marvelous, and I hope she does less action work in the future, so her gorgeous personality can come out like I think it did in this movie.The characters end as friends because they were loyal to each other - the foundation of a great relationship.  This was my happy ending (which occured ten or fifteen minutes before the romantic one)",0

Trevor Nunns direction is sensitive and sharp and the costuming and camera work beautiful.This is a must have for anyone who loves Shakespeare.  Even my eleven year old son enjoys this movie.  It was (on video) one of the first Shakespeare films I introduced to my children (I have 6) and they have all loved it.  Thanks to Nunn and Kenneth Branagh my children have never struggled with the Shakespeare part of High School English.  They sail right on through, while many of their peers flounder.Thus I can say that this movie is not only entertaining but educational as well. ",0

"If your operating system is down, you don't have access to the ""fancier"" editors available that actually have interfaces that make sense to normal people. At this moment, particularly if you are in a system administrator position, you must know vi in order to access and modify files. It is so easy to pick up vi the wrong way - usually by word of mouth from someone who has learned vi the wrong way too. This book is the best I've found that is dedicated to properly teaching you the features of the vi editor and how to use them. O'Reilly has experimented with several book formats over the last ten years. This book is what I like to call ""classic O'Reilly"". It is the same format that most of their other books on Unix tools are generally written in, and if you have their books on sed and awk or Unix Power Tools, you know what I'm talking about. If you have learned the wrong way, or if you are a bonified beginner, start at the beginning of part one. Don't skip anything. Even if you think you already know something, at least read through the section to make sure you know the best way of doing it. By the end of the first seven chapters you should be a pretty skilled user of vi. The book makes frequent use of practice exercises, answers common questions, and gives advice on what to do when you encounter common problems. By the time you finish you'll even be writing ex scripts and modifying C/C++ code in the vi editor without accidentally inserting all kinds of control characters that will drive programmers crazy once ""the real editor"" is back on line.Part two starts at chapter eight and concerns itself with all of the various extensions to vi that are available via the four most popular vi clones available when this book was published. You do get some enhancements such as multi-window editing and even GUI interfaces by using them, but the cost is an increase in the confusion factor that this book tries to clear up as much as possible. If you are not planning on using a vi clone, you may want to just file this section of the book away in case the subject ever comes up.Part 3 consists of several useful appendices. Four of the appendices are still useful, but the fifth, on vi and the Internet, is a bit dated. I highly recommend this book if the vi editor is in your future, and if you have system administrator duties, believe me it is. You might also want to invest in the very handy ""vi Editor Pocket Reference"" by the same author. I have mixed feelings about that one. Everything is there in a concise format, but until you get used to it, information can be hard to find.",1
"I never heard of Alter Bridge until a buddy of mine gave it to me for my Bday recently.  Wow!  Now, that I've listened to it.

"A master's student of Asian cultures at the University of Pennsylvania, I first began reading William Dalrymple's books in the winter of 2003, just prior to my first trip to Asia.  I found a beat up copy of ""The Age of Kali"" in my neighborhood's library when I was working a soul-killing desk job.  The book was, in many ways, my introduction to India.  It would not be an exaggeration to say that this book changed my life.If you have read this far, then you must, must, must read these books.  I studied in India in 2004 and am now reading ""City of Djinn"", about Dalrymple's year in Delhi and it is just as intoxicating as ""Age of Kali.""  I wrote Mr. Dalrymple the following email just last night:Hello William!I'm finishing up my master's thesis and procrastinating the final touches (again) and I went surfing the web and came upon your site. I'm the middle of ""City of Djinn"" and I just wanted to THANK YOU for  both this book AND ""The Age of Kali"", which I read shortly before my first trip to Asia in 2003.  I won't go into detail as I can't procrastinate for quite that long, but the book changed my life and it made me fall in love with India.I finally spent time in India - the summer of 2004 and found that A of K was instrumental in my quest to decode some small part of the India around me. So, there you have it.  Not as effusive and jubilant as it might be (it's 1:30 am here on the East Coast of the USA) but sincere and long overdue, nonetheless.Good night from the USA,Elizabeth GarrottPS:  Thank you, also, for the portrait of Balvinder Singh, the Puris, William Fraser,  and lady who died at the ""hands"" of a milk-fed cobra - all from ""City of Djinn",1

"This book is a delightful addition to the shelf of any book lover who is also a dog lover! The premise of the book is that the author is a golden retriever named Trixie, who belongs to bestselling author Dean Koontz. Trixie writes with a distinctive voice that immediately welcomes the reader into her world. She is clever, down-right funny at times, and sweet: everything a good golden retriever dog should be. She is also motivated by her tummy-- and the lengths she goes to for treats will have anyone who lives with dogs laughing out loud. Trixie's point of view about Christmas is heartwarming without being too sweet, but the absurdities of family gatherings and holiday traditions are not lost on the old girl! Trixie's commentaries about presents and her Christmas Wish List are worth the price of the book, but there is much more to be enjoyed in this little volume. My family and I, human and canines, had a ball reading this book aloud on Christmas Eve-- it will be a part of our family tradition from now on. 5 stars-- buy it today",1
"Few military &quot;picture books&quot; have given me as much unexpected pleasure as this one.  Having bought it by mail on the basis of its subject matter alone, I was very pleasantly surprised when it not only met - but exceeded - my expectations.  Lavishly (dare I say beautifully) illustrated by abundant carefully selected and wonderfully reproduced photos and charts, it exhaustively covers almost all aspects of the Canadian soldier in Northwest Europe in the final year of World War II.  The succinct text (written in homage by French authors, but adequately transcribed into English) provides a good outline against which to appreciate this visual material.  While the treatment of any individual subject may not be as deep as that found in books dediciated to a specific topic, I can confidently say that no one single volume provides as much useful information as this one does",1

I have two Italian Greyhounds; one is a 13 week old puppy; and it was always scary going out the front door and returning through it wondering if they would bolt out.

"This guidebook is divided into eight sections by geographic region, with a top-level map up front and detailed maps of each location by section.  The entire book is black and white, but the maps and pictures are still crystal clear.  The opening chapter is an index referencing any subject one could want to find in Rhode Island, from ballooning to antiques to quahogs to yachting.  I was most impressed with the ""Green Spaces"" section for each region, listing dozens of outdoor parks and activities available in the Ocean State.  While there are certainly other more detailed outdoor guidebooks to Rhode Island, they haven't been updated recently, and this is a great overview guide to the riches of ""green space"" available in Little Rhody.  Also included are beaches with recommendations about what outdoor activities are appropriate at each.  Plus, if you want to visit historic houses, historic churches, historic mansions, or general historic sites, this is the state and the guidebook for you.For Activities, price information is noticeably missing.  Perhaps detailed prices date a guidebook too much, but as a traveler, I'd like to get an idea whether this boat excursion or that historic house is within my general budget.  Restaurants, on the other hand, are broken into price categories, and include terse yet informative descriptive information about the cuisine, location, and atmosphere.  As a native, I'm well aware that hotels in Rhode Island are just plain more expensive than they are in other parts of the country.  If you want to sleep in luxury, you can find some great direction from this guide.  For a deal, I'd recommend utilizing Internet search engines.  The low single-dollar-sign category in this book refers to hotels under a ""mere"" $95 (as of 2000).There is something to be said for compact guidebooks, and this is not one.  It is a generously oversized paperback with thick pages and both large fonts and margins.  This isn't a book to tuck into your extra backpack pocket when trekking around.  Then again, all that extra text left the authors room to inform me that Goddard Park was man-made by two generations of owners and is cited as one of the best man-made forestry projects of all time.

"An excellent political thriller by Brian De Palma. John Travolta plays a movie sound-effects man who inadvertently records a gunshot, tire blow-out, and a car crashing into a creek off a bridge. He saves the girl (Nancy Allen) who was in the car, but another occupant, the governor of Pennsylvania and presidential candidate, drowns. It becomes obvious that the governor was being set up for blackmail, and now those involved want it covered up by getting rid of the witnesses. The acting is superb and De Palma really builds up the tension to a riveting climax (which, after the fact, feels like a letdown because Travolta is able to get the man behind the conspiracy (John Lithgow - who is actually a CIA agent and the perfect foil for De Palma's obsession with conspiracy theories [echoes of Chappaquiddick and Dallas]), but the truth may never be revealed because evidence has been destroyed - and Allen is killed at the end. Filmed in Philadelphia, De Palma has a great feel for the city. Everything (mostly) works here; the movie is of a whole. (Although I have a personal problem with why two innocent women are killed by Lithgow; there seems to be no apparent reason for it.) It's an excellent movie, and there is much to mull over after it's done rolling",0
"      This is my first ""taste"" of one of the Stern's books, and the read was a fast, wry, humorous journey into the back roads of America and its roadside eateries. The Sterns venture deep into rural areas where probably many Northeasterners  have not dared to tread, and they do it with grace, aplomb, wit and a sincere and mutual appreciation for kitsch of all kinds (including unusual Americana only available in prison gift shops), and for genuine down-home, regional, American fare. I fully appreciated being the recipient of the Stern's tried and true methods for scouting out outstanding food. If I am ever on the road, off the beaten path, I will certainly take the Stern's advice. If I happen to spot  a giant pig or cow (which signifies the specialty of the house) on the roof  of the eatery, and if said pig or cow is dressed in a tuxedo and carries a walking stick, I will pull over immediately, because there is an excellent chance that there are untold gastronomic treasures hidden within, just waiting to be consumed and never forgotten. The book provides a glimpse into rural America and a way of life that is foreign to many, including myself. It is a glimpse into towns with less than a population of 500, towns whose inhabitants are so isolated from one another that farmers' wives depend on the ""radio homemaker"" for helpful hints and to satisfy their need for some kind of daily human contact and connection, towns whose inhabitants look forward all year to the state fair where they can show off their preserves, pies and livestock, with roomy overalls being the preferred mode of dress to allow for expansion which will result from the requisite sampling of the delicious, carb-overloaded foods typically featured at these events,  towns with cafes where personalized mugs are hung, waiting for their owners to fill them for their daily cup of Joe, and where everyone really does know your name and the number of dairy cows you have. I find it refreshing that the Sterns have turned dining-out snobbism on its face, and they have elevated the status of American roadside dining. Yes, the Sterns have dined at Lutece and Four Seasons, but they would much prefer to dine at a rib joint in Tennessee, marveling and fully appreciating the wonder of a menu with barbeque sauce hardened and aged in the corners. Although I would never eat the fat and cholesterol-laden food they adore, where everything seems to be fried and smothered in gravy or sugar, I thoroughly enjoyed traveling down America's back roads with the Sterns",1

I have been a Christian since I was a child and grew up learning the stories of the Bible. It is only after reading this book that my entire view of scripture has been re-adjusted and changed. The Bible is now a living book for me. For the first time I actually feel like I undertand Paul's letters. I just read the reviews and am unsure why Amazon put that critical review as the spotlight especially when there have been so many positive reviews on this book. I too have read Gene Edwards and this book is nothing like them. If you want to understand Paul's letters this is the book to get,1
"If you're looking for a recipe book of Indian food that is both easy to follow and the food tastes great, stop looking and buy this one!I've cooked at least 70% of the recipes in this book and they've all been amazing!  Note that even though my husband is from Kerela and I'm from Punjab, both of us love the recipes.  We've used the kabob recipes for summertime potlucks, and our friends still rave.  The desserts are easy to follow and loved even by the aunties in my life!  Many of the recipes are easy enough to use on weekdays too.  I should have started by saying that we don't cook much.  We're either too lazy or too tired by the end of the day to cook -- and Maya inspires us to change! ",1
"New director for this third episode. The modern world is growing and we are starting to have the information highway coming into the picture. The new architecture is very striking and powerful. We come back to a girl as the center of the film, but at once that girl is living with her mother and her male guests. But also at once she is moved to a hospital where she meets a whole gang of young people who are Freddy's victims. Freddy does not try to make anyone kill the others. At first he tries to terrorize them into committing suicide. Society reacts as can be expected : the kids are calling for some attention and their dreams and suicides are nothing but the symptoms of their guilt. A junior doctor reacts positively when a psychiatrist comes into the picture, and this psychiatrist is the surviving girl of a preceding episode. This leads to a psychiatric ward in a hospital with all these kids, and group therapy. This time Freddy has a group against him, a group that can remain united, or at least the survivors can, and they can start a war against this Freddy. The film also densifies Freddy Krueger with a mother who was a medical personnel in the old psychiatric ward of the very hospital in which we are. This wing of the building was closed when this young woman was by accident left behind in the ward surrounded by all kinds of crazy criminals. She was raped and many other things and Freddy is her son. Even worse she lost her head, though not completely and could then dedicate the end of her life to religion. She became a nun. The father of the young psychiatrist who has survived Freddy was one of those who burnt Freddy to death when he was caught after kudnapping and killing twenty children. His remains had never been buried. The father will finally accept to tell where the bones are. During that time the kids and the young psychiatrist are getting into the dream to save the others who have been taken and to get rid of Freddy. They will not all come back, but they will come back after Freddy's destruction by the junior doctor burying the bones and sprinkling them with holy water before covering them with earth. It is the first time the christian theme is brought in with holy water and a crucifix, hence with a parallel to vampires. The film then is a new twist in the general fabric invented by Wes Craven and it is quite effective. We must go on in this saga to see where we are going, where we are taken to. Be sure Freddy will live forever and ever, ever after the end of each film.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",0
"In this eye-opening book, author Chet Cunningham pieces together oral testimony from the surviving members of the Marines and civilians and weaves a startling picture of the battle itself and the horrors that the men were forced to face as POWs.On December 8, 1941, the Japanese launched thier first attack against Wake; a scant five hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor.    Eight of the Marines' twelve F4F Wildcat fighters were either destroyed outright or damaged so badly as to be unflyable.  For the next fifteen days, the Marines and civilians endured daily bombing raids.  On December 11, the Japanese tried an amphibious landing, but this was beat back by the defenders at tremendous loss to the Japanese.  Three destroyers were sunk, a light cruiser heavily damaged, and hundreds of Japanese sailors and Marines were killed.  However, this action only offered a brief respite for the Wake defenders, for on December 23, the Japanese returned in much greater numbers and successfully landed on Wake.After much savage fighting in which the Americans inflicted much greater losses on the Japanese than they suffered themselves, Commander Winfield Scott Cunningham, perhaps somewhat prematurely, decided to surrender to the Japanese.  Major Devereux was in charge of passing the surrender order to the surprised and angry Marines.  Many contimplated mutiny and threatened to continue to fight, but in the end, all surrendered to the Japanese.  This surrender began the defenders' three and one half years as POWs.In no greater battle have the Marines fought so bravely against such unbelieveable odds.  These men held out for fifteen long and stressful days against an enemy who was better equipped and more numerous than themselves.  The amount of damage they were able to inflict on the Japanese is staggering considering there were less than 500 Marines on Wake.  It is a true testament to their skill and desire to survive that they held out for so long.This book gives a unique look at the battle as told by the members of the Wake Marines.  The stories are heroic and horrific at the same time.  Many of these men charged into battle with little regard for thier own lives.  Their only objective was to stop the Japanese, which they did very effectively.  The story of the Japanese POW atrocities brings to light the mistreatment that these brave Americans were forced to endure for forty four months of captivity.  Surviving on very little food and water, these men survived on sheer will and determination.  The acts of cruelty that the Japanese took out on these men is simply unforgivable.  Its no wonder that so many of these brave Marines called the Atomic Bombs an act of deliverance.  If not for their use, they would have been forced to endure a much longer time at the hands of the sadistic Japanese.I found this to be a very interesting and eye opening book.  Many historians can write about a particular battle, but the only way to get a true sense of how it REALLY was to be there is to hear it from the survivors themselves.  These heroic men tell their tales in graphic detail.  Each aspect of the battle is described; from the initial bombing to the thwarted invaision, to the surrender.  These men were the first heroes of the war.  Their heroic example served as a benchmark for all future battles.  It is a testament to their will to survive and thier guts that they managed to hold out so long.  Read this well-written book and learn first-hand what it was like to face the Japanese and slap them in the face",1
"The first song I heard by Bonnie Tyler was ""It' A heartache"" many years ago and liked itvery much. but over the years my copy was lost.  One night while watching the PBS station in our area, Andrew Lloyd Webber's 50th birthday part was being celebrated by various guest artists performing his songs.  Bonnie Tyler's performance of ""Tire Tracks and Broken Hearts"" brought back fond memories of ""It's A Heartache"".  I remembered how much I enjoyed her music in the past and am now collecting her CDs.  This CD is the first of many.  ",0
"   Gone with the wind is a novel packed with action, love, distress, hard times, and most of all, scarlet's strong sense of lofe.  be it love of the land person, or thing scarlet is so emotional its almost unreal.  it is an amazing book and i reccomend it for anyone with atleast a 9th grade reading lvl.   I think that the views expressed in this book about slavery and the civil war are more realistic than in any other book i've ever read.  for instance,  although uncle tom's cabin was another great  book i believe that the viewpoint on slavery is too dramatic.  i do not believe that all southern slave owners whipped their slaves.    i hope that reading this review has encouraged you to read this book.  Gone With The Wind was deffinitely a book i can and will always remember, and i can't wait to read Scarlet, the sequel",1
"This fabulous book is about the author's experiences teaching English and learning martial arts in China after finishing university. Able to speak both Mandarin and Cantonese, Salzman penetrates deeper into the society around him than other foreigners could, and picks up friends and teachers along the way. Besides his numerous Masters, all of whom coach him in a different type of wushu, or martial art, he also has guides for calligraphy and even fishing. The characters he meets, all impeccably mannered, are hospitable and eager to exchange skills. Readers will greatly enjoy this book and the author himself, a slightly eccentric teacher and avid learner who writes well, among his many talents",1

However, having taken a number of his classes, and using this text as a starting point for thesis research, I can say it's a great starting point for someone intersted, not just in the headlines, but the reasons behind this critical national security issue.Too often in America, we're only interested in the newspaper article and soundbite, not caring for the deeper reasons behind a particular event.  This book delves beyond the mere events of today, reaching forward (and back) years, if not decades",1

"What would Jesus do? Miller's play brings that phrase to mind as a repressive Latin American country prepares for the grand spectacle of a crucifixion. A popular rebel has captured the attention of the common people. That miracles have been performed is common knowledge, people changed by their encounters with this man. General Felix Barrieux orders a crucifixion, certain that a prompt response to the temporary celebrity of this man is the perfect lesson for the citizens, an assertion of the state's power. While perusing an agreement contract from a US advertising group proposing to film the event for seventy-five million dollars, the general is confronted by his cousin, wealthy industrialist Henri Shultz, who has recently been at his daughter's side after her failed suicide attempt. Henri's daughter has been profoundly influenced by the man her country wants to crucify and Henri himself is desperate to convince Felix of the foolishness of his plan: ""People are desperate for someone this side of the stars who feels their suffering himself.""Felix is dazzled by the money offered for filming the crucifixion, unwilling to believe Henri's assertions that there will be commercial breaks for the sale of sundry products. Seventy-five million dollars can purchase significant changes for a poor country. Anticipating trouble from the man's followers, the general has ordered troops to the site, prepared to ward off any violence or interruptions. A cross is erected, nails at the ready, when the rebel escapes custody. No undue chaos erupts at this news; the man can be easily recaptured. Stanley, an apostle, appears, explaining that even the rebel is uncertain, on the one hand compelled to meet his fate, but on the other wishing only for the life of a mortal man, ambivalent about accepting the mantle of son of God. The American director and producer arrive on the scene, the director rhapsodizing over the striking view, imagining American-made SUV's filmed against the backdrop of mountains and blue sky, but she balks when she learns she will be filming a man's death, her aesthetic principles affronted. The whole project is fraught with problems, Felix's display of power in danger of failure.Miller has perfectly captured the dilemma faced by a world where every event has a price, the ubiquitous media at the ready, history repeating itself in more modern garb. A simple crucifixion intruded upon by cameras and artistic temperament, the main character is unwilling to commit to his part in the play. At the crux of all is opportunity: the general is caught between avarice (on behalf of his country) and fear of the citizen's reactions; the Americans envision enormous profits at the box office from exclusive rights, the greatest coup in modern reality television; those inspired by the actions of the rebel are sorely tempted by the advantages of such an event, rising property values, increased tourist traffic to the region. Suddenly greed becomes the great motivator, an insidious infestation that has taken root in the modern world. Staring into the new face of humanity, Henri is abject about the future, where profit determines morality: ""The world will never again be changed by heroes."" Luan Gaines/ 2006.",1
On The Bank Of Plum Creek is about the Ingalls family's life in Minnesota. This story is about the hard and rough winter and the hard times they had with crops. It's also about the fun and excitement of school friends and playing along the water. I really liked this book and I think all ages would like this book too. It is the Fourth book in the Little House On The Prairie series,1

"As the System Test Team Leader for the Quality Technology area, I had to certify many of the tools and procedures used by Stephen Kan.  Prior to that, as a System Administrator, I had to run software metrics on those tools, like those shown in table 6.3.  As a design review moderator, I was charged with leading a number of IR, IE and I0 reviews.THIS STUFF WORKS!I can attest personally to the great effort and many find minds that worked together to develop and implement fine tools such as DCR, PTR, PTF and APAR, as well as the brilliantly simple, effective ways of implementing Continuous Quality Improvement techniques such as DPP.  What Kan has written is real-world honest and true, not some academic exercise.Kan is dead-right on the money.  If you want to track, predict and manage things in the real world, this is how you do it.  At PSQT '97, Tom Gilb told me that SEI should create a new CMM ""Level Six"" designation for the way Kan and the others at IBM Rochester have dealt with software quality.  That's how good the stuff in this book is.I am particularly impressed by how Kan has woven in not only his work and IBM Rochester as a whole, but also the work of others throughout the industry in such a simple, clear, easy to understand manner.  Yet, given that the book is an easy read, that many of the techniques are easy to do, and that I see this book on the shelves of many IT managers, it baffles me why so few people and so few companies actually implement this stuff.  I suspect that politics and corporate culture is what's holding back so many companies from enjoying the success, efficiency, and frankly the FUN of working in a continually measuring, continually refining work environment such as Kan describes.For example, Defect Removal Effectiveness is a very simple metric to gather.  In a typical medium sized software company, or in the I.T. department of a large company, the head of testing and the head of phone support could easily enough get together and compare the number of bugs found in testing the last release with the number of bugs found in the field after that release was deployed.  Both areas already have their problem logs, and if they can't directly pull counts and totals, it's typically only a few minutes work for the right programmer.  So what's the hold up?  It's not that the metric is hard to understand, or an academic exercise, or that the numbers are hard to get.  It's that people have a hard time admitting that ""their baby is ugly"".  The good of the company, stopping bugs from getting to the field, conflicts with the good of the testing manager, who doesn't want to risk admitting that problems got past them.Therefore, I think it would be a fine addition to this book if Kan could write another chapter which deals with the human side of the equation.  The book thus far presumes an interest in software metrics and appropriate management support from the top levels down.  What would move this book from worker's bookshelves to their desks, and keep this book open and used on a daily basis, would be some ideas on how to garner and build support for implementing software metrics and TQM practices across an organization.  People want to do this; that's why this book gets sold.  Unfortunately, people aren't empowered to do so, which is why many times this excellent book sits on a shelf.Paul Walchak",1
"I felt that this was an excellent resource for the research of how women are depicted in the media and how important it is to recognize even the smallest steps taken to debunk traditional stereotypes of women.

"I'm going to be honest, I'm partial to this book. I'm Indian, so anything related to India catches my eye. But I'm a stickler for good literature, and here, again, Irving shines. Regardless of the 600+ pages, I couldn't put this book down. Some say it is a little slow and dry, but that's India! Irving does a fantastic job on his research, this story is very true to life. The plot is gripping and exciting: dwarves, transvestites, actors, doctors, murder, suspense, intrigue. It has it all. I would definately recommend this book for the serious reader with an open mind concerning other cultures. It's also a great insight into Indian life as well. Five stars",1

"Originally scripted as a grim film noir homage, a series of financial dry spells stretched out the film's production schedule to three years, whereupon the screen story underwent as many dramatic changes as any of the hard-living bands from the music scene the film adopts as its backdrop.Star Chris D. insists in the supplemental features that the original script's noir aspects are what attracted him to the project, but it was only once he became involved that the thing took shape as a ""rock movie,"" with the added participation of D.'s friends (and sometime bandmates) like John Doe and Dave Alvin.  Alvin went on to create an eclectic and memorable score for the film (now out of print, sadly), with players culled from friends and colleagues from X, Los Lobos, The Blasters and other local heroes.Not every film could survive three filmmakers AND active contributions by everyone in the cast, but then it's a rare project that manages to pack this much simpatico talent onto one movie poster.Additional DVD extras include deleted scenes, a potent ""trailer"" (including several moments not in the finished film) set to a driving musical score, and a pair of loose, enjoyable commentary tracks.  Another welcome addition is Chris D. and The Flesh Eaters' vintage ain't-no-WAY-this-is-running-on-MTV music video for their classic ""The Wedding Dice"" (comically mangled by Chris Shearer in the film itself).Had it followed its intended ""straight noir"" course, BORDER RADIO may well have survived as an interesting curio; but as it turned out, the film stands as a fitting elegy to an era, both in its depiction of a musical phenomenon's sunset and for its unique collaborative approach to filmmaking.  That both still feel like breaths of fresh air twenty years on only stands as a testament to their legitimacy.Like so many of the ""lost"" bands of the music scene it salutes with unabashed affection, BORDER RADIO is ripe for rediscovery",0
"that I've ever read, anyway!  Being in my late teens in the late 70s i managed to catch the last few fleeting pre-aids years described in this book.  On the first reading i was just stunned by the beauty of the writing, and like many people i suppose, i recognised many of the characters.  Andrew Holleran obviously knew this world intimately, and even though much of the novel is rather painful and sad observation, it's a beautiful and real pain and sadness that many of us who lived through that period still feel from time to time when recollecting.  Don't get me wrong though, it's hilariously funny too.  There's alot of humour to be found in the madness of the club scene of the time, the drugs, the sex, the total abandon.  I'm throwing my head back even now and singing Patty Jo's ""Make me Believe that you Love Me""!  Edmund White doesn't say this is one of his favourite gay novels for nothing!  It's a masterpiece, and i still re-read it annually, and savour every page",1

"I have been trying and trying to find a Reiki Master to learn from for a little over 2 years (ever since I received my first session from a dear friend of mine). The prices were outrageous ($250 for first and second level, and $10,000 for Master level), and I read on many sites that the ""energy exchange"" of this much money was to be sure that the student was *sincere*. I am very sincere about my desire to learn and share reiki, but do not have that kind of money to *prove* my sincerity. I became disheartened by all of that, and had almost given up on ever being able to learn, because the cost was way out of my reach. Then I found Steve Murray's books and DVD's. I received Steve Murray's Reiki 1, 2 and Master level DVD's and his 1st, 2nd and 3rd books as a gift from my dad who knew how very badly I wanted to learn Reiki, and am now attuned up to the 2nd level (and will study at this level for some time before taking the Master Level attunement). A short time ago, my dad was hospitalized for a subdural hematoma. I channeled reiki to him in the OR, and he says that he thinks he became more alert sooner after surgery in part due to my channeling the reiki energy to him. Even his ICU nurse was surprised that he wasn't more sleepy. I give alot of credit to the medical attention he received during his hospital stay, and I can't thank Steve enough for making his program affordable so I could do this for my dad, and for realizing that there are many sincere people who desire to learn for genuine and very personal reasons, whether or not they have that amount of money to prove it. I highly recommend Steve's books and dvd's. His books are very easy to read and hard to put down, and will be great to refer back to. The dvd's are very meditative and powerful too, and I will be using them for re-attunements as needed. Thank you again for everything, Steve! Keep up the great work you are doing",0
"I've been ""The Beatles""' fan since my early teenage years. After the ""Fab Four"" went their separate ways, I've come from admiring Paul McCartney the most to John Lennon and then, I discovered George Harrison's ""All Things Must Pass"" and he's been the God for me since. The Quiet Beatle, ""the Dark Horse"" with his voice, his lyrics, his melodies, and his distinctive slide guitar style which ""attracts me like no other"" musician - I can't even describe what his guitar does to me. Listening to the favorite songs where George's guitar gently weeps, smiles, meditates, and talks to me personally makes me feel like standing by the ocean during the warm sunny spring day. The vibrating flowing sounds of his chords break down to the thousands golden patches of sunlight that reflect from the water surface and radiate in the air filling it with magic glow. This glow seems to reach my very soul bringing serene joy or bright sorrow.   ""Brainwashed"", sadly George Harrison's posthumous project is an excellent album with all 12 songs warm, sparkling, and melodious, some of them have been among my all time favorites since I bought the CD when it was first released: ""Rising Sun"", ""Marwa Blues"", ""Never Get Over You"", the opening song ""Any Road"", and of course, the one which gave the album its title, ""Brainwashed"". I have not listened to the CD for some time and I have been re-discovering it for the last few days. I can't get enough of it. I keep listening to the songs in my car, on my way to work and back and since it takes me 40-45 minutes of driving one way, I am able to enjoy the favorite songs over and over again. They are the songs about love, about the roads that take you anywhere, the journey of self-discovery, the look at the past and sorrow of losses - everything is in George's last album, his parting gift to us, to me. It is his last smile at the sun that he worshipped and his quiet and dignified acceptance of inevitable end, and knowledge that ""The soul does not love. It is love itself/It does not exist. It is existence/It does not know. It is knowledge itself."" ""Brainwashed"" is one of the best albums of my favorite musician whose guitar will never stop gently talking to me.",0
"This is a movie about the student experience under the exchange programs made possible by the EU. As someone who has studied in the U.S., Germany, France and now the UK I know first hand what it means to adapt to different cultures, how important it is to overcome stereotypes when dealing with others and how full of funny or slightly awkward situations life in a multinational environment can be.I can truly say that the movie in parts describes exactly what I experienced throughout my student life.I was disappointed to read that the film was considered 'predictable' by another viewer. Firstly, i dont necessarily believe this person is right, secondly, the director is attempting to portrait the life of a group of multinational exchange students in a more or less realistic way whilst simultaneously making those people laugh that have never experienced life in such a context. Therefore, of course common stereotypes or misunderstandings have to be dealt with as this is what it is like in reality. I would recommend Auberge Espagnole as an introduction to anyone who is planning on spending a year abroad (please do so, it is the best experience you will ever have!) but also to those who just want to learn about what it feels like to have one foot in your home country and one foot somewhere else in the world.

"I consider myself a serious aquarist with a setup that cost me over $3000 for my overly spoiled Koi and fancy goldfish. I recently moved from Pennsylvania to New York City where the water quality is not nearly as friendly toward goldfish nor consistent coming out of the tap and so I find myself testing the water many times in between scheduled water changes from the tank as well as the faucet.I can't stress enough how convenient it is to dip one of these strips and be done with all the testing in one shot, but also consider that the liquid tests are not much more economical.Each strip costs around $0.20, and with 5 tests all done within about a minute.Even if you are doing the regular liquid 'drop-tests' for Ph, Nitrate, and Nitrite, those tests typically run at best $0.15 ($0.05 per test), and you're looking at a few minutes for each individually.

But while he sings about Jesus and lives like he is a prophet, there is no substance to him and his music. Lame beats, hypocritical lyrics, this is the core of what is wrong in secular music today. His interviews show him as arrogant, racist, and unlovable, but it is selling his music and that's what he cares about. So while his rapping voice is mediocre and his rhymes are abysmal and his life is lukewarm, he is sure to sell records galore and people will adore his hypocrisy (and their own hypocrisy). So let's be real for a second, because I am about to give you the best CD you will hear in years - it's a mixture of rap and rock, with (real!) beats, acoustic guitar, splashes of piano, and a voice that can sound like Chris Martin of Coldplay one second and then rap like LL Cool J the next...buy today Mat Kearney's ""Nothing Left To Lose."" The best CD of 2006 and without an ounce of hyprocrisy while being true to himself",0
"What can we expect of our troops which might or might not come home in the future from the hell they now have made?Watch this film and consider the effects of war upon our military people in the field now.Watch the scenes in the mental hospital, and realize we are not being given the entire story about our people desesrting and suiciding now.The meaninglessly over-used term Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome was created for the multitude or majority of Vietnam-era vets returning to the States unable to re-adapt in peace but who would explode with violence, losing homes, families, jobs and any normal and stable connection with our society. And because the Nixon-Ford VA had no budget, category, nor political interest to care for the damage it had created, the men went homeless until dead.What awaits our military should they ever finally come home.Watch this film. Watch Jackknife. Watch only the very first half hour of Johnny Rambo, up to his escape from jail, and where he remembers holding his dying friend's guts after an encounter with an Improvised Explosives Device. Watch Born on the Fourth of July, and wonder what awaits us long after this BUsh packs up. Notice the Iraq vets running for COngress are Democrats.Get over what you have heard about Jane Fonda, or Voight. They were both awarded for their work in this movie, for a reason. Watch it. We need it now more than ever. ",0

"There are only a handful of books out there, and this book is the best one so far. I know, because I have browsed through them all. Where as other books talk a lot in detail about the browser level AJAX process, most of them fail to explain [in detail] how to make AJAX technologies work with server-side scripts. That's where this book is different; there's plenty of PHP code with most AJAX examples to show readers how the whole process works.The first few chapters have enough information to get a novice started with AJAX. And if you know your html and web development already, you'd be AJAXifying your sites within hours. I highly recommend this book",1
"Powerful, disturbing, funny, redeeming.  Those are four words to describe this, Nordan's finest work.  It's a back-and-forth foray into the past of Sugar Mecklin, one of the most likeable Southern boys since Huckleberry  Finn.  Sugar tries to come to grips with love, life and geography by  returning to the stories of his late childhood in Mississippi with his  lovelorn mother and drunken, Elvis-jacket-wearing daddy.  It's painful at  times, but so beautiful that it's the kind of book you wish you wrote",1
"Not many band's greatest cd comes on their debut album, but in System's case it's so obvious to me that this is their most energetic, heavy, and best all-around performance. Most fans believe Toxicity to be their greatest cd, and they have a very good case. That's also an unbelievable cd, but I really believe this self-titled debut album to be the best. S.O.A.D. is easily one of the most unique bands out there. With Daron's creative guitar style and musical inventiveness, and Serj's extraordinary voice, and then Shavo's great bass playing, and John's different drum style, this band was destined for fame. What I love about this cd is that you can tell they had a great time writing and playing the music. Just listen to some of the humorous lyrics and Serj's screechy vocals. Daron doesn't get the credit that should be asserted to him. He is the primary song writer for this band and many times, it's confused with Serj being the main writer.There are no bad songs whatsoever on this cd. Every song has a certain energy to it. Spiders and Sugar are the most well known on here, but my favorites are Darts, Peephole, Suite-Pee, and Know. Serj's angry political chants mix together greatly with Daron's heavy guitar playing. If you've seen the music videos for Spiders or Sugar, they're really weird and different. Check em' out if you haven't yet, they're pretty cool. I think System's first three cds are all worthy of 5 stars. Mezmerize was a 3.5 in my book. And Hypnotize was a 4. I wish they'd go back to the heavy, hard hitting days like the 1-3 cds.Get your self a copy of this cd. It's #1 in System's catalog. They really bring a weird,different, incredibly great sounding cd up to the table. It won't dissapoint. As always, most of the songs are extremely short, but there are 13 of them. This is how I put their cds in order- Best to Worst.1.System Of A Down2.Toxicity3.Steal This Album4.Hypnotize5.Mezmeriz",0
"Within my awareness, this is the best author on the physics of lightning (voltage, current, charge, speed, event sequence, frequency of occurrence, length/width of channel, temperature, etc). Related subjects such as injuries, death rate, damage, protection, thunderstorms, harnessing power, etc are also discussed. The book could use updating with data acquired in the last 16 years (1986-2002). An improvement to the book could be more info on lightning protection. Another book by Uman, 'Lightning', is less general and more technical about the physics of lightning",1

"The more I read about Lincoln the more I realize what an incredibly extrodinary man he was. No one book can cover all of the complex person Lincoln was, nor of all that went on while he was alive.What this book does is paint a very complex picture of the man and his life. Every page is very well written and very informative. You just can't put this down.One of the best books, not just about Lincoln, but also about the Civil War",1
I really enjoyed reading this book.  It has reinforced my committment to place my daughter on a primarily plant-based diet.  Who wants a overweight and sick child?  I am so glad this book came out while my child was young so I can implement these good eating habits early on,1
I read Sweet Savage Love when I was 15 yrs old and I remember not being able to put it down it kept me glued to the pages.Steve and Ginny were both amazing strong willed characters and this book is not for those who are expecting political correctness.Bravo to Rosemary Rogers I have read all 4 books in this series and I wept reading the last installment Savage Desire wishing the saga could go on perhaps with either their son or daughter.,1

I frequently get into all sorts of hand-waving strange arguments with people, about &quot;musical works&quot; (e.g. my pseudo-&quot;composition&quot;/appropriation work &quot;Your Life Up To This Moment&quot;), and in Lydia Goehr's book, I found a very useful framework for thinking clearly and critically about such things",1

"This is the only marriage/relationship book I've been able to make it through - and I look forward to it every week! We take turns reading a chapter to each other weekly, and in addition to the topics being very real to life/couple issues, the discussion questions give you an opportunity to better understand and learn about your spouse. We also like how each week it asks you to select a particular upcoming challenge we'd like our spouse to pray for us about, and a concrete kindness they can offer us - this really gets us in touch with what is going on with the other. Highly recommended!",1
"Julie Powell has produced a worthy five-star entry in the comedic memoir genre.  Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously tells the story of a talented, 29-year-old secretary (originally a would-be actress) whose life seems to have passed her by until she unearths her mother's worn copy of Volume I of Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking (or, as our heroine terms it, MtAoFC).Julie's plan is simple (well, sort of).  She will cook her way through Volume I of MtAoFC in a year's time, shopping for ingredients after work, cooking a new meal nightly and blogging about her results in the morning. As anyone who has lived in New York will tell you, this plan has complications if you live in Long Island City, Queeens and are commuting to a job in lower Manhattan.  Neither neighborhood is heavy on elite butcheries and markets (it's more like ""Do your best with the Korean place on the corner""), and Julie's daily commute is a dreary 45-minute or so slog through a hellishly overcrowded subway system.  Nor is Julie's kitchen particularly well-equipped for the task-- grimy and rickety would be more apt.So, Julie Powell has indeed embarked on a year of cooking dangerously and, happily, hilariously.  Add to the above setting some eccentric-- but endearing-- friends, plumbing problems, a citywide blackout, dustballs, pet cats (no, they don't end up in the pot), a perfectionist mother who makes ample use of the ""f"" word, and a kind-hearted but long-suffering husband and you've got a perfect read for before-bed, plane trips, beaches and rainy afternoons.That Ms. Powell finds a measure of fame and, perhaps, fortune by the end of her year with Julia Child is only fitting.  Any deeper message?  Undertake that project that captivates you-- the crazy one that just won't let go.  Living your passion can open unexpected doors.",1
"This book was my first choice since we are trying to conceive our first child, but upon reading this book I feel like we must change every habit and completely re-design our bodies in order to get pregnant!!! Now, it's a given you quit smoking (we're non-smokers) and cut back on the alcohol but some of the information is far-fetched. It makes you wonder what IS safe to eat, which over-the-counter medications are safe even if not trying to conceive! My wife and I wish we would have read Amazon's reviews BEFORE buying this book, we would have saved our money and had a little more self-confidence. The sad part is, even though this author is a convicted felon he will still make money off this book!!",1

"Bill Broxton is a DEA agent who has been assingned to protect Prime Minister Ramsingh of Trinidad. His superiors want the man protected, because he has been co-operating in the war against drugs. They've learned that the drug barons from the Salazr Cartel want the prime minister dead, but Ramsingh complicates Broxton's life by refusing his protection, as he believes his own justice minister can do the job.Meanwhile the drug lords have hired the international assassin called the Scorpion to assissananate Ramsingh and guess who is part of  the cartel. You guessed it, none other than that justice minister who Ramsingh is counting on for protection. Now make the mix here a bit more interesting by making the Scorpion the girl Broxton wants to marry and you really have the makings of a good story. One I couldn't put down.This book takes place in the Caribbean and Mr. Stewart uses quite a bit of sailing terms in the book, but he does it in such a way that it adds, rather than detracts from the story. It's easy to see he knows what he's talking about when he describes the scenes at sea. In addition to the convincing scene setting and description, Stewart has also painted people we care about and who seem real. I enjoyed this sea-going adventure story and I think you will too",1
"This is the smallest dictionary I've ever owned.  Just over the size of an index card (and less than an inch thick) this dictionary actually deserves the term ""pocket.""  On top of that, it actually has a surprising number of words.  While you wouldn't want to use it for studying, it's good to carry around or have sitting beside you while watching or reading something for quick reference.  It's become part of my normal French routine and I wouldn't trade it for another dictionary at or below this size.  It's just amazing",1
this book is really good. i loved the variety in pictures (and so did my friends). it has the right amount of information and is organized well. i got this book one day before i bought my cairn terrier which i'd been considering getting and the information here really confirmed that this was the right dog for me.  i am also going to get a training book but for those wanting to know about this breed this is a complete book. i highly recommend this !,1
"I read this book because of I thought it was going to be funny, and it was. But I was not expecting to learn anything new, having read several books on investing. So I got a pleasant surprise when I actually did learn something.

"If you don't have immediate access to the internet, look it up in this book. It will give you a thumbnail description of almost any subject. It won't be detailed, but it will have the gist of what you may need to know. This book is the off-shoot of a previous book entitled ""Cultural Literacy, what every American needs to know"". Read it as well, if you are majoring in education, or any related subject. Both should be required reading for anyone contemplating teaching as a profession. As a college instructor myself, I can tell you that your students will come to you with practically no knowledge of history, geography, politics, government, philosophy, arts, or literature if they were educated in America's public school system. The challenge you face trying to educate them is monumental. These two books will help you to get a head start on knowing what you need to do.Rene Navarre, MBAInstructor, Remington Colleg",1
"""They Poured Fire On Us from the Sky""  is a deeply moving account of the many years of wandering endured by three of the lost boys from the Sudan.  It is an inside look at war from a child's point of view; a quick read, yet a difficult one, because of the severe hardships these young children experienced over such a long period of time. Our book club was touched both by the simplicity and intimacy derived from the first person accounts and by the strong values conveyed--lessons on resilience, family, loyalty, and determination.This is an excellent choice for a book club, and also for older students (high school level). There is much to discuss. Educators especially will find the book a good read, since even as they are nearly starving to death and wrought with disease, these young boys placed a top priority on becoming educated",1

"A Modern History of Hong Kong presents a supremely well-balanced history of this former British imperial possession. Steve Tsang's meticulously researched historical narrative duly recognizes the efforts of both Hong Kong's industrious and civic-minded local Chinese population and the expatriate British who held the bulk of the administrative power over Hong Kong during its tenure as a crown colony. Tsang's work demonstrates that Hong Kong's ethnic Chinese inhabitants played an essential and dynamic role in the creation of the former colony in that they constituted its economic, industrial, and infrastructural workforce from the beginning, and came to develop their own unique Hong Kong identity as the population stabilized culturally but exploded in number in the decades following the Second World War. Tsang's historical account never strays far from what students of Marxist theory would likely refer to as Hong Kong's material conditions, in that the book portrays Hong Kong's cultural development within the context of its economic and political circumstances. The work puts forth a history of Hong Kong in which the colony's unique social and cultural characteristics were established as a result of the relatively minimalist legal and political framework that was provided by the British colonizers in order to ensure Hong Kong's capitalistic success. Students of history, English, postcolonial studies, comparative literature, and other academic disciplines will find this book to be a fascinating primer for further studies into both Hong Kong's history and the colonial and postcolonial initiatives of Britain and other Eurasian countries. General readers and academics alike who are interested in Hong Kong's history will find Steve Tsang's book to be a lively, entertaining, and fair treatment of the forces and events that led to the formation of this former colony and to the creation of its current identity as a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China",1

"A wonderful introduction to and overview of the works of one of the only coherent intellectual &quot;schools&quot; of the 20th century.  Jay describes the penetrating insights (and weaknesses) of the thought of Adorno, Horkheimer, Marcuse  et al., with mercifully little of the psychologizing that one often finds in intellectual history.  Ideas and their relation to historical context are the focus, rather than personalities and psyches.  The book is readable enough to be attractive for non-academics and academics alike. It would have been nice to have more on the post-1950 period, but the as the subtitle makes clear, this is beyond Jay's purview for this book",1
"When I first saw this film, I attended a sneak preview on a saturday night in Palm Springs. It was a sold out showing, the audience was cheering, laughing and applauding. I was right there with them!!!! Goldie Hawn is gorgeous, hillarious and brilliant here!(isn't she always?!!) Mel Gibson is equally good. The teaming of these two actors was awesome! Action, comedy, romance, this box office blockbuster has it all! A classic that gets better with each repeated viewing.

"This CD was my first Jon B. injection. The first time that I heard his talent was through the track ""they don't know"", from this point on, I was hooked for life. There are artists out there that releases a CD that only contains a FEW songs that you can listen to, but with Jon B. and ""Cool Relax"" all his tracks are something to look forward to. Everything from ""Shine"" to ""Tu Amor"" is worth listening to and worth every penny that you're going to spend on this CD. You can't go wrong! If you're a fan of Babyface, Boys II Men, 112 and so many others in the R&B family (like myself) then you're going to love Jon B. He's not only hot, but he has a voice to back up the success in his career",0

"This collection is a great anthology of Manfred Mann's Earth Band. Whoever said that the only good songs here are two Bruce Springsteen covers, in my view, does not have full constitutional rights. There are numerous treasures here, including the magnificent ""Davy's On The Road Again"" and ""Circles."" True, there are a couple of songs from THE ROARING SILENCE that I wish had been included, but overall, unless you want to spend the unfair prices for the original albums, this, THE ROARING SILENCE, and NIGHTINGALES AND BOMBERS are an excellent way to start your collection of Manfred Mann's Earth Band",0
This book seems to be comprehensive in its treatment of digital audio but unfortunately much of it is simply cut and paste from more technical articles with little attempt being made to digest and explain the material in a more accessible fashion.  For example the material on error correction on CD's hits the reader over the head with equations that come out of the blue and the reader couldn't hope to understand in a month of Sundays.  The material on analog to digital conversion is much the same.Nonetheless this book serves as a compilation of relevant topics in digital audio but fails to provide the reader with the intuition to really internalize the material. ,1
"If you have kids or not, this Lullaby CD is cool.  Many of Metallica's great hits are put into lullaby form, which sounds truely amazing.  I bought this even though I don't have kids yet, because knowing my luck, the CD probably would not have been in production any longer by the time I had kids.  Plus, I play it when I go to bed, it is very relaxing.  Let's just say Sandman comes faster when this CD is played",0
"I first read this book when it had been out only a few years, and it turned my head around.  I had been brought up, like most children of the 'fifties, to think of life as a series of rigidly defined serial roles:  first you were a student, then you were a worker, and finally you retired and got to do all the fun things you'd been putting off for the past 40-odd years.  Having worked my way through graduate school, and done a bit of traveling in the process, I of course knew how artificial these distinctions were -- but I still tended to feel vaguely guilty about my &quot;immature&quot; lifestyle and rebuke myself for not &quot;settling down&quot; like a Real Grownup was &quot;supposed to.&quot;  Bolles set me straight -- in fact I was doing a pretty good job of balancing growth, work, and leisure in my life, and had nothing to be ashamed of.  My subsequent work history has borne out the wisdom of his advice:  I've been happiest and most productive when my life achieves that same balance;  the most miserable time of my life was the nine-year period when I succumbed to the siren song of Silicon Valley and became a money-obsessed workaholic.  This is a terrific book, and one that bears rereading every few years, especially when you feel your life slipping out of balance",1

"I'm biased because of emotional ties to Brooklyn, but since we moved after my son was born, I was very happy to find and read him this book.  It reminds me of the kids on our street there, playing games with what they find - and sticks are pretty harmless as far as city finds go.  The illustrations are BEAUTIFUL.Max consistently answers ""what are you doing with those sticks?"" musically, not verbally - which isn't necessarily how I want my son to communicate with me, but since we listen to and play a lot of music here, I think it's a good book to show the range of communication, and to show that it's ok to do your own thing without constantly explaining yourself.  While it might be strange to some that Max answers their questions with music, it's actually stranger that people ask absent-mindedly what he's doing when they can see and hear what he's doing - playing music!!  Max has his head on straight, and in the end is rewarded by a parade of musicians passing by, with one passing a pair of ""real"" drumsticks to him.  It's a nice touch, that while his family doesn't get him, other musicians do.  Again, I think this encourages kids to have confidence in doing their own thing.  (Can you tell this is a resounding value with me?!)While I'm writing about the plot, I think a serious asset to this book is with the illustrations.  My 3 year old doesn't rush to turn pages, he really takes in the drawings.  He is very verbal and communicative, but I think this book adds another dimension to his book collection",1

"The best and most unusual thing about this book is that it is more balanced than most: while most sprawl-related books are pure attacks or defenses (or are too superficial to adequately cover either side of the argument), Gillham gives a significant amount of space to the arguments, counter-arguments and counter-counter arguments on both sides (though on balance he is definitely more antisprawl than not).  In addition, the book covers a wider range of issues than many sprawl related books; instead of being focused on quality of life issues (like most New Urbanist books are) or on environmental issues, Gillham goes into both.   Also, Gillham discusses the political lineups on sprawl related issues: who's for changing the status quo, who defends sprawl and why",1
"Molnar's book is a wonderful introduction to human genetics, variation, and racial classification (that is, race is an illusion), just as the title suggests.

For example on ""A woman's worth"" she had the guitar playin a funky melody that was absent in the original.  Another one is when she sang ""You don't know my name"" and in the middle of the song the band busted out the beat and melody from Black Moon's ""Who got the props""!  Now I know many people won't know what the hell i'm talkin about here but if you do, then that's all I have to say to convince you that this joint is worth buying just for that",0

I am now breastfeeding my 3rd child and even a ""veteran breastfeeder"" like me benefitted from this book. I cannot recommend this book high enough.",1
"The entire GITS universe, whether it be the original manga, motion pictures, or the adapted TV series, are all heavily philosophical so I'm not sure why the last reviewer bothers to complain.  These next episodes set up the confrontations later with Kuze to illustrate his true intentions as a radical reformist but needs the cover of a terrorist to strike fear into the government.  The episodes are consistent, driven, and well acted so I can't see giving this less than five stars.  If you're not able to unweave the philosophical web of dialogue that GITS (or The Matrix) lays before you then I suggest you find a brainless action film that the general public is used to having explained for them...you'll only get frustrated with this kind of complicated thinking",0

How can we know what is going  on with our blood sugar. I wish I had been handed this book when I was  diagnosed.  If you are confused about what is happening to you when your  blood sugar drops,this is the book for you!!",1
"There have been many books published in the last three yers about the building of the WTC, the attack of 9/11, the collapse of the building, the architecture, the decisions, the rebuilding, and so forth, but only one book about what went on at the site immediately following the collapse of the towers.William Langewiesche  is an excellent essayist and reporter, and managed to both situate himself in the middle of the rebuilding- the only writer to do so- and to be a neutral enough observer that he was able to tell the story from all perspectives. The public story- the heroism of the firefighters and police, the harmony on the site- dosn't quite hold up in Langewiesche's telling. We see internecine fighting, looting, distrust, and outright hostilkity between different groups competing for control of the site and for glory in the minds of the public. But we also see an extraordinary effort by almost all concerned, and an operation in which public and private organizations came together to do an amazing job of cleaning up the site in record time. We also see the City of New York rising to the challange, brushing off Federal attempts to control the site, knowing that the city has more experience as disaster recovery and cleanup in its numerous contractors and building officials than the whole of FEMA. City officials and contractors came together and mapped out strategies and divided up work without waiting for approval from higher up authorities. An excellent piece of reporting and interpreting. Highly recommended",1
"This book is an example of what a business book should be -- plain advice about how to go about starting and running a business.

"This is a great little movie, very witty and hilariously tongue-in-cheek. As a self-conscious sendup of the 1960s Doris Day-Rock Hudson romantic comedies, it is a very particular brand of humor that may not appeal to all. Still, my sister and I, who never saw the originals upon which it's based, adored it. It's not a movie that forgives inattention: much of its humor derives from clever and intricate wordplay. The four leads do a great job, and the sets, costumes, and music are fantastic",0
"  A spate of volumes on Islam have come out in the last decade. The author, Alvin Schmidt, was able to take advantage of all this new scholarship to draw the proper conclusions about Islam. The author then condensed all the pertinent facts that back up his conclusions, and put it all into eleven, easy-read chapters!  I especially appreciated pages 24-26 and 289 where Alvin Schmidt addresses the ""Allah was a Moon god"" debate that is raging, mostly via the Web. There he mentions that Yoel Natan has a lengthy book coming out on how Allah was a Moon god.  This all shows exactly how cutting edge Alvin Schmidt's research is, and it shows that he does not shy away from controversial topics, either! This is the kind of book I want to read on Islam",1

As a Protestant convert to Orthodox Christianity I had the usual misgivings regarding the elevated role of Mary in the Orthodox and Catholic Churches. This book gives a thorough and scholarly approach to how marionology developed over the centuries in both the eastern and western traditions of the church. It was very helpful in enabling me to better appreciate why there is such a veneration of Mary even though there is not much biblical revelation about her. The most surprising thing to me was the Muslim connection to Mary. This book will certainly fill in your knowledge and appreciation for Mary and how she developed into such an icon of the church,1
"This is not the worst book I've ever read, but it is very close!  It had potential to be a good read, but lacked in many key areas.  The characters were fairly interesting and decently developed individually, but the  outcome of all their interaction was not develped nearly enough.  The  entanglment of the characters had good plot potential, but ended up being  VERY anticlimactic.  I felt like the book was unfinished and probably  needed at least another hundred pages or so to round out the characters and  their situations.  It even felt as if it was published exactly as the first  draft was written, without any content editing, rewriting or further plot  development.  Every Day is Mother's Day is a book that had promise, but  fell quite short of it's potential",1
"This (and it's super cheap little brother) are some of the most hyped items in audiophile land.  I approached the super-T with skepticism:  I mean it's a 10 wpc amp with a cheesy outboard power supply.  How good could it be?  The answer is very good indeed.  In my setup with Athena AS-B1.2 (super cheap $99 speakers with high 90db sensitivity), very good speaker wire (Straightwire Maestro - yes it's worth more than the rest of the system - but it was lying around) and a G4 iPod with losslessly compressed rips the music is forceful, tuneful, and involving.  This combo's strengths are jazz, female vocals, folk, pop, and small ensemble classical stuff.  Hard rock and orchestral stuff sounds a little small.  Its zone of competency is very wide, however - and within it bass is rich with great pace.  Trebles are sweet and extended.  The midrange is lush and tube-like with incredible presence.  Vocalists sound like they're in the room and I frequently stop what I'm doing (the system is in my kitchen - so I'm usually cooking) to listen - a very good sign.  This level of musicality at this price is outstanding.  This system blows away my mid-level system of Dynaco Stereo 70 amp, NHT model Zeros.  I swapped the Dynaco (a classic tube amp with 35 wpc) into the kitchen system and immediately noticed the loss of bass impact and high end clarity I enjoyed with the Sonic Impact.  Caveats?  First of all - it's a very low powered amp.  That means you must use very efficient speakers or it will not bloom.  Second, your output is only as good as the source.  Make sure you use a source with great resolution or you're just wasting your time.  I've heard you can upgrade the power supply and get better sound.  It wouldn't surprise me.  This unit begs to be tweaked in general.  I can attest it sounds great out of the box.  This isn't a true integrated amp.  It offers only one input.  The only controls are a volume knob and a power button.  For me this is ideal.  You don't need a pre-amp!  The cheaper Sonic Impact T amp doesn't have binding posts (uses clips) and has a plastic body and a smaller power supply and smaller on-board caps.  It's also only $40 - but tweaking is manditory on that unit.  I think the extra money is well spent for this one.Considering that the Sonic Impact/Athena AS-B1.2 system is less than $250 and rivals serious systems - I don't see any competition as a stay-at-home iPod system from the purpose-built iPod systems.  A CD/DVD player would also make an excellent front end.   Is this a giant killer?  I don't know.  I didn't put it up agains the ARC Classic 60 in my family room.  I don't think it's fair to put a $140 amp up against kilo-buck gear.  In the sub $1000 price range it's a monster and a paradigm shifter - even given its limitations.  If you listen to the right music - and have the right ancillary gear, you will not be disappointed",0
"African Holocaust brings up images of true roots regggae as soon as you listen to it. It however doesnt need to have a full track list of roots tunes to do this. With dancehall-influence from both Capleton's cameo on ""Blazing Fire"", and Damian ""Junior Gong"" Marley's brilliant toasting on ""No More Weapons"", the songs have a heart full of roots rock reggae, and the mind of the ever-increasing politcally aware youth. A surprise was the Bob Dylan cover, ""George Jackson"",  which is a faithful ode to the Soledad Brother.  The album also contained another song about the framing of George Jackson (and subsequent murder by a prison guard in the yards at San Quentin) which was a previous song by Steel Pulse called ""Uncle George). Overall, this should be in any rock, reggae, roots, or hip hop library",0
"That the publisher is a university press should be a tip-off that this book is not a page-turner. Barbara Milberg has a story to tell, or a series of stories. But although she is an English professor, or perhaps because of it, her book is painfully overwritten. The choice of anecdotes is puzzling - some are just silly and do not display Balanchine to advantage, nor do they enhance the author.  Life in a famous ballet company seems tedious indeed. So many memoirs of George Balanchine and City Ballet have appeared that those with memories left are slicing the pie ever thinner. The editors at Wesleyan University Press should have taken the scissors to this manuscript, as well as applying a dose of judgment. And was there no copyeditor? How can an English professor and former dancer misuse the word ""principle"" on page 13? This does not inspire confidence in the manuscript. I think Milberg may have told her story so many times, to so many people, that she lost perspective somewhere and no longer had the the reader in mind.  I know serious dance researchers will find the kernel of information in this book, but they will have to search. Writing is like dance - it should make people happy. I was not made happy by the overly garrulous storytelling that weighs down this memoir. It is totally lacking the airborne quality. ",1

"I remember reading about an event in the life of Dr. A.W. Tozer.  Tozer was asked by a young man studying at a Bible school, ""Dr. Tozer when the boys begin to debate Arminian and Calvinistic theology, what position should I take.""  Dr. Tozer replied, ""Son, when they begin that debate you go and get in your prayer closet and you cry out to God and in four years you will be closer to the Lord but those boys will still be debating Arminianism and Calvinism.""The age old debate over Calvinism and Arminism continues to this day.  Nearly 500 years after John Calvin and Jacob Arminius, we still have no pat answers.  I have heard people say that they are neither Arminian or a Calvinist but I believe you will fall into some position whether you realize it or not.  In fact, Dr. Olson makes a profound statement when he wrote, ""I believe that even most people who call themselves Arminians are really semi-Pelagian"" (p.10).  And he goes on to add that some who call themselves Calvinist are not truly Calvinist.  This book seeks to do two things.  First, Dr. Olson wishes to show the true history of Arminian theology.  Too often Jacob Arminius is misunderstood by modern evangelicals.  Calvinist often believe that Arminius believed in ""works salvation"" but he did not or that he did not believe in depravity but he did.  In fact, Arminius believed in predestination and election but he differed with John Calvin and his followers over predestination being conditional or unconditional.  Arminius believed in salvation by grace through faith (Eph. 2:8-9) and he believed that all of salvation was by God's grace!  The second half of this book exposes the reader to the errors often accused of Arminians.  For example, Olson shows how Calvinist often think that Arminians are not orthodox nor true evangelicals (Charles Spurgeon even questioned Arminians salvation).  Olson shows how the heart of Arminian theology is not belief in man's free will or the denial of God's sovereighty, predestination, or justification by faith.  In fact, at the end of this book you will see that Calvinist and Arminians agree on quite a number of issues but differ over the conditions.Overall this is an excellnt book.  I have found various Calvinist blogs trying to attack Roger Olson and the book.  I found Olson to not be angry at Calvinist.  He simply wants to write a book on the history and development of Arminian theology and he has done quite a good job.  He includes Scripture as well as many footnotes to back up what he is trying to accomplish.Does this book end the debate?  No it doesn't.  But it does present Arminians and Arminian theology in a whole new way.  It shows that grace still is important and is the true heart of Arminianism",1

"This book is awesome!!!  I'm 26, have sewn from patterns (and modified patterns) since I was 10. But with this book, I've found a more satisfying and immediate approach. I read reviews of several draping books, and this seemed the most straightforward.  Since it was created specifically for an class, it if full of instructions and specifics. Most of the excercises show a bulleted list of steps, broken down simply, that you just have to jump in and do. If you try to read for comprehension, you'll never get it. Very hands on, and very to the point...............I mean, there's no BS from a grandma who taught herself to drape boxy quilted blazers, and then gives tips on where and how to bedazzle said blazers.  Which is the approach that about 99% of sewing books take. I mean to say that it is timeless, ageless, and just what you need to feel confident in making whatever you imagine.  Order this book! Buy a form and some supplies and show us what you've got!!",1

"You can find in this story all the dirty tricks that you can imagine to emotionaly engage an audience and make it reach a tear-splashed climax. First you have the Romeo-and-Juliet style love affair between the two main characters: the shocking love choice of a muslim girl by a hindu man that makes them abandom their families and native village, where life would be impossible, for the more tolerant atmosphere of the great city of Bombay. When we have already begun to feel more relaxed, seeing they have comfortably (by Indian standards) settled in Bombay, and that their families have finally accepted the marriage after a pair of twins have been born to the happy couple, we must get ready to suffer in earnest. The infamous riots of Bombay begin. And then the film presents the dirtiest trick: the children of the couple will have to suffer the unleashed violence of ethnical and religious hatred. We,as audience,suffer along with the parents, who are afraid have lost their children forever, but we are nevertheless mercilessly shown the results of this violence of neighbour against neighbour in hard, impossible to forget images (such as the one when the protagonists look for their children in a hospital ward and in a morgue), of course without gore-ish details, as is the canon in Bollywood, but by this time you must be made out of stone indeed if you are not crying your eyes out. Another thing we are shown, and this is quite a common message in the Indian cinema lately, is how the riots are the result of the politicians'/religious leaders' vicious manipulation of the people's  minds.Although the political message of the film is very plain, to the point of being of pamphlet quality, and the emotional dirty tricks are felt as so many blows below the belt, it takes Bolliwood to make from all this tricky material a gripping story that has the audience watching on, with a lump on their throat, for three hours. You can also find more levels than just the purely superficial in the movie: there is always the symbolism, so dearly loved by Indian cinema, as in the case of the twins and their fate. And there are some subtler messages: when one of the boys gets lost and is in danger of being trampled to death by a terrrified mob, he is rescued by an eunuch. And it is this most despised and marginal of members of society who, while tending to the boy's wounds and feeding him, finally explains to the boy what religion is, and what is the difference between a muslim and a hindu.As usual with Bollywood films, there are musical numbers, but in this case we don't have any major star of India, although the main actors are great (she is especially charming in the style of Audrey Hepburn); but you have to watch out for the support actors: whenever the two fathers-in-law (one of them a very pious muslim, the other a very pious hindu...always having commical clashes)are in a scene the screen rocks!",0
"David Goldfield does an excellent job at discussing how white southerners have justified the purpose of the civil war.  He sites examples of politicians and how they have used racial issues in their favor.  The book also discusses how southerners has &quot;changed&quot; the civil war and reconstruction so that it portrays its' people in the best light.  I have read other race/cultural books (&quot;End of Rasicm&quot; by Dinesh D'Souza &amp; &quot;America in Black and White&quot; by Stephan &amp; Abigail Thernstrom) and this book is the first one that offers a good EXPLANATION of why things occurred as they did down south.  It was also timely because of the recent comments of former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.  In fact, Mr. Lott was discussed in the book regarding his speeches at meetings with the Council of Conservative Citizens.  I recommend this book because it is well written and it tells the truth about the most intriging part of our wonderful nation, The South",1
"One Love. A Bob Marley hits compilation.INTRODUCTION:Bob Marley. Over the years, he has reigned supreme as the ultimate name in reggae music. Despite passing away in the early eighties, his music remains consistently popular. And it isn't hard to see why, as it really does stand the test of time. Despite dying young, Marley's career contained a plethora of music, and as such, many compilations of his work have been released over the years. The most popular compilation of Marley's work, though, would have to be the Legend compilation, released in the middle of the eighties. However, Marley has a number of other, lesser-known compilations. How does the lesser-known One Love measure up? Keep reading and find out!OVERVIEW:Bob Marley's One Love compilation was released in 2001. The compilation features twenty tracks, spanning many years of Marley's career. REVIEW:Bob Marley has a LOT of compilations, no questions asked. None of these compilations are bad, by any means. In fact, every one of them seems to succeed in areas that others don't. Legend is the best-known of all of Marley's compilations, and it isn't hard to see why. It was a single-disc, affordable compilation that hits all of the high points of Marley's career. However, just because Legend is the all-around best-known and most widely revered of all of Marley's collection does not mean it is the best one. One Love is an underrated gem of a hits compilation. For the most part, the tracklist is similar to Legend, but there are some changes. The set drops one track from Legend, Satisfy My Soul, and adds seven others. Also, this compilation uses the full-band version of Redemption Song, rather than the acoustic one that was featured on Legend. The order of the tracklist also got a total revamp. While Legend featured a non-chronological running order that was well suited for it being a ""party"" album of sorts, One Love uses a chronological order. I have always preferred chronological retrospectives in that they show you how the artist evolved over the years, and it works excellently for Bob Marley. Granted, some people may prefer the non-chronological running order of Legend, and it's not hard to see why they do, really.  OVERALL:No matter which Bob Marley hits compilation you buy, you'll get a damn fine overview of his career. If you're just the casual Bob Marley fan who wants an affordable, single-disc overview of his career, you have come to the right place. Despite not being as well-known as Legend, this set is nothing less in the quality department. If you're a casual fan or just someone who is seeking an affordable yet effective introduction to the music of Marley, this is just what you need. Highly recommended!EDITION NOTES:Sadly, because this compilation is not as well-known as the classic Legend compilation, it is not as readily available. For that reason alone, you may want to go with the single-disc remastered version of Legend. Still, if you can find One Love, it is a worthwhile set",0
"There are now hundreds of books about the Fourth Way and about the people who have influenced and contributed to it over the years. There are also other books about the practical aspect of work on oneself. These written endeavors often times face the almost inescapable limitation of being merely a dry menu listing of ideas on the subject. And from a practical pov, clearly missing is the essential person-to-person contact a student only receives with direct relationship with a teacher. However, as far as these books can go in giving a taste of Work toward Being, this one does and is a very positive contibution to the canon of the Fourth Way literature. Rarely does one encounter a book of the depth this one embodies. If you imagine that the working with these ideas is basically an intellectual exercise, then this book will probably disappoint. But if you are interested in peering deeper into the actual experience of the ideas and Work on Being, then this title can be of value. Not meant to be read as a ""normal"" book, each reading is a wealth of insightful thought and perspective and calls for the reader to look deeper within their own experience. ",1

"We discovered Gráda in a live performance at FitzGeralds in Berwyn, IL on Valentine's Day 2004. A group of us went at the spur-of-the-moment because we had out-of-town guests who wanted to hear some live music. We knew only to expect a five-member group from Dublin. Our small group ended up being half the audience, and it felt like such a thrill to have this outstanding group almost all to ourselves! Their performance was spirited, technically demanding, and yet seemingly effortless. They have a full, rich, well-balanced sound, and their compositions are nicely arranged. Gráda moved effortlessly between original compositions with influences from New Zealand and more traditional Breton selections. As the band took the stage, we knew with the first song we were in for a treat. We immediately grabbed the cell phones and started calling friends to come join us and hear this amazing group.

"This is the second book I have purchased with Joey Lott and I have to say it is much better then the Remoting book but not by much. This book also has some examples that DO NOT WORK. Its rediculous to put examples in that are of no use. Besides that I really don't like his teaching style. He can get really confusing as he uses far to many terms to describe one word. Not only that but he switches as he pleases making you spend a lot of time back tracking trying to figure out what he is referring to. He also takes the long way around and I found myself taking a lot of notes to weed through and separate the learning from the babbling. It was really frustrating and I wasted so much time where I could have been learning. I have found better from instructors who are clearer, detailed and to the point. This book would probably be a few hundred pages less if he would do that. We would learn just as much. This (like others have stated) is definitely not a good reference book nor is it a good book for beginners but if you are an intermediate and you have already gone through some tutorials or other books written by Joey (that way you know how to decipher his teachings/blabbering) then I say give it a try. I got a lot of good notes deciphering his stuff into people terms which I have learned a lot. ",1

"Professor Wood admits that, in contemporary America, only the most intrepid minds dare question diversity's exalted stature as a cultural ideal.  So it should say something Wood's disregard for his own reputation that he has written this book, which assails the ideal of diversity on page by page pace.  I will admit that I bought this book hoping to see just this kind of thing-to see a credible author and skilled mind slay diversity in a ""public setting.""  Of course, it's only a public setting if more people read the book.My own antipathy toward diversity took root during my undergraduate experience at the University of Nebraska, where diversity pervaded official policy, speeches, campus news articles, and student government.  Not despising diversity, I merely became irritated with its omnipresence, the way one might tire of a food group if forced to eat it at every sitting.  In short, I was unaware of diversity's true malevolence before reading this book.  But Wood documents diversity's self-contradictions, its empty thinking, its threat to individualism, its corrosive impact on higher education, and more.  In higher education, for instance, Wood attacks race preferences for admission (carried out in the name of diversity) and notes that, at the U. of Michigan, a white applicant to law school scoring between 163-165 on the LSAT and holding a 3.25 GPA has about a 23% chance of being admitted.  A minority student with the exact same academic credentials has a 99% chance.  I mention this in this review so that the potential reader can get a feel for the content of this book.Of higher education, Professor Wood also points out how diversity is cleverly used as a two-faced recruitment tool.  Diversity is marketed to white American teenagers, Wood says, as a way to escape the social narrowness of their high school experience-as a ""romantic mingling"" experience with ""the other"".  But diversity is then marketed to minority students as an assurance that they will feel welcome at State U., where increased recruitment of students of color will offer minorities a safe haven from the crush of the predominantly white student body.  Fantastic observation, because it's true, and it reveals diversity's opportunistic nature.Despite diversity's grotesque track record, Wood also realizes why diversity has maintained a near universal following in this country-it seems to command us all to be fair, helpful, open-minded, and above all, to avoid judgment of other people, other beliefs, and other ideas (is that such a good idea?).  As Wood argues, despite diversity's more noble exhortations, we as neighbors, citizens, and co-workers can better achieve good will and social betterment if we set aside silly race-based distinctions and look instead at individual merit.As an example of how holistic Wood's view of diversity is, take one of the early chapters.  In it, Wood draws on his experience in anthropology to relate how Americans in the 1800s and early 1900s were avid readers of books and compendiums that provided rich, unabashed descriptions of the world's geographic and cultural diversity.  True diversity.  He contrasts this bygone interest in the world's people and places with the new diversity, which Wood argues accentuates slight differences between people (black Americans, white Americans, Hispanics, etc.) and asserts, against the evidence, that the differences between us are gigantic.  Furthermore, he chastises contemporary Americans for believing themselves to be educated about and sensitive to cultural differences, whereas, these same Americans believe, past generations were parochial, ignorant, and unappreciative of these differences.  ""It is a sad delusion,"" he writes.Although it wasn't the most enjoyable segment in the book, the best work Wood does (from an author's and researcher's point of view) is when he traces the growth of diversity from an LBJ speech through the Supreme Court's Bakke decision through the 1980s and then today.  Wood's treatment of the Bakke case is remarkable in its detail, and is sure to startle the reader when one realizes how a marginalized, fringe idea (that there is real, measurable educational value in having a diverse student body), set forth by Justice Lewis Powell, spawned the monster we wrestle with today.  Overall, Wood takes a topic that had great potential to be tedious and academic and turns it into a delightful read that manages to deal with diversity comprehensively and delicately without compromising the reader's interest.  Flat-out, this is a great book.",1
"I had written Paul Weller off after subpar outings with the Style Council.  After the urging of a friend, he persuaded me to pick up this title.  After listening to this, I realized Paul Weller going back to his roots  with The Jam.  Although it is much more mature than his old school days, I  enjoyed this outing very much.  His writing style has come back with some  middle aged anger which made me very pleased.  Fans will not be  disappointed",0

"Once in a long while, amid the untold millions of merely clever, ingenious, entertaining, new, or unique books the world has written for any of its lesser reasons, you will find one that is piercingly and profoundly true, written only for truth's sake.  This is such a book.  While simple, it is anything but simplistic.  Careful reading combined with honest self-reflection and genuine efforts to be good will not just uncover many important issues, it will uncover THE issue.  This book is no new revelation on the nature of man and his morality, but it reasons upon truths the rational will see as self-evident, the religious will recognize from scripture, and the empirically-minded will perceive in the honest assessment own their own experience.  Any serious attempt to explain human nature that does not incorporate the truths discussed in this book risks being fundamentally flawed and is assured to be incomplete.  I wholeheartedly recommend to you this book",1
"I've recently started reading the Christie mysteries I've missed along the way, including this, her second full-length Poirot.  I found it tough going at times, somewhat confusing...but I've rarely been so blown away by the denouement of a whodunit!  I can only imagine that this was the book that cemented Christie's reputation after her debut with ""The Mysterious Affair At Styles.""  Sure, the writing is old-fashioned (it was written in the late 20s, after all), but the intricacies of the plot and the way Christie keeps you off-base and guessing until the very end are simply stunning.  You may not have heard of this Christie (it was new to me), but it truly ranks up there with ""...Roger Ackroyd"" and ""...the Orient Express"" for sheer suprise value",1

"Amidst the turbulent sea of box office smashes on 1939 like Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of Oz, not to mention the start of WWII, this black and white masterpiece seemed to have  past beneath the waves into obscurity.  It is such a classic that the acting remains believable even today, 65 years later.  Don't believe me? Just try to sit through with dry eyes, the scene wherein all in the bunkhouse awaits the 'end' of poor ol Candy's dog who is put to sleep by the gun of a cagey ranch hand.  Alot of films this old lose their believibilty and lustre, as acting techniques and directing gets more sophisticated, however Burgess Merideth and Lon Chaney Jr prove two hard acts to follow.

"I am a voracious reader and watcher of fiction and nonfiction murder, mayhem and mystery and no one has ever irritated or disturbed me more than Scott Peterson.  I really really needed this book.  In my bone marrow I know that people who are hurt, hurt people.  And yet through the entire Peterson brouhaha, he and his mother (his father seemed almost invisible -- I can't even picture him anymore)irritated me so that I could scarcely bring myself to consider that the two of them were anything but the most crazy-making, breathtakingly arrogant people I'd ever watched.  I'm grateful, after reading this book, to have empathy and compassion for both of them now.  ""There, but for the grace of God, go I.""  It might have been me.  It could have been me.  While the egregious, evil, cold-hearted brutality of Laci's and Conner's murders is over-whelming, waaaaay over the top, and absolutely beyond comprehension, so, too, is the damage done to Jackie beginning as a two-year-old; and so, too is the damage done to Scott from the moment of his birth.  Scott and Jackie are broken people.  Mark Garagos didn't pay any attention to how broken Scott and Jackie were.  I would not necessarily expect that to make a difference in the outcome.  I would hope though, that it might somehow make those of us who were so harshly judging him take a step back and ask ourselves what might we have done in the same circumstances. Dr. Ablow, thank you. Thank you so much. You hit the nail right on the head. I very much appreciate the message and admire the masterful leanness of the language you used in a situation that easily could have lent itself to morbid, contaminated, pathological excess.  A much-needed job well done. It was my lack of compassion toward Jackie and Scott; the steel in my feeling of superiority (arrogance); my total inability or desire to even consider that they might not be monsters, that was making me crazy.  It was making me like them",1
"This movie is a movie about contrasts, with a stunning compilation of varying colorful scenes.First, the theme of the movie is about polar contrasting ideals, a local culture that revels in masculine ideals and romantic escapades with woman who idolize and treasure attention from men.  This is contrasted with the isolated, withdrawn culture of the nunery.  Second, the colors and lighting of the scenes correspond to the contrasting cultures of the film, the scenes taking place outside the nunery are full of color and sunshine, while inside the colors are drab and plain.  Ultimately the contrast has an effect on all characters of the film those on the oustide, the general and local Brit respect the determination and innocence of the nunery and the sisters begin to feel a longing for the romance and excitement of the outside. This film will sincerely impress you with its images, as well as is powerful, yet unspoken, themes of romance and sexual desire.  I never thought a nun could look so sexy, just wait until the one Sister changes her appearance towards the end",0
"I don't consider many things to be worth 5 stars, but this book deserves the full board. Throughout university, I read multiple career choice books and took numerous tests to help me find my path, and was left wanting. Within the first hundred pages The Pathfinder had taken me in a more meaningful direction then all of the books and test I had done before - combined. The progress with The Pathfinder doesn't come easy. It takes time and energy, and you're going to have to ask yourself some tough questions and be willing to answer honestly. Some people might not be ready to do that, I know I wasn't until recently. If you think you are ready to find a career you love, get this book.

This book is not only an eye opener but it also expresses Kevorkian frustration with the governments control over medicine.

"Sports Car International is, by far, the best automotive magazine currently being made. This is the magazine that Road and Track, Car and Driver, Motortrend, Automobile, and all the others wish they could be. This magazine is a little more pricy and it only comes 6 times a year, but that does not diminish its excellence. This magazine has far fewer subscribers than the big names, but that doesn't stop it from consistently having the most beautiful photographs, the best writing, and the least ads. While the big names have endless pages of advertising, SCI has few. Also, this magazine is one of the most focused ones on the rack. You won't find Honda Civics, Cadillac Escalades, or any other crappy vehicles. The magazine reviews more than sports cars alone, but they do an excellent job limiting the coverage to &quot;sporty&quot; cars. The variety is also overwhelming. If you subscribe to Motortrend, you might get 3 or 4 sporty cars in one issue. The very first issue I bought had reviews of the BMW M Coupe, the Ferrari 360 Spider, the Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona, the Aston-Martin Vanquish, the Aston-Martin DB4, the Porsche Carrera 4, and others. The motorsports coverage and features relating to the automobile industry are also second to none. If you love exotic and sporty vehicles, there is no other magazine to get",0

"This book if not for business majors , engineering students and psycology students. This is an EXCELLENT book for statistics undergrad/grad and PhD students.I spent over 10 hours weekly just reading the book every week. Plus my assignments will take another 10 hours . So be prepared for a 20 hr week.YOU NEED TO TAKE A BASIC STAT / INTRO STAT course before this. If you dont know the meaning of P-values , T-test , F-test , DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. This book will not introduce you to those things. Unfortunately many buiness schools ( including top 10 ) dont offer a good intro stat course, so buiness majors jumping in to this course is a wrong idea.This book is also a ""good to own book"". The first 15 or so chapters has regression and the second half ( next 15 chapters ) has DOE (design of experiments). GREAT BOOK ! One piece of advice - make sure you learn to use SAS with this course . In real world applications many industries are using SAS. Even if your teacher insists on using R package / splus , YOU MAKE SURE YOU know how to do those things in SAS . There is a SAS student manual with this book, specially written for this book . buy it ISBN - 0-07-302177-6good luck !  ",1

"Chinese Silk: A Cultural History by Shelagh Vainker (Assistant Keeper of Eastern Art, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, England) is a detailed history of silk in China ranging from its Neolithic origins down to the twentieth century. Relating the use of Chinese silk to other decorative arts, and drawing extensively from archaeology, paintings, poems, and other texts, Vainker traces the role of silk in Chinese history, trade, religion, and literature. Chinese Silk is an impressive and seminal work of outstanding scholarship, would make a superb choice as a community library Memorial Fund acquisition, as well as an essential, core addition to academic library Cultural History collections",1
"Jayber Crow may have sat on the back seat of his church, but there is no way the reader of Wendell Berry's book can be so detached from its characters and story.  It is a warm, rich tale of human lives that affects all who venture to its pages.  In addition, Mr. Berry is a master writer.It appears that the Jaber story is written on two levels, but when I asked Mr. Berry about it, he did not seem to agree.  Perhaps this is the kind of analysis he asks his college students to pursue and is better left in class.   Whatever the case, as a fellow Kentuckian I can vouch for those who say he has a good handle on small town life in that State. He also has the ability to show the lives of the ordinary Port Royal citizens differ little from those of central New York City.The book is a masterpiece        ",1
"This is my favorite cookbook.  I have had great success with everything I've made from this cookbook! The recipes are widely varied (plenty of breads, meats, sides, desserts, and vegetarian options) and healthy.  While Weight Watchers does have slighly lower fat recipes, I feel these recipes have more flavor and are more fulfilling.  My guests are always shocked when I tell them dinner came from this cookbook - low fat does not mean lacking in taste! (tastes great and is filling) ;)I got this book when I was first married, and have used it almost weekly since.  It was great for me starting out, because it contains tips for beginning cooks, kitchen basics with essential kitchen tools, the recipes had common ingredients, and there is a subsitution chart in the back! (invaluable, especially when we still had dial-up internet access!)  It has a fair amount of pictures, though not one for each recipe.

"In this long-awaited sequel to The Giver and Gathering Blue, Lowry satisfies our curiosity about the now familiar characters of Jonas and Kira and reintroduces the street urchin, Matt, from Gathering Blue. Those readers unfamiliar with the first two books in this trilogy will still be moved by the familiar theme of utopia gone bad as they follow the story of Matt (now called Matty), who is 6 years older and has grown to become a responsible youth under the loving care of the blind man known as Seer.  Matt and Seer live in Village, an idyllic town on the edge of a menacing forest that welcomes all newcomers, especially those who are escaping from miserable lives elsewhere. But Matt is confused and frightened about the changes that are taking place in Village, particularly the practice of ""trading"", in which a villager gives up one thing to gain another. Matt looks up to a man named Mentor, a former teacher, who is changing before everyone's eyes as he ""trades"" parts of his inner self in order to gain the love of a village woman.  When the villagers vote to close the gates of Village to all newcomers, Matty is sent by Leader (Jonas from The Giver) to find Seer's daughter Kira to convince her to return with him before it's too late.  Along the way, Matty discovers his own gift as a healer. The difficult choice he must make regarding the use of his gift parallels the choices made by Lowry's previous protagonists, Jonas, and Kira (from Gathering Blue), and we are again absorbed in the agonies of a young person who has the power to save his world from destruction. Lowry's strong writing and clever imagination regarding the sinister possibilities of Utopian worlds make this novel stand out as a worthwhile sequel to her other works. The book is probably better when read after the others, but will surely create much discussion, especially in regard to the powerful and moving conclusion",1
"With this excellent book, Robert Jastrow has written a good, easily understood overview of the Argument for Design from the perspective of cosmology. He first presents the reasons why there is a consensus among scientist for the Big Bang theory and an expanding universe (particularly convincing is Penzias/Wilson's radiation from the cosmic fireball). The universe is not only expanding, it is doing so at a controlled rate that allows for intelligent life (a bit faster start would have lead to rapid expansion, slower leading to an early collapse). He then leads the reader to the obvious questions raised by the new cosmology; who did it and why. Why did the Universe begin in an explosion? Did the Universe exist before that moment? Why does the Universe seem designed for life and for man? A nice extra is the final chapter by Steven Katz; Judaism, God and the Astronomers. He argues that Judaism permits freedom of ideas, and that interpretation of Biblical texts is a long tradition. He quotes Maimonides, saying that the writers of Genesis used metaphors, ""in order that the uneducated may comprehend it according to the measure of their facilities and the feebleness of their comprehension; while the educated take it in a different (i.e., allegorical or nonliteral) sense."" Other nice extras include the many historical photos as well as an index",1

Sera Beak's chapters on Sexuality, Meditation, Dreams and Prayer are a virtual 'how-to' for women of all ages to 'peel back the onion' of their existence and reveal their true selves. Ms. Beak's ability to expose the patriarchial nature of the world's major religions, frees women to explore the 'divine feminine' in their lives. Ms. Beak is erudite, witty and grounded as she shares vivid stories of her personal journey from a Masters Degree of Theological Studies at Harvard, to a visit with the Dali Lama on her 21st birthday. Like Gibran's 'The Prophet', 'The Red Book' can be picked up and read whenever you need a 'divine fix'.I highly recommend this book, and eagerly await her next one",1

I didn't remember a thing from the first reading.... I've been a Christian for many years, but find that this book is so fresh, with insights that are truly amazing.  For this new read, I bought two different translations so that I could read both and compare when the meaning seemed obscure.  I highly recommend the translation by Maria Boulding.  It does a great job of staying true to his meaning, while expressing things in a way that speaks to the modern mind. ",1

Her persective on life (before, here and after) is deeply wise, casting welcome perspective on what It All is truly about.  In the West we are proud of how many books we consume.

"I always assumed that the sexual division of labor made sense at one time in history. Barber has researched and illuminated one aspect of the division, and through archeology and linguistics explained the importance the women's work had at one time, and what happened to it. And made it interesting, too. Thank you",1
"I heard from a number of people that Amon Amarth were an excellent death metal band, so with that in mind, I though I'd try OSFTGH. What I hear, and it certainly seems I'm missing out on something, is sloppy musicianship and poor songwriting. Just because you have mead dripping from your beard, and you scream out lyrics that contain, no mercy, vengeance and ""it's your time to die"" does not mean you can create ""authentic"" Viking/metal. These idiots could definitely take lessons from: Enslaved, Manegarm, Falkenbach to name a few. Don't fall for the hype!",0
"I thought this book was extremely well written (except maybe for some of the over the top profanity), though sometimes having to double read some of the statements to remember them for future reference within the novel. It was a more challenging read than Gates of Fire, but it had more twists and a larger timeframe in which to include, and I reward it as a more distinguished tale to tell.I thought it was a fantastic novel, telling tales of Alcibiades (and Lysanders amung others) rise to legend through the lives of others who were in service to these men both directly and indirectly. It also tells tales of the greater battles fought (of course focusing on the siege of Syracuse and its aftermath), tactics and weapons used, formations, and general leadership of all sides. The book also had alot of focus on the democratic (if you want to call it that) society of Athens, while if one had already read Gates of Fire (or any other source on the Peloponnesian War) you would have already known of Sparta's elitist society, and how it was in complete contrast to that of Athens and her allies. After reading the novel, just about every key topic of the 27 year war (and alot of smaller occurences) were inlcuded, which was terrific since it was all joined together precisely. I also thought that the degrees of differences in each character were clearly forcast, which added a distinct amount of realism to the novel as well.I would however read a source or have taken a class on the Peloponnesian War (reading Donald Kagan's book is a great reference) just for some overview into the war itself, the timeframe, the initial causes and the characters themselves, since the novel would probably not make alot of sense otherwise.

"Who is Paulton and why did Maturin want to visit him?  Who were the ""men and women on the lists?""  Who is Padeen and why is Maturin so particularly concerned about him?  Is Padeen also known as Coleman?  Why would O'Brien give us a hundred pages with nothing more than the sights, sounds, and smells of Botany Bay, unconnected to any story line?  What did O'Brien feel he contributed to the story with the addition of the island children to the story?  If the essence of the writer's craft is to create and maintain tension, to keep the reader riveted, to entertain, to inform, then even the most avid O'Brien fan must admit that The Nutmeg of Consolation falls short.  I will admit that I found some of the Aussie argot amusing, as when we learn that ""purple dromedaries"" translates as ""little, small, bungling pickpockets.""  But trudging through the final chapters alongside colorless protagonists, I am sure that the reader will be as happy as are the protagonists themselves by the prospect of returning home.  This was the next to last book in the Aubrey-Maturin series, and I can't help suspecting that O'Brien's creative light had dimmed",1
"Web Copy That Sells is well written, easy to read and a great resource for improving your web copy.There are a number of points that Maria makes regarding web copy that apply equally to all areas of business as well as life.  For example, she points out that you cannot simply model some successful website and expect the same results.  You must model the process.  That is go through the same process that the creator of the successful website went through.The book is not only a resource for web copy that sells, it is also a very good marketing course.  She points out that potential customers must know you, like you and ultimately trust you before they will do business with you.  She provides a step by step method to accomplish this.Maria is right on when she talks about the importance of the first screen and why you must concentrate on what's in it for the viewer.  The website should not be designed as an ego boosting medium.  You must keep the viewer's point of view in mind.She provides a good list of dos and don'ts for web copy.  There are plenty of other tools such as a formula to evaluate any website.Scattered throughout the book are excellent marketing lessons - words tell, emotion sells - fear of loss is a better motivator than desire for gain.

Uncle Silas lived up to all the rave reviews I had read of it before purchasing the book. Le Fanu's characterization of  the Madame was convincingly sinister and he was able to create and maintain a meanacing and forbidding atmosphere throughout the novel. The climax was startling and apropos. What can I say? I love a good gothic novel with excellent plotting and characters. I highly recommend Uncle Silas if you wish to delve into Le Fanu's novels,1
"Competing by design is a great source for for anybody who thinks about organizational design. After having read it, you will never consider &quot;cocktail-napkin&quot; designs again, and you will recognize when you see a design created that way. The book doesn't only explain the basic elements of design, but also the do's and dont's of a design project. The structure of the book is very well-conceived, and the level of detail is just right: Focus on the important steps, best practices and lessons, with enough backup examples, and without boring repetitions or lenghthy explanations. I'm not sure you will sleep better after having read the book, as the size of the design project becomes clear, but you will certainly have the tools to make the process a successful one",1
"A lot of words been written lately about the unexpected revival of painting fueled by the current Gerhardt Richter painting retrospective captured in this book. It seems, according to some influential art scribes writing in the trail of this traveling exhibition, that the much heralded demise of painting, much like Mark Twains death, has been greatly exaggerated. Showcasing about 120 works over a 40-year period, this book is one of the most comprehensive retrospectives ever mounted about a contemporary painter in recent memory, and that by itself is a strong enough reason to buy it. However, it is what has been proven by Richters career and accomplishments, and unexpected stature in the art world (Sothebys recently dubbed him the most influential living artist in the world) and now driven home here, that makes this a-once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn some lessons about the contemporary art world. You see, Richter doesnt fit the formula for success that many art curators and influential critics and other art powers-that-be have carefully crafted in the rarified atmospheres of the upper crusts of the art world. In fact, Richter breaks every rule that often starts being pressed upon 18-year old art students and then is hammered home in reviews and lectures by many contemporary art critics and curators. Rules like you better have your own recognizable style! or only new is good and the oddest rule of all: painting is dead! But Richter is not only a painter in an era forced to focus on video artists, performance stars and PhotoShop wonders, but also Richter wanders from style to style with an ease and speed that makes this book a lesson on half a dozen art movements of the last century beautifully continued onto the current one. Thumb through the pages here and youll soon discover that Richter is as much as ease with photorealism  some ultra sharp and some foggy in detail -- as he is with pure abstraction and with romantic paintings of pretty clouds and scenic waterfalls. This is an artist who is not just happy with thumbing his nose at the well-enforced rule that a good artist has to have a clearly identifiable style and do something new, but who also seems intent on destroying the other forced formulas of the modern art world: he copies other artists works, works directly from photographs, blah, blah, blah  all sins that would make all my art professors and most art critics sigh in disgust. But above all, Richter paints, and he paints in a time when painting has been dismissed as ailing and ancient. New is good, technology is good painting is dead. Why does Richter paint? Doesnt he get it? NOPE!! Its because it is all about painting! And managing to make fools of critics who forget that their job is to follow the artist  not to lead the arts. What those who consider painting an ailing form will never understand (mostly because they are not painters), is that Richter cant and wont stop painting, because through his veins runs the same intoxicating venom that fueled their ancestral kin in the caves of Altamira and which will continue to drive painters long after todays critics and curators are forgotten dust. This book shouts: Art does not have to be new to be good, and technology is not the only venue to deliver great new contemporary art - it also continues to prove that painting will never die",1
"ASTONISHING SPLASHES OF COLOUR by Clare MorrallJanuary 9, 2005A favorite book of mine from 2004, ASTONISHING SPLASHES OF COLOUR was a great character study about a woman with Synesthesia who has a hard time coping with the world.  She seems to have the mind of a child at times, although she lives in her own place (across the way from her husband), earns a living by writing book reviews for children's books, and seems at first glance to be a very normal and stable adult.However, upon closer look, things look quite differently.  Kitty Wellington seems to be on the verge of falling apart.  She spends her days looking for her child Henry. She also seems to end up on the bus a lot, going nowhere, sometimes coming home early in the morning.  Her need to be awake is sometimes so intense, for she fears her dreams.  She also has a deep need to find out more about her mother.  Because her mother died when she was only 3 years old, she has very little memory of her, and what she does remember she believes are false memories. Her brothers won't help her, saying it's been too long ago for them to remember a thing.  Even her father refuses to help her out.  While at first her behavior didn't seem too abnormal, it comes to a point where she begins to do things that are totally irresponsible. When she begins to behave erratically, such as taking a baby that doesn't belong to her, her family realizes that she needs help, fast.  ASTONISHING SPLASHES OF COLOUR was a truly fascinating look at a woman whose mental state is slowly deteriorating.  It is difficult to like a character such as this, because often times the reader will not know whether to sympathize with her or be angry with her.  What I do feel, though, is that this was a great reading experience and it is a book that I will not forget for a very long time.  The Ratmammy gives this book 5 stars",1
"This book really changed how I look at home life.  The text is meaty and kept me up two nights in a row.  I had been grumping about how cramped my house seemed.  With a spouse, two dogs, and a cat our 2000 sf seemed, well, just not big enough.  After reading the book, and thinking about it, I saw the real problem, it was never a space issue, it was a stuff issue.  For the past two weeks we have thinned, sorted, trashed, donated and otherwise cleared out roughly half of what was in the house.  Now the house can breathe and there is space for us.  So, even if you live in a regular size space, or can't imagine living in a small one, this is a grand book.  It really helps you see the functions of a home and isolate your needs.  If you are working at living a simple, green or wabi-sabi life this book is a must. ",1

"Fleming and Koppelman have done a decent job of bringing the complex subject of Earned Value Management into perspective.  Starting with an interesting history of the subject from its beginnings in 1965, they have broken the subject down into its components and given a clear explanation of the fundamentals.  If you're planning on working in the EVMS field any time soon, I would recommend this as a good starting point to familiarize yourself with the subject. ",1

"If you read travel essays or travel writers, chances are you'll find your favorite writers interviewed here.  If you think you have read everything published by those very special authors and you just can't wait for their next book, think again.  You may discover a book or two mentioned that you have overlooked.  If you are like me, some of these authors' lives are fairly well known to you.  In other cases, some writer you have heard about forever may be a complete blank.  Now I know something about the rest of them.  And with so many of these writers on my list of regulars, I now have some new (to me) travel writers to check out.  I liked the writer's sometimes kind and sometimes very unkind comments about their colleagues.  Most of the writers are very opinionated; I suspect that is why I read their essays.   When most of the interviews were conducted, American politics was on everyone's mind.  It would have been surprising if no political comments had been made.  Had these interviews occurred in the 1990s, I suspect the political comments would have been  different.   So while I noticed that politics sometimes came up and sometimes not.  I don't believe that the book has an agenda other than entertainment and information.  This was my favorite Spring Break book.  I am already reading some of the books noted in A Sense of Place.  So that you know where I am coming from, my two favorite travel writers of Paul Theroux and Eric Newby-quite a spread.  But I really like them all, every one of them.  ",1
"The third and final installment in Kieslowski's monumental Trois Couleurs Trilogy is probably the most popular, and most humane of the three.The beautiful Irene Jacob plays a model, Valentine, who finds and returns an old man's dog, and subsequently gets drawn into that old man's world. The neighbour is an ex-judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant in a marvellous, layered performance of disillusion, horror, fear and disdain.) who has taken in his old age to spying on his neighbours via surveillance equipment.At first she finds The Judge pathetic but comes to see she is not as dissimilar to him as she may imagine.The acting is exemplary, the cinematography is superb and the story, while not wholly realistic (There seems to be a touch of ex machina deus, or divine intervention in Kieslowski's farewell masterpiece.) is very thoughtful, and considered.This is probably the most fully-rounded of the three films in the trilogy and in many ways the most satisfying - perhaps because it DOES ask the audience questions about fate, chance and the possibility of God.It is the late work of a grand master of the cinema. And although I must confess the first time I saw it I thought the tricksy ending in which Kiewslowski manages to tie-in the other two movies in the series a little sentimental and contrived, after several viewings over many years it becomes clear that the contrivance is precisely the point.This is a film with a great deal of questions to ask its audience and a number of provocations, and by this stage Kiewslowski had earned a little indulgence with his unlikely plot twists.Enjoyable, thought-provoking and breath-takingly beautiful, this movie - along with the other two in the trilogy - has had a profound impact on the cinema (particularly on European cinema, but not limited to; Sophia Coppola is a fan!) produced since and needs to be added to any sensible cinema-lover's collection.Outstanding",0
"Already being a big fan of both English church music and Rachmaninov's piano/orchestra works, I thought this would be a good purchase.  Though I'm not especially familiar with Russian choral work, I can understand how this might sound &quot;English,&quot; but I think that it's divine.  These voices are such a delight to listen to; I never knew that Rach was such a talented choral composer.  It is wonderful to hear the Kings College choir in such an ecstatic diversion from their usual works in English.  Well worth it",0
"This is a greate book about the way architecture affects the lives of people who live in it.

"This is quite simply an amazing, inspiring and thoroughly fun book.  I would have never attempted such a feat...but, what can I say, I got sort of swept up in the idea of it once I saw the fabulous pictures.  Now, don't get me wrong.  It did take some effort.  But not nearly what I would have expected.  The directions and instructions are perfectly detailed and clear.  The results were completely amazing...my first-try, never-ever-decorated-a-cake-before, came out as close to Debbie Brown's magnificent creations as I could have ever hoped.  The girls at my daughter's 7th b'day party ooooh'ed and ahhhhh'ed.  The other moms were blown away.  The only bad part is that now I'm looking for every opportunity I can to make another cake.  It was just too much fun",1

It give a thorough explanation of Symptoms, First Aid, Diseases and Disorders, Tests and Treatments.

There is a full-color photograph and illustrations section in the book called the Visual Guide. This section is helpful when trying to identify things like rashes and skin disorders and for reviewing anatomy.The other two books you should possess for starting your medical/health library should include a good drug/medication book (or use a website like www.medlineplus.gov) and a good medical dictionary (recommend Taber's, but MedlinePlus also has an encyclopedia/dictionary)",1
" "" Sounds And Stuff Like That"" is Q at his best. He seems to always get the best talent around to record for him. It dosen't matter if they're singing or writting songs for him. Case/point, ""Tell Me a Bedtime Story"" was written by Herbie Hancock.It no telling how Herbie would have done it if left to him. Now lets keep in mind that Herbie is a musical genius himself. But throw Q in the mix, and you have a song that is remembered for all time. Q can take an arrangement and make it better. The title track is another example of this. Being around Duke Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie helped him develope the Big Band sound that you can hear dominate every song on this effort. there is so much good about this effort that I can't list them all. ""Love me By Name"" sung by Patty Austin, ""Sounds And Stuff Like That"" sung by Valerie Simpson with the dominating vocals of Chaka Khan. This album is a prime example of Q taking great talent and making it better. Average Quincy",0
"This really is good-looking watch. Unlike other bracelet watches I have had, this one does not snag the hair on my arm. The face is slightly smaller than most standard mens watches, which makes a good fit for me because I'm thin. The matte color and dark gray face give a very tasteful look that works for just about any occasion, either dressy or casual.I liked this watch so much that when I lost the original one I replaced it with the exact model. (I bought the original about 3 years ago in a department store for about $240.)",0

Baptism in the Holy Spirit 2. whether some gifts have ceased 3. discussion on specific gifts, especially the controversial  &quot;sign gifts&quot; 4. practical implications for church life and 5.  dangers of author's position. A scholary, though not easy read, which  considered views of the gifts today. The book does not talk about specific  gifts but provided good views to the reader to decide for themselves about  the use of gifts in the church today based on the scriptural evidence.  Along with the Bobby Clinton book, probably the 2 best books on the  Spiritual Gifts in print",1
"I know this area is for reviewing the book Brokeback Mountain and not the film, but I had to respond to another reviewer's comments about the movie. I found my way to this page because I was so moved by the film I wanted to read the story upon which it was based. I am pretty picky and tough to please when it comes to both books and films, I'm not particularly liberal, and I rented this movie with no expectations beyond that it was a quirky little ""gay cowboy movie.""IT BLEW ME AWAY. I watched it three times. I can't remember the last time a film affected me like this. It stayed with me for days, mostly thanks to Heath Ledger's haunting portrayal of Ennis Del Mar. This is truly one of the best performances I've ever seen on the screen. This movie cuts to the heart as much because of what is not said between characters as what is said. It has startlingly few gay love scenes, and even those are nongratuitous and brief; in fact, the two male leads have more sex scenes with the women characters than with each other. There is more ""gayness"" in an average episode of ""Will & Grace.""I never doubted for a minute that Jack and Ennis were in love, it's in every gesture, every look, and the fact that they continue to see each other for over 20 years despite the risks involved. Remember that men especially in those days were conditioned not to express their true feelings, even when it didn't involve a social taboo. The Jack Twist character only solicits prostitutes because he yearns to be with Ennis but can't. He like Ennis is a homosexual man living in a time and place where he is forced to deny that reality and live a lie. If he was only looking for sex, he wouldn't drive hundreds of miles just because he learns that Ennis got divorced. He is even willing to leave his family to be with Ennis.Calling this a ""gay cowboy movie"" does it a great injustice. I don't think Ang Lee could have done a better job. It deserved to win the Oscar not because it's ""politically correct"" or it tackles a controversial subject, but because it's brilliantly written, directed, and most of all acted. If you haven't seen the movie yet and maybe are hesitating because you think it will make you uncomfortable, see it and you won't regret it. And if you're like me and had thought of Heath Ledger as a pretty-boy actor who did costume movies, you're in for a rude awakening. This film is one of the best I've ever seen, and I can't wait to read the story",1
"I've read most of the other reviews of this movie and many of the viewers didn't get the point. If you grew up as I did, in a family that was atypical and dysfunctional in the extreme, if you've ever been abandoned at an early age by a parent (as I was) and have held a grudge against that parent for cutting out (as I still do, although this movie has caused me to question my attitude as nothing has before), if you've lived a life where you saw and were subjected to great violence at the hands of intelligent yet disturbed human beings who were your family members, people with addictions and PTSD, this movie will resonate for you in a very special way. I found all the characters engaging and intensely *real*. I am one of the last people to get hung up on sentimentality. For someone to call this movie 'syrupy' or 'cheesy' indicates to me that this person has never experienced great depth of emotion, has never seen someone they loved lash out in pain and insanity and has not done anything in their lives they've regretted and wished with all their heart and soul they could go back in time and have another chance to do over again. This is a movie for survivors, for people who need to learn forgiveness for others in their lives and forgiveness toward themselves. Christopher Walken is a magnificent being and he seems to shine in everything he does. But Michael Caine is also very engaging in this film, as are the other performers. There is not one bad performance in this movie. Yes, it is difficult to watch. Yes, the emotions are strong. No, it is not syrup or formula. This is an amazing movie. For some of us, this is not fiction -- it is a powerful portrayal of less-than-perfect and far from ordinary humanity. I believe this is one movie that will, over the years, become perceived as absolutely legendary. There is nothing wrong with introspection, other than the fact that it makes many people (Americans in particular) uncomfortable. Shallow people looking for to be passively entertained should stay away from this movie -- go elsewhere. Thoughtful people who have lived life, carry a few scars around and ponder the finer points of existence -- please buy this movie and show support for it.",0

"I read this book while on holiday in Goa, India and I must say that it kept me spellbound from start to finish. What a page-turner this novel is! If you're at all interested in the workings of the human mind and if you want to see what complex psychotherapy is all about, then read this. I feel sorry for the reader who gave this book only one star, complaining that nothing happens. The story told is a masterpiece of psychotherapy-writing and should be included as a required text in psychotherapy institutes'training programs",1
"This CD looks like basically a compilation of ""Interstellar Stomp"" and ""Czar Wars"".   I own both of those and I can say that this is by far and away the best surf rock I've ever heard.   This stuff is as far beyond bands like The Ventures as are the heavens above the Earth.  I've found through listening to a good amount of surf instrumental rock that band either master the energy or the melody, but not both.  That is, they are either a high-energy frenzy of notes (think Man or Astro Man), or they craft melodies and play them deliberately (The Ventures), but the Space Cossacks have merged out-of-this-world energy with melodies.  There is a variation of tempo and mood as one listens to a Space Cossacks album that I've just never heard from any other surf rock band.  No throwaway stuff on Space Cossacks CD's.   Each track is a star with a unique beauty and energy of it's own in a greater universe of music.",0

Paul Gilbert proves he can do alot more than shred and I am so impressed with this CD! I owned cassette tape versions of earlier Racer X material and I love these as well. It must be a natural progression - and a bit of an epiphany for the artist -to rather re-invent and forge forward. Paul's solo work is getting better and better! There are so many tunes I like on this CD!,0
"When I saw this I was confused at first, only 3 1/2 stars for Meshuggah? After reading all the reviews I began to understand what the problem was. People like Meshuggah for alot of different reasons and some of those reasons aren't apparent on Contradictions Collapse. If you like Meshuggah solely for the complexity, Melodicness, or Weirdness of their later albums you should probably steer clear of this. If you enjoy the heavyness and intensity of Meshuggah or are just a thrash fan in genral I recommend picking this up today. Jens Kidman rules with his kind of James-Hetfeild-meets-death-metal vox. The guitars are crushingly heavy and hold your interest unlike alot of thrash stuff. The drums are some of the best I've heard and the bass is cool too. Basically, as long as you recognize that this is thrash and not cyber-futuristic-million polyrhythem stuff like their later efforts you will like this as long as this kind of music is your thing.  4 stars for what this is, 5 stars to counter the undue negative press.",0
"I read Friedman's book a few years ago, when as a foreigner I knew nothing about American law but became interested in the subject due to the political importance of US Supreme Court decisions. The decision to buy this particular book was rather random, but I couldn't have made a better choice.In this book, Lawrence Friedman gives a thorough, balanced and above all engaged overview of the development of modern American law. The book is divided in chapters organized by law subject, not by historical period, which allows you to read up on the development of any field of American law you are interested in. But at the same time the reader is never left confused about the historical 'big picture', as Friedman chooses the order of narration very carefully and ensures the reader is with him all the way. What makes the book better than just a good overview is the way Friedman manages to put the 'human element' into his narration without it becoming sentimental, dramatic or overly political. The impact of laws and decisions on the lives of various minorities or even just the average American gets ample attention, and one feels that Friedman is one of those rare legal scholars who manage to maintain a sincere and non-cynical interest in the effects of the law on common people. But by avoiding a preachy or bitter tone this engagement manages to hold the attention of the reader at a much higher level than the angry commentary of law histories on the left (Zinn) and right (Bork).In short, anyone with even a passing interest in American law should definitely buy this book. Especially recommended for non-American audiences",1
"This is Todd Snider as I remember him - at the head of the Nervous Wrecks touring with the Bottlerockets on the stage at Mississippi Nights in St. Louis - where I first saw him and where I keep him in my mind's eye.  He opened for the BRox there - local favorites got to close the show (which was cool enough by itself, but it gets better).  Now, I don't mean that this is a live recording - it isn't.  It is smoothly recorded, and professional in every way (as it was his last major label release, btw).  But the damn thing growls, like he used to do live - it has an immediacy that the others lack.  The material is performed with real enthusiasm.  Songs like ""Rocket Fuel"" and ""I am Too"" actually breathe fire, and ""I am Too"" features the best verse ever written in the United States, in any song, ever (you figure it out).   He has a song about Jesus on this cd that would make our Savior swell with pride.  And you can't find the cd anywhere in stores - the only place I've ever seen it is used on Amazon.  Buy it, and you will never be the same. ",0
THis book was very interesting and educating. I recommend it to adults as well as kids and teens,1
"I was 16 when I saw this production live at ACT in San Francisco, and quite frankly it is probably still the best live production of any of Shakespeare's plays I have ever seen.  When I discovered this recording, I had to have it.  You won't be disappointed when you watch this ""Shrew"" because it is so true to the original production.  I have bragged for years to my friends that I saw this production live -- now you can share that amazing experience!",0
"This is my favorite album from my favorite klezmer band.  Better than anyone else, they combine new forms with old.  Moxy Fruvous fans get a treat on &quot;Man With a Hat,&quot; a fabulous and exciting number.  This is a wonderful album.  Enjoy",0

"I decided to write this book review after purchasing this book a few years ago and to later find myself purchasing it again for a friend with an infant child who is in her own struggle of how to feed her child the healthy way!!  My friend was just like me....trying to do everything naturally possible for my child....but, totally confused as to the &quot;correct&quot; process!  In today's world so many people are trying to get on the healthy path, only to find themselves in total confusion as to &quot;how to begin&quot; and then, to find what they thought was healthy for their child,  to be working against them.  Bob Flaws has clearly demonstrated that even the most healthy foods can be the most harmful to young children......however, he also explains the reasons why and how to properly prepare foods to offer young children for optimal health.  My daughter is now 8 years old and through the knowledge of this book and a wonderful TCM doctor, we do not have the health problems we used to have.  My child loves her &quot;cooked&quot; vegetables and through proper management, she has a balanced diet every day - no junk food is allowed. For birthday's we have a nice healthy dinner minus the birthday cake, and a nice trip to the beach.  This book gives down to earth answers in our relationship to nature and the importance of eating the &quot;correct&quot; way.  It is a critical book for today's failing medical society as we teach our children the importance of natural health.  As I look around my community, I see parents feeding their children the most harmful foods and then they ask &quot;Why, is my child so sick all the time&quot;???  This book is a wake up call for America to start paying attention to their child's needs, getting back to nature the way our bodies were meant to live in harmony with - it is their birthright",1
"A B/W Film Classic.Excellent story and performances from all the stars, perhaps the acting style is a little dated.A very god qulaity transfer to DVD except for one scene that is a little grainy.I will watch this film again and again",0

"Though at the end of the book Hemingway states that his book is in no way intended to be an all inclusive book on bullfighting, it is considered by many to be ""the"" best book ever written on the subject. A literary triumph for those interested and those opposed to bullfighting, filled with details of what goes on before, during, and after the fights both from the matadors' and spectators' point of views. If you've never been to a bullfight, this book will put you ring-side to the artistry that is bullfighting.  (It is easy to see why this book is so well esteemed, Hemmingway's writing is an art all its own and this book is his fiercest ever.)Al fin del libro Hemingway dice que no lo debemos considerar el libro todo inclusivo de tauromaquia o corrida de toros, muchos lo consideran el libro definito en el tema. Un triunfo literario paro los interesados y los opuestos a las corridas, lleno de detalles de lo que susede antes, durante, y despues de las corridas en los ojos del matador y los espectadores. Si nunca ha ido a una corrida, este libro lo pondria pormedio del matador y el toro en el arte de la tauromaquia.  (Es facil ver porque este libro es tan bien estimado, el estilo de Hemmingway es un arte enteramente suyo y este libro es su mas feroz.)",1
"Pretty much every thing in the Pavement cannon is worth owning. I remember this album came out and all of my friend's including myself felt like it was a huge disappointment. Well I remember a few weeks later wondering if it was such a disappointment then how come I'm listening to it all the time? I can't recall ever having an album creep up on me and blowing me away like this one did. It turns out all of my friends were on the same page because we spent the entire summer of '94 playing this one. This album is sort of a fractured, eclectic split of pop, avante garde, and rock with tongue in cheek humor.  The songs scream, twist, laugh, cry, and often self destruct. The guitar solo on Rattle By The Rush starts out sounding like Jimmy Page, and ends with the notes coming off in demolished pieces. It's the classic Pavement twist- the catchy pop song with something off putting or silly, but still the juxtaposition comes off brilliantly. I've never heard of a band take so many wild chances and land on their feet as well. The disappointment that really happened the time this album came out was the lack of interest this band got on that joke of a tour Lollapalooza put on by that Schmuck Perry Ferrel",0
"Yet another success from the Klavier Wind recording project! As a member of a university wind ensemble, I greatly appreciate Klavier's dedication to recording new music for wind ensemble, a previously neglected medium. The selection of pieces on this recording is good and Corporon's interpretations are excellent. I have never heard such a flawless performance of &quot;Lincolnshire Posy&quot; which is quite difficult standard band literature. I was amazed by the &quot;Concerto for Solo Percussionist.&quot; The composer, William Childs melds classical and jazz styling in a very effective way and the solo work is jaw-dropping. And, of course everyone will love &quot;Cartoon&quot; by Paul Hart. This piece brought me back to the classic cartoons of my childhood. This CD is definitely a must-have for anyone interested in wind band music",0
"This is a great album.  Anyone who likes Christian rock music with great lyrics needs to pick up this cd.  I bought this cd when it first came out.  ""Faith like that"" is about a true story Vince tells about being on an Indian reservation and a man being raised from the dead.  The rest of teh songs including the hiden song after track 11 is good.  Nice worship song. Some of teh songs are a bit slow. Overall, a great album to have as part of your collection",0
"I bought this book for my parents and myself shortly after I came out, and I think that it was the best purchase I've made in terms of books regarding gay youth. I've lent it to several of my friends as well, when they've need help in their own coming-out process. It's just enormously comprehensive, and it's extremely interesting and uplifting too. Every gay youth should own this book",1
"What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said? It's violent? Yes. Is there a whole lot of cussing? Oh yeah. But is the violence and language really that gratuitous? Well the language is pretty much how people talk, like when the characters are just talking a f-word might slip occasionally but isn't that how normal conversations are? The language gets pretty rough but think of what the characters are going through. I'd be cussing just as much if someone just kidnapped me or just shot a roomful of people. And about the violence being gratuitous? Hell do you know what it looks like when someones head is blown off? Well let me tell you it's much worse in real life than in the book. So yeah it's a violent book but that justs shows how sick some of the characters are. The main characters resort to violence but never cold blooded murder. But beyond the gore and language there lies one of my favorite stories ever. The first story in this book about Jesse's family is my favorite story in the whole series. But the series as a whole is the reason I read graphic novels again. Best book ever, go pick it up",1

"I tried the trick of resizing, but honestly, the image quality is still abyssmal. The images are so low-resolution that only the vaguest of detail comes out. Please, if you're thinking of buying this for someone for Christmas this year, choose something else. It might be okay for someone with low standards or poor eyesight, but for anyone who can see well and knows what a good digital image looks like, this will be a huge disappointment.The good news is that in a few years these digital keychains will have advanced and will offer much better performance - that's almost guaranteed. So put this one on the ""must buy for mom"" list for the 2008 Christmas season.I very seldom write a review, and only wrote this one to keep people from making the same mistake I did",0
The product was received in a timely manner and was as expected,0
"I've been looking for this book for 15 years and hopefully just found it. I assume it was originally intended as a children's story, but the story is so subtle, and the characters so captivating, that I have no hesitation in recommending it to a general audience. Christian, a missionary's son, and his friend Big Tiger skip school to fly their kites near one of Peking's main gates. Since there isn't enough wind to do the kites justice they accept a ride from a trainful of soldiers. Unfortunately there is a problem getting off... and before they know it, Big Tiger and Christian find themselves trekking through 1930s (?) Mongolia, encountering nomads, lamas, bandits, princes, and scoundrels, digging for buried treasure, picking up Mongolian customs, and learning the wonderful comfort that comes with the phrase ""It can't be helped"". If you've got a copy keep [a] good hold of it, is my advice",1
"This book offered very little in the way of useful information.  To make matters worse, the cartoons that nearly filled every page of the book had almost nothing to do with recovery from the pain of addiction.  Perhaps, this book would be useful for someone with a very limited vocabulary, along with even less interest in overcoming an addiction. ",1
"The Winslow Boy is one of the best films I have seen in a long time.  It does not have the trappings of a typical Hollywood blockbuster; in fact, it lacks a bit of drama, but the intelligence and wit of the film ensures that it stays with you for a long time after the film ends.  The main plot of the story, the motives behind a family's commitment to proving the youngest son's innocence, may not sound very interesting at first, but the actors' performances and intelligent script turn it into a compelling story that draws the viewer deeply into the lives of the characters.  Overall, it's a quiet and restrained film, but one that gets under your skin without you even noticing it.  Some people may find it too slow and boring, but if you're willing to think and to watch some strong performances with excellent dialogue, I strongly recommend this film. Another bonus is the chemistry between Rebecca Pidgeon and Jeremy Northam.  There is no physical contact between their characters at all in the film, but their subtle sexual chemistry leaves you thinking ""What it they........?",0
"My first experience with Rent was the movie. I love the movie soundtrack, but it doesn't include many awesome songs, such as the Tune Ups, the Voice Mails and Christmas Bells (one of my personal favorites). I admit that I wasn't too keen on Daphne Rubin-Vega's voice to begin with, and I definitely had preferred Tracie Thoms to Fredi Walker. However, Daphne has grown on me, and I think Fredi is just amazing now. The Rent OBCR is nothing short of amazing, and the entire story of Rent basically unfolds in every song, so I'd say it's a terrific buy.",0

It has many songs that may not seem as good assome of their later work like Gentlemenor Black Love but if you like the Whigs buy this album because it also has songsthat sound like they came from later realeses.If you liked Gentlemen, buy this. If you neverheard of the Whigs, buy Gentlemen, then this",0
"During my careful read of this extraordinarily meaningful and important book written by respected author Nahid Rachlin, a deep forboding feeling of gloom and heavy weights continued to cover my spirit. So powerful is the tale of the two Iranian sisters Rachlin writes about: one who is able to essentially flee Iran to America to persue the freedom of her artistic desires, while the other sister is tragically confined to a similiar fate of many oppressed women post-Shah: pre-determined marriage, mental and physical abuse by an arrogant husband suitor, divorce, seperation from children, and the downward spiral of loss of self dignity and hope for a better tomorrow.The differences in American and Iranian society is clear: one is filled with freedom of choice while the other is filled with pre-determined choice which belittles the wonderment of women. While reading through the pages, I felt a sense of anger that such behaviour still exists in this world . . . behavior that belittles and reduces the power and sacredness of women.  This is not knew, particularly in the Middle East, but through Rachlin's articulate writing, I felt as if I was witnessing first hand the horrible oppression that to many women must face in the backward and zealot-like time bomb that is waiting to happen: Iran.As the political activities that are now heating up even moreso these days due to Iran's decision not to stop its nuclear program, the subliminal message in 'Persian Girls: A Memoir' should not be lost with respect to insight of the leaders who allow for human suffering at the simpliest level to occur.  Nahid Rachlin has written a very courageous and educational book, one well worth reading",1
A must read for all dog owners.  Loved it,1
"Impressive life events from two heros from the two fronts, Afghanistan and Iraq, during the war against terrorism.  This book was extremely difficult to put down.

"Everyone knows why we avoid the stuff we *don't* really want to do. But why do we avoid stuff we really *do* want to do?  There are no easy answers to questions like this, but what an eye-opening experience it is to start to understand some of the tricks the brain plays on itself.  This is an incredibly unique, honest book and God bless Dr. Flaherty - both for her ability to explain neurobiology to the uninitiated and, still more, for her willingness to bear her soul a bit. Buyer beware:  This is not a self-help book. It's an intimate conversation with a remarkable person. It won't change your life; but it might alter some of the ways you look at life.",1
"This album is phenomenal.  There are so many good reviews on this album and I don't think that I could write a better review than what has already been done but I just wanted to add one small thing.  This album is by far my favorite album to make love to. You should try it sometime.  Throw the album on repeat and your all set.  I also like to play it along with the album ""Dummy"" by Portishead and sometimes even a little Keith Jarett solo improv. They all make for a good night!!! This album is essential... Enjoy!!",0

"Each time I reread ""How I Grew"" I enjoy it more.  Mary McCarthy paints a picture of herself coming of age intellectually , alongside engaging and often hilarious descriptions of the people she meets in these formative years between age 13 and 21, the town she grows up in (Seattle), and her early experiences at Vassar.  What I love most is her chronicle of the most important and influential books and teachers in her life at this time, and how they shaped and sharpened her already apparent keen intelligence.  Witty, self-deprecating, acid-tongued, insightful, and admittedly selective in her memories, in this book Mary McCarthy gives us some clues as to how a young girl with a formidable intellect grew into one of America's literary giants",1
"This book should really be called ""martial arts for anyone who is not a super-fast, athletic, coordinated twenty-something male.""

I hope that Howard Bahr will be remembered for many generations to come. His exemplary work deserves that. This is the story of one 24 hour period in the battle of Franklin during the Civil War.

"I hate Chicken Soup for the Soul books.  I'm not interested in reading a book that makes you feel warm and musy for three seconds and then allows you to live your life the same way thereafter.  So normally, I won't read an &quot;inspirational&quot; book.  But this book was amazing!  First of all, it didn't just talk about who we would expect, like Moses or Krayzelburg.  This just went into detail about one swim club, and shared the stories of the top swimmers from there, even though they weren't all gold medalists.  Further, you got to see all sides of their story.  How they got into swimming, what the press thought of them, how they interacted with each other, how they did at other meets.  The whole book is so interesting, and you will laugh and you will cry.  Most importantly you will stay up until 4AM all week until you finish it because this is not a book you can easily put down",1
"New cookbook collectors will find this an invaluable reference tool for  evaluating their collection. Although missing the historical information  found in other reference books on the subject, the sheer number of  cookbooks listed makes it well worth the investment.  While my copy showed  1999 values on the cover, I found little difference in the few listings  checked against a 1993 revision of the same book. Overall, Dickinson's  values tend to be lower than other price guides, but this book is still a  very useful reference.  Despite any shortcomings, this book receives an  enthusiastic 5 stars just for being the absolute SIMPLEST reference book on  the subject I have found.  All titles are listed alphabetically - no  thumbing through different categories and trying to decode the author's  mindset for classifying a particular book",1
"This massive yellow tome contains lots of New Testament examples to illustrate every grammatical principal, and the index of scripture citations seems to list a citation for the majority of verses in the New Testament.

Robertson is quirky at times, but very rich.   See &quot;http://www.mindspring.com/~jwrobie/littleGreek.html&quot; for a fuller review of this grammar and other grammars",1

"Petronius' Satyricon is a unique satire on decadence and pleasure. Although the story takes place during Nero's reign, one begins to see that many of the scenes have relevance to today's society and its own debaucheries.The story follows the adventures of Aschyltus and Encolpio; two rhetoricians who are on an infinite quest for pleasure. Their frienship is challenged by their mutual attraction to Giton, a scoundrelous slave-boy who seems to have more wits and vices than all of the other characters. This triad of debauches is also joined by Emolpus, a trickster and pseudo-intellectual who's always scheming on how he can use his sophistry to hit the jack pot. The most memorable scene in the fragmentary work is Trimalchio's dinner; this chapter surprisingly brings the ancient past closer to modern times in its recital of the characters' casual conversations on money, opportunism, business, and, of course, pleasure.Although some readers have complained that Arrowsmith's translation isn't faithful to some of the Latin terms, the truth is (as is the case with any other foreign works) that some of the words don't have a counterpart in the English language (or any other modern language.) It is therefore the duty of the translator to use his poetic licence in conjuring the best phrase or sentence that can convey the theme or jist of the statement in question. I personally found this translation the most faithful in trying to convey the type of low-brow humor and puns that Petronius seems to have intended in his work. I strongly recommend this translation above other for that reason.",1
This book is an excellent tool to use. The projects: Build your own castle &amp; catapult was LOVED by my 9 &amp; 7 yr olds. The information was in a way that kids could read &amp; understand it all. Very useful for all,1
"...but their best. Down is an amazing band. NOLA is an awesome album, one of the 890's best records. But after a seven year hiatus, they release their best/strongest album. Featuring members of CoC, crowbar, Eyehategod, and, of course, Pantera, this is one of my favorite albums of all time. A favorite song here is ""Learn from This Mistake"", Phil's vocals are AMAZING. My favorite song on this album is the amazing ""Ghosts Along The Mississippi"". That song ALONE was the reason I bought this album. When I first got this album, I think I played that song on repeat for like 500000000000000000000000000 times! I just love that song! Another great song in ""Seed"". My second favorite song on the album is the epic ""Landing on the Mountains of Meggido"", which also has guest vocals from Opal Anselmo, Phil's wife (if i'm not mistaken). All the song's here kick ass, but the above mentioned songs are my definitve favorites. If you like metal, sludge metal, or just good music in general, this album is for you!Ratings:1.

"Legendary cult director Jess Franco has made a staggering amount of films in his career, and regardless of how non-existent the budget or incoherent the narrative is, nearly all of his pre-1980 work is at the very least interesting, and in many cases, fascinating. Jess Franco always provides us with sensuous eye candy and a great soundtrack, but in the case of ""Venus in Furs"", he goes far beyond that and creates a film that is more than just a great exploitation film - it's a great film period.Along with his two other masterworks, ""Vampyros Lesbos"", and ""She Killed in Ecstacy"", this is one of the few Franco films that has not only a strong story idea to start with, but a solid and well paced narrative to carry it along. The film benefits enormously by a great cast, anchored by leading man James Darren, who turns in a low-keyed, solid performance that is reminiscent of something you might see in a Hitchcock or early Brian Depalma film. Maria Rohm is as sensuous and captivating as ever, and both the lucious Barbara Lee and the sultry Barbara McNair round out what might be one of the best trio of ""Franco women"" ever cast together in one of his films. Also on hand is Franco/Euro-horror regular Klaus Kinski. He is solid as usual.It goes without saying that the movie looks great (given the age of the film, the transfer is superb), and is loaded with erotic imagery, but Franco outdoes himself here. The score by Manford Mann and Mike Hugg is outstanding and goes a long way toward creating the film's hypnotic atmosphere. This is a movie that Franco buffs and fans of Euro exploitation will simply love. Even non-Franco film buffs who enjoyed the likes of ""Jacobs Ladder"", and Mary Lambert's ""Siesta"", also might want to check it out",0
"I found this book to be very informative, and just an exciting book to read.  It gets to the heart of the Gospel Message",1
"In Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview J.P. Moreland and William Lane Craig offer a comprehensive introduction to the study of philosophy from a Christian perspective. In their broad overview they seek to introduce readers to the principal divisions of philosophy, including: ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, the philosophy of science, and the philosophy of religion. They write with their characteristic clarity and insightfulness. Their arguments are clearly outlined, and they present competing theories with fairness and accuracy.A graduate of Dallas Theological Seminary, Dr. J. P. Moreland is currently the Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology, Biola University, in La Mirada, California and a fellow of the Discovery Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture. He has written, edited and contributed to over twenty books with publishers ranging from academic presses of Oxford University Press, Routledge, and Wadsworth to the more Evangelical presses of Zondervan and InterVarsity Press. Among Dr. Moreland's books are Christianity and the Nature of Science, Scaling The Secular City, Does God Exist? (with Kai Nielsen) and Philosophical Naturalism: A Critical Analysis. He has also published more than fifty articles in journals such as Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, American Philosophical Quarterly, MetaPhilosophy, Pacific Philosophical Quarterly, Southern Journal of Philosophy, Religious Studies and Faith and Philosophy.A graduate of Trinity Evangelical Divinity Schools with M.A. degrees in Church History and the Philosophy of Religion, Dr. William Lane Craig earned his advanced degrees at University of Birmingham and the University of Munich.  Dr. Craig is the Research Professor of Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology, Biola University, in La Mirada, California. He has written or co-written more than twenty books, including: The Kalam Cosmological Argument, Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom, Theism, Atheism and Big Bang Cosmology and God, Time and Eternity. He has published articles in philosophical and theological journals such as The Journal of Philosophy, American Philosophical Quarterly, Philosophical Studies, Philosophy, British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, Modern Theology and Religious Studies. Dr. Craig is also a fellow of the Discovery Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture.This text is geared toward the new student of philosophy or Christianity who has a limited background in the issues at hand. For a very reasonable price, this is a good source of information best suited for graduate students or lay readers with rhetorical sophistication. Some of the articles can be quite advanced, employing a daunting vocabulary, but while this might make for a challenging read, it will only aid students in expanding their knowledge. Moreland and Craig's writing is concise, yet very thorough. The work is extremely well organized and chapters flow perfectly as each section compliments the next. Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview is one of the best introductory texts on philosophy written in quite a while. The textbook is comprised of six sections; the introduction discusses philosophy and the basics of argumentation and logic. The next segment, Epistemology, covers rationality, the problem of skepticism and rival theories of truth. Issues such as mind-body dualism, as well as human freewill vs. divine predestination, are addressed in the third chapter, Metaphysics. Philosophy of Science is the fourth chapter and has a nice summary of the scientific method as well as the integration of science and religion. Part five, Ethics, deals with the basic questions of morality, virtues and ethics and contains a comparison of relativism with absolutism. Philosophy of Religion and Philosophical Theology is the last section covering arguments for the existence of God and the possibility of miracles.This important new book is a guide intended for use as a textbook in courses on philosophy of religion. It aims to bring to the student the very best of explanations and arguments on important topics in the field. This text is a great reference tool emphasizing the Christian perspective; it offers some first rate introductions, explanations and provides the reader a list of suggested titles for further study. The only downfall, if you could call it that, is the fact that this text written from a decidedly Christian point of view. This should come as no surprise give both Dr. Moreland and Dr. Craig are known as contemporary Christian apologists. Someone who is looking for a text that is a collection of viewpoints or all inclusive in its approach may be disappointed with the authors' presentation. Yet in spite of its slant, it would make an outstanding primary text for an upper division undergraduate or graduate course in philosophy of religion. Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview would be a valuable addition to the library of anyone who is interested in the subject of philosophy or Christianity.",1

"In the story, The Ghost in the Tokaido Inn. The character Seiekei changes a lot for something he wants. Seikei first goes on a trip with his father and they stay in a hotel called the Tokaido Inn. Something or someone steels a priceless jewel from Lord Hunsu. A judge comes and looks at the evidence they suspect that a girl stole it because they found a fake jewel in the girl's room that looked just like the real jewel. Then Seiekei tells the judge that he saw someone else steal the jewel. Judge Ooka and Seiekei go on a trip to find the real jewel thief. Judge Ooka and Seiekei go out and trace all the missing clues and figure out that the thief was a ghost. Seiekei decides to stay with Judge Ooka and not his father because that's the only way Seiekei can become a Samaria. Seiekei father decides to let him go with Judge Ooka because it would be better and his father doesn't make that much money. That is how Seikei changes.",1
"I've always enjoyed Yanni and this album is no exception, but while reading some of the customer recommendations posted on this site I discovered a group by the name of Mehdi (pronounced meddie). After an online search I found their site (SoothingMusic - Com) and listened to the samples...I was instantly blown away by the quality of this music and so I gave it a try and now that I have listened to these CDs several times I really must say that although I'm still a Yanni fan, I  find Mehdi to be a wonderful addition to this CD. I have them both in my multi-disc CD player and love the way they compliment each other. I highly recommend that you give this artist a try or atleast just go listen to the samples, I have a feeling you'll be glad you did",0
"A master of the nylon-string guitar, Oscar Lopez can match the brilliance of metal-strung instruments any day of the week.  His flamenco-style numbers are fiery and stirring, while his slower compositions are beautifully mellow.  From stirring to calming, soulful to fun, ""Heat"" is a nicely varied album that finds a balance between extremes.  Though steeped in the traditional, minor harmonic structures of traditional flamenco, Lopez's playfully intricate strumming gives this music a predominantly uplifting feel.  Joining him are Brent Gubbels on electric and acoustic bass, and Gustavo Estrada on percussion.  If you like this CD, you may also enjoy the work of Robby Longley and Behzad.  Oscar Lopez is also featured on Narada compilations such as ""Obsession"" and ""Gypsy Fire.""",0

"Although the way it's told will put off contemporary readers (there's little or no characterization or internal thought processes of characters), Njal's Saga tells a story that seems relevant to our own time, about the cycle of violence & the difficulty of restoring peace when you have once resorted to violence. A fascinating view of a society with too few structures to control violence -- like the international scene today",1
I can say that Slick Rick is one of my favorite rappers and can say I have seen him in concert back in the late 80's. I still think that Children's Story is a classic and is a song that everyone enjoys listening to. I feel bad for Slick as of late with his trouble with Immigration and hope he can stay here in the States and work on a new album to drop this year in 2007 as it is long over due. Slick Rick keep doing your thing and we are waiting for a new album.,0
"This book is a great starter for Miss Marple-readers. Though many will disagree and say that MURDER OF THE VICARAGE is (considering it was published as the first Miss Marple-book), THE BODY IN THE LIBRARY introduces an interesting plot, multiple settings, and suspects with multiple motives. It introduces the usual blueprint that surrounds Miss Marple mysteries. There is a detective or inspector who goes around asking initial questions and such. There is a chief who gives updates on a daily basis. Usually, they all have something to do with(or know about)Miss Marple. Miss Marple's great friend Mrs. Bantry and her husband Colonel Bantry wake up to a shocking sight: a blonde girl murdered brutally at Gossington Hall. The plot thickens, doesn't it always! Expect this book to give twists and turns at every corner and make you want to read every single one. This was in fact my first Miss Marple book, so I might be kind of bias. Buy this book with THE MIRROR CRACK'D {{sometimes referred to as THE MIRROR CRACK'D...FROM SIDE TO SIDE}} as Mrs. Bantry is introduced once again in this book and there's a new murder. Miss Marple is also involved in this one",1

"I love rock poster art and it's various artists past (Griffin, Mouse) to present. (Kozik, Coop, Stephens)And this book contains some of the past history of the rock poster but intorduces the start of the modern poster art explosion led by Frank Kozik in the 80's and  90's and explores the various artists and styles from the past, present and future of poster art. And also, it is a beautiful coffee table book (I bought mine on Amazon and love it) that your friends and foes will love and admire and want to buy from you.  I love to quote that old BET commerical ""No my Brotha you got to get your own"".",1
"I am a diehard Indigo Girls fan.  I also enjoy instrumental guitar, etc.  I thought I would enjoy this CD.  Let's just say that this CD is to the Indigo Girls as John Tesh is to Metallica.  These are ""elevator music"" versions of Indigo Girls songs and somehow, the musicians on this CD have managed to bleed every bit of complexity and feeling from the music of the Indigo Girls.  This was a HORRIBLE CD!  I thought I might put it in a yard sale, but decided some other poor true fan would be lured in as I was, so I decided to humanely destroy it by driving over it.  If you love the passion of the Indigo Girls and their complex melodies as I do, stay FAR AWAY from this CD",0
"Taking Albert Pike as my cue, Morals and Dogma is far more candid about the origin of the Craft than this book.First of all, searching for the origin of Freemasonry (or at least its preservation) amongst the Knights Templar is preposterous.  There is no evidence the Knights Templar possessed, preserved or advocated any gnostic gospels or secret teachings of Jesus.  This is an anachronism since the gnostic gospels have only gained notoriety in our time.The Knights Templar were a bunch of mercenaries who had purely mercenary interest when they safely guarded pilgrimages to the Holy Land.  They were good investers and eventually became creditors.  With this money they purchased land in France.  The French King coveted this wealth and property and so spread the libel about the Templars being heretics in order to use the Pope to get rid of them so that the French King could confiscate the Templar's property.  The Pope at the time even regretted that he tried them for heresy.The Templar origin only operates as misdirection.  I don't know if this is deliberate, although it is hardly unlikely that it isn't deliberate.  Afterall, masonic texts clearly spell out the Kabbalistic origin of freemasonry.  Even the legend of Hiram Abif and Solomon's temple are ostensibly Juwish and should not be disregarded and eclipsed by this Knights Templar nonsense.  Freemasonry is a gnostic religion.  Specifically, its gnosticism borrows heavily from juwish sources, such as the Kabbala.  The pythagorean theorem, and other nonjuwish notions are merely trappings that have been added on to the Kabbalistic core of this gnostic cult.With regard to Egyptian mysticism, I find it unlikely that it was transmitted to the Freemasons over the centuries since it was only recently that Egyptian hieroglyphics were deciphered by Champollion (1790-1832).  The only record we have of Jesus' life is the four Gospels (There are of course Roman and Greek and Jewish sources such as Tacitus, Lucan, Josephus and the Talmud; but, I'm referring to ""eye witness accounts"").  Outside of the record His disciples left us, there is no other sources of what Jesus said or did.  Therefore, to presuppose as Christopher Knight does that he has superior historical materials than the writings of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, and the rest of the New Testament, is the epitome of nonsense.  Don't waste time with this book.  It leads you on rabbit trails.  It has countless more errors than this which I need not go into.",1
"If you are a religious scholar who is interested in the ancient origins of prayers offered for the dead, no academic research ever published will provide the abundance of insights that can be found on the pages of Wieseltier's ""Kaddish.""My book is now dog-eared, highlighted and underlined; and I have a lengthy collection of quotes that I carry with me and continue to review for new meaning. The trick is to read it slowly and often. ""Paper is stronger than stone.  The Jews knew this.""             ",1
This book gives a good look into the misconceptions that many people have about the Civil Rights movement.  Sowell keeps his examples simple and easy to follow.

I am currently placing an order for 3 more, because they hold so much food and they keep the serving table from becoming to crowded. Love them !!!",0
"This recording is unique in John Coltrane's impressive body of work.  An empassioned recording with unusual exotic brass arrangments.  His working group of himself, McCoy Tyner, Elvin Jones and Reggie Workman are in top form.  Elvin Jones and Reggie Workman are both vital to the pulse of this recording.   Contained on this extended release of the original recording are alternate versions of both his marvelous ""Greensleeves"" but two alternate takes of ""Africa"".  The brass lends so much ambience to this recording.  I was enthralled and captivated by the sophistication, passion and pulse of this recording.   Mr. Coltrane plays his heart out here.  The arrangments are so complimentary here that you cannot ever imagine these songs without them no matter how brilliant the soloists.   Reggie Workman's bass just resonates. His accompaniment is brilliant. Elvin Jones is perfect counterpoint for him.   There is so much tension and release here, a fine sense of pacing.  This is modern jazz at it's most vital.  This is my favorite John Coltrane recording.  The only complaint I have is not musical.  It is the omission of the wonderful sculpture that graced the cover of the original vinyl release.    This one is a must for any serious jazz collector.   It shows one of the masters at the height of his power.  ""Greensleeves"" in it's complete re-invention and redefinition is worth the price of this recording",0
"opposites such as sobriety/addiction, good/evil, etc.  And what a deeply touching book Susan Cheever has written here, so loving and affectionate, so eloquent -- the very reasons to be suspect by our sober fellow citizens still awaiting the untarnished messiah who will deliver us from this vale of tears!  Of course Bill Wilson was no saint!  And JFK and MLK were promiscuous, the list goes on and on.  Lincoln was a depressive, now he was even gay!I appreciate so much about the book; simply as a wonderfully detailed history of places, of ideas, of spiritual searching.  Ms. Cheever covers a lot of territory!  And I do think she is fair -- fair to the unwillingly famous man, fair to his loved ones, fair to fellow AA members.Read this book and expand your heart",1
"This was the compilation which launched a renewed interest in the great MGM musicals.  Admittedly, the great days of the movie musical had long ended in 1974, when this tribute first appeared.  However, some of us had never seen the original films and it was wonderful to see and hear tantalizing excerpts from MGM's vast library.Jack Haley, Jr. produced and edited ""That's Entertainment"" and utilized a number of major stars who had worked at MGM.  The studio was about to undergo a major change with the demolition of its backlot and the eventual sale of numerous costumes and props.  MGM was sadly declining in 1974.  This film at least reminded us of how much MGM had contributed to the American cinema.The overture, which was played at the original showing and is included on the video, was actually arranged and conducted by Henry Mancini, who began his career scoring horror films at Universal before going to to write sophisticated, memorable scores at various studios.Frank Sinatra begins the tribute with four versions of ""Singing in the Rain,"" first the rather quaint and primitive 1929 version of Cliff Edwards in ""Hollywood Review,"" followed by renditions by Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, and finally Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds.  He is then seen walking out of MGM's Thalberg Building, the rather imposing executive offices where so many stars were introduced to studio boss Louis B. Mayer.Mayer created the Freed Unit, which specialized in musicals and operettas, and he gave producer Arthur Freed remarkable freedom to make family-suitable movies, utilizing virtually every star on the lot except Greta Garbo, John Gilbert, and Lon Chaney.  At the end of her career Garbo actually did dance in an MGM musical, while Chaney died prematurely after making his talkie debut in a remake of ""The Unholy Three.""Most of the first musicals weren't very good, as is acknowledged in this compilation.  The scenes from some of the early musicals demonstrate the limited technical capabilities and perhaps MGM's own uncertainty on how to best produce musicals.  In time, as sound recording and cinemaphotography improved, MGM was able to utilize real singers and dancers, after brief attempts to use Joan Crawford, Robert Montgomery, and James Stewart in musicals.  Yet, as Elizabeth Taylor recalls, even she was put in a musical and asked to sing, despite a rather limited singing voice.  These examples are perhaps just curiosity pieces.The real highlights are the many, many wonderful excerpts from the great musicals with the likes of Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Eleanor Powell, Ginger Rogers, Judy Garland, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Durante, etc.  These examples led to a revival in the full films through showings on various television stations and eventually on Turner Classic Movies, as well as periodic showings in actual movie theaters.Debbie Reynolds introduces a memorable excerpt from the black and white film of MGM's 25th anniversary luncheon, in which most of the contract players were assembled in a huge soundstage.  This 1949 film gives a good idea of the famous statement that MGM had ""more stars than there are in the heavens.""Little actual restoration of the films was done in 1974, so some of the examples have faded or uneven color and the sound quality varies considerably.  Nevertheless, this film presents a wonderful overview of the best of MGM's great movies and it was so successful that it paved the way for two more ""That's Entertainment"" films, which are also available on DVD",0

"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures Huckleberry Finn as great book to read. It's way better than the movie, like most books are. Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry do things that would give your life such a rush. The adventures they go through and the trouble they get into is just great. Children these days can't do some of the stuff they do without being gounded for life or send to a military camp, but on thing they can do is use there imagination like Tom and Huck do in this book. This is a really good book to read and it feels like your part of the book, which is a cool feeling. This is one of my all time favorite books. I read it once already but  I just want to open it and start reading it again. Mark Twain, AKA Samuel Clemens, had a taste for adventure now it's your to taste it. There are many moods to go thrugh in this book happy, sad, angry and etc. Just got to read it. There is excitement around ever corner.Uproariously funny, Tom and Huck even run away awhile, to show you how hard it is to live on your own if your a kid to see how hard it is to support yourself on you own. There is even a murder in this story and it's a cool court case to. But there more not like I'm going to tell you, Oh Ok you pulled my leg hard enough. They also fine buried tresure enough said. I hope you read this book. ENJO",1
"Total Knee Replacement & Rehabilitation: The Knee Owner's Manual is the collaborative effort of orthopedic surgeon Daniel J. Brugioni and physical therapist Jeff Falkel. Ideal for the non-specialist general reader with questions or concerns regarding knee arthroplasty (total-knee-replacement surgery), this highly recommended instructional reference work provides a complete and detailed description of the full scope of the surgery, including postoperative treatment and the hospital experience. Of special note is the section of preoperative considerations for the reader to consider in determining if (and when) knee arthoplasty is the proper procedure for them. Additionally, more than 145 exercises suitable for people of all ages are provided and arranged from Week 1 to Week 52, enhanced with some 200 photographs and illustrative drawings. There is even a special Q&A section at the end of each chapter to insure that the information within that chapter has been properly assimilated and understood. If you or a loved one are considering knee surgery due to arthritis or injuries, then you need to give a close and careful reading to Total Knee Replacement & Rehabilitation!",1
"The early seventies saw a revolution in cosmology; for the first time, modern mathematical methods were applied to the discipline, with intriguing results.  This book was (along with Penrose's articles) the seminal work in global general relativity.  Often overlooked is that the first half of  Hawking &amp; Ellis is devoted to traditional GR via the tensor calculus,  and the q-form conception.  However, trying to learn GR with this volume is  not recommended (instead, cf. D'Inverno).  The meat-and-potatoes of the  book is the discussion of gravitational collapse, and the singularity  theorems.  They provide us with intuitively good reasons for believing in  some very strange phenomenon.  If you're interested in the frontiers of  modern science, and have the appropriate mathematical background, this book  cannot be recommended too highly.  The little yellow book stands supreme in  the hierarchy of works of modern physics",1

"In this clear, concise, and well-written book, Alland provides his readers with a measured, thoughtful and compelling critique of historical and contemporary theories about the supposed genetic basis for group (i.e., racial) differences in social achievement and intelligence.  Alland begins by providing the reader with a refreshingly accessible treatment of evolutionary theory, Mendelian genetics, and their relevance to current discussions about the social construction of race. As a professor of cultural anthropology who also has substantive training in physical anthropology, Alland is able to problematize taken-for-granted assumptions that reify and naturalize racial categories with recourse to faulty understandings of natural selection, heritability, and speciation. His convincing explanation of race as ""a flawed concept"" helps to ground his critique of its usage in biased scientific and pseudo-scientific studies (by the likes of Carlton Coon, Arthur Jensen, Cyril Burt, Leonard Jeffries, J. P. Rushton and others) that purport to 'prove' (i) that there are statistically significant differences in intelligence between racial groups (for Burt, the IQ groupings were class-based) and (ii) that those differences are due to genetic (and not environmental) factors. With a careful reading of these highly publicized studies and their epistemological presuppositions, political biases and methodological flaws, Alland undeniably shows that these attempts at operationalizing, geneticizing and racializing intelligence say more about the political interests of these scientists than anything else. What makes this book so useful (I have advised some of my colleagues to think about including it in their courses on the anthropology of race) is that Alland is able to show the linkages between and among seemingly disparate spheres: afrocentricism, social constructionism, genetics, evolutionary psychology, physical anthropology, linguistic ideology, archeology and fossil-naming, biological determinism, culture of poverty arguments, sociobiology, and even census-categorization. Alland illustrates  just how all of these fields/spheres have a role to play in the international drama that is irrational racial thinking.  Moreover, Alland takes these scientists and their theories seriously enough to carefully delineate why environmental explanations still offer the most compelling ways to understand group differences in social performance",1

"Davenport and Harris have followed up their influential HBR article with a well thought out, clearly communicated and detailed analysis of how companies will really compete in the future -- by using what they know to take the right actions throughout their companies.  Davenport and Harris call these types of companies analytical competitors and they look at the world differently and produce significantly different results.Analytics is becoming a requirement in every industry as customers have choice and companies face increased competition.  They define analytics as ""the extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and predictive models and fact based management to drive decision and actions"" This may sound like an academic book.  But Davenport and Harris go well beyond hyping a new idea to provide dozens of practical examples from companies we all know.  This blend of explaining a new way of competition using practical examples from proven companies makes this book a must read for business people.The book breaks down into chapters that discuss each aspect of becoming an analytical competitor. Chpt 1: The Nature of Analytical Competition describes how companies can consistently beat the market by knowing more and doing more with what they know.  This chapter ties analytics with competitive strategy in a way that goes well beyond traditional market-ese.Chpt 2: What makes an Analytic Competitor provides a detailed description and checklist of attributes that these leading companies share.  The interesting point is that the examples range across industries demonstrating that Chpt 3: Analytics and Business Performance looks at how this technique drives top and bottom line growth.  This chapter demonstrates that analytics is more than just a good idea it's a good idea that business professionals should get their heads around.Chpt 4: Competing on Analytics with Internal Processes connects information with the capabilities that form the basis for competitive advantage.  This chapter dispels the myth that analytics is purely a marketing tool for customer segmentation and messaging. Chpt 5: Competing on Analytics with External Processes focused on how companies use information for partnering and collaboration with suppliers.  This is particularly critical to companies as many outsource and create relatively `uninformed' partners.Chpt 6: A Road Map to Enhanced Analytic Capabilities connects these benefits with specific stages and actions required to become an analytic competitorChpt 7: Managing Analytical People proves that Davenport and Harris have investigated, thought through and are providing practical advice as they address key leadership and management issues that arise when information becomes an integral part of operations.Chpt 8: The Architecture of Business Intelligence clarifies a stumbling block for many who think of analytics as just something they can buy as part of their BI solution.  Its not and understanding the architecture and difference is something that separates those who buy tools and those who compete with their capabilities.Chpt 9: The future of Analytical Competition highlights future issues and how analytics will shape markets as people, devices and activities become smarter. There are few books that you want to read from start to finish and fewer that you recommend to peers.  This book is both.  So read this to get ahead of the competition and stay there. ",1

"Jun Liu has been a prominent researcher in MCMC since the mid 90's.  His research has contributed a great deal to the development of Gibbs sampler, sequential Monte Carlo, weighting/importance sampling, missing data, and MCMC related applications in Bioinformatics.

This book has a strong flavor in statistical physics, which I like very much.

"I was looking for a lightweight windbreaker, but with more substance than the typical nylon jacket, and this is it.  The shell is polyester/cotton with a Teflon coating and has that 'London Fog' feel and look to it, very elegant.  And it has a very nice cotton plaid lining inside that gives the jacket the feel of wearing a coat and not that thin nylon windbreaker feel.  Yet, it seems as light as a nylon windbreaker.  Should it rain, the water rolls right off due to the Teflon coating.  Under the front flaps up to the neck is a netting that allows the coat to breathe and keep things comfortable inside.  The neck area and the zipper flap keep out the wind and rain when it's too warm outside for a heavy coat.  And it's machine washable and dryer safe.  I like how it looks on me and the way it feels wearing it.  Here in the San Francisco Bay Area where it can be chilly in the morning, and anything from cool to warm or foggy and windy in the afternon, with this coat I'm ready for anything!",0
"While not a perfect book, this is one of the few books I know which I would call ""required reading"" for people in the environmental movement and ecology.  It's not a science book, which is one of my minor problems with it, but I titled this review comment with my opinion prior to taking the first of 2 classes (1974) by one of Nash's student colleagues and then Nash himself.  I, and a slew of my colleagues in 1970 really needed to have read this during the organization and preparation for what was then termed ""The First Environmental Teach-In"" now called ridiculously ""Earth Day.""I felt this way in 1974, because I could see that we had retrod ground done by Brower 2 decades earlier and Muir seven decades. And then I learned of names I had never heard before like G. Pinchot and the roles of people like John Wesley Powell independent of the Grand Canyon survey and Stephen Mather and the Natl. Park PR machine (not all bad).  This book is part of why students are supposed to take history classes.The 2nd ed (pub. 1973)., which I had and still have, covered events I lived and can confirmed happened.  That's toward the end of the book.  The beginning of the book are about pre-American precursors in Europe such as the Romantic movement and various humanist issues like painting and writing.  Some of these parts were were a little slow for me (I did read Rousseau), but it did put the Black Forest in perspective more than a type of cake.  And that helps with understanding forestry schools.Nash is good in showing the development of the conservation movement (incl. soil reclamation and forestry [and why hunters and fishers are conservationists]) to the shortcoming of conservation and the start of preservation (Muir, Mather), and the latter shortcomings of ""loving wilderness to death"" and the rise of environmentalism and ecological biology (Nash likes Leopold, I prefer Rachel Carson, we agree on reading Ed Abbey).Rod is good at tying together art, literature (here your transcendalists in American Literature come in), popular culture (recreation), religion (See his Rights of Nature book for more depth), and science (barely).  He has a good bibliography, one of the finest that I have seen if you want more depth and references, but the field is pretty vast and Nash's text is already thick so his survey is at best described as shallow (supplementary reading like Doug Strong's The Conservationists helps).Alaska in the 3rd ed. is important to the future. I have been given by Rod in the past ""seed"" copies, and I purchase ""Wilderness"" as gifts.  I stopped doing that until recently when I was surprised a bio prof friend was unaware.  I know he will enjoy reading ""Would you flood the Sistine Chapel to get closer to the ceiling?""I wish that Gaylord Nelson (then Sen., Wisc.) had had us read this book.  I think that we would have gone further on that day in 1970.  The book is just a shadow of the class experience, I leave lots of book detail out in this review/summary.",1

Otherwise, it is descriptive and excellent",1

"Just got the two sets that I ordered yesterday and am thrilled with them. The quality is fabulous .. better than anything I have seen in bed and bath  or department stores. The suede feel is very luxurious and substantial without being overly heavy. I got this camel set (as well as the paisley) and the color is very elegant and rich .. not too light or yellow looking. I bought this to layer with some other linens (such as a fabulous throw) to get a designer look on a budget. This camel set will do the trick no matter what color scheme you are using .. neutrals, cool or warm colors will all work with this so you can easily trade out other accessories with each season without spending a fortune to get a fresh look.(The paisley set is also very luxurious-looking  .. very rich, warm and deep colors that give a Ralph Lauren look to the set.)I highly recommend this set if you are looking for something new and versatile for your bedroom.",0

The story was all over the place and I'm still not too sure what kind of childhood Ms. Salinger had. There is a lot on the history of the Jewish people (which came across to me as ""filler"" to take up pages) if you're into history...I did come away feeling that she was a spoiled, over-educated rich kid who takes her precious highbrow education for granted.

"In spite of the fact that the title seems dated, this is a timeless classic of the dance musical genre.  Fresh off their incredible success in FYING DOWN TO RIO, in which they stole the show from the top billed Gene Raymond and Dolores Del Rio (the most gorgeous woman ever to grace the silver screen), Fred and Ginger dance their way into our hearts as well as into film history in this effervescent creation.All of it works beautifully, from the incredible sets and costumes to the snappy dialogue to the toe tapping songs.  But of course we have come for Rogers and Astaire's dancing and, oh boy, do they dance!Fred and Ginger meet, as they so often do in these films, under somewhat adverse circumstances, as the unhappily married Ginger, meeting her aunt at the pier, gets her hem caught in her aunt (Alice Brady)'s steamer trunk.  Fred is immediately smitten; her dress is the worse for his assistance; the die is cast.Ginger, meanwhile is under whelmed.  Fred knows it is like ""Looking for a Needle in a Haystack"" but he has got to find Ginger, so he roams all over London first on foot, and then in a cute little roadster.  He finds Ginger - driving a big Packard, in a wooded area that looks remarkably like Southern California - and they have a brief encounter that does not go all that well.  No matter, Fred's friend, the befuddled soliciter played by Edward Everett Horton says he will whisk Fred off to the seaside and off they go.  The reason for the visit is Ginger's divorce case, which in Britain was accomplished by having  a paid correspondent, here played in broadly comic pseudo-Italian by Eric Rhodes.At the seaside, Horton wastes no time ""Knocking Knees"" with itsy bitsy Betty Grable, proving the addage that some people should never wear shorts (Horton) and some should wear them as much as possible (Grable).The timing is flawless as Eric Blore as the wacky waiter discusses the merits of tea and crumpets with Horton and whimsy and whamsy with an equally dizzy Alice Brady.  All goes swimmingly for Fred finds Ginger; they end up singing and dancing to Cole Porter's ""Night and Day"" their romantic number that sets the mood for the second half of the film and sets the standard for all romatic dance numbers thereafter.  This is one of their duets in which the poetry of their dance style shows to tremedous effect.  Smoothly sophisticated and hold-your-breath lovely.  It rivals ""Cheek to Cheek"" in ""Top Hat"", ""never Gonna' Dance"" and the ""Waltz in Swing Time"" in the movie of that name, as well as ""Face the Music"" in ""Follow the Fleet"" for their trademark elegance and elan.By now, Ginger has now more or less succumbed to Fred's charms but all is complicated when Fred (who originated it in conversation with Horton) uses the secret phrase that Ginger expects to be used by the paid correspondent--""Fate is the fools name for chance!"" Which Rhodes, by the way has gotten impossibly wrong as ""I am fate to take foolish chances with!""Imagine Ginger's surprise!  Has she fallen for someone of such low social standing?  Before long they work out that pesky problem and about that time, from their balcony, they hear the strains of the ""latest thing over here"": ""The Continental"".  Thereafter ensues one of the longest dance numbers in any musical, and every one of the seventeen minutes is well worth it, as Ginger, Rhodes and (can you do that with your elbows?) Lillian Miles each offer their various interpretations of the lyrics, while beautifully black-and-white costumed dancers dance their legs off.  Sometimes the guys and gals are in all black or all white and sometimes a mixture thereof, they dance up and down stairs, on balconies and terraces and in the revolving doors and we are just awestruck.(By the way Frank Lloyd Wright used the triple pair of revolving doors in his soon to be built deco extravaganza Johnson Wax Buliding; if you want to see this Holywood set reinterprited by America's best architect, go to Racine and take the tour. You'll be glad you did).The number concludes with Ginger and Fred taking to the floor and trying out this new dance in which you sing and kiss while you're dancing. The moment the rest of the dancers get a load of them, they clear the floor pronto and let them have their moment in the spotlight.  Fred is suave as ever and Ginger is ravishing in her beaded gown which has exactly the right amount of swirl and cling to show off her fabulous legs.  Finally, just when you think you have seen it all, they do their interpritation of dances from around the world and end with a breathtakingly lush waltz as they float down a flight of stairs.  In the days before bedroom scenes, this kind of a moment was the height of romance, and guess what?  It still is.After that, it is fair to say that the film's climax is defiantly anti, but Fred and Ginger do give us one of their trademark up-and-over-the-furniture dances before the final curtain.Of course, friends this is an RKO Radio Picture.  And nothing could be better than that! ",0
"A one star rating for this toy is way to charitable. The car does nothing but jerk, and thats only when repeatedly hitting the button. Disney should be a shame of themselves for marketing this toy! Surely they had to have an idea about their product's poor performance. My advice is everyone should print off the reviews from Amazon and all like it. With this in hand, march into Disney stores and demand (1) their money back (2) an apology. The only thing less reliable than this was my 1991 GMC Jimmy",0

"James Stewart is the best business writer working today. After reading one of his books, whether Disneywar or Den of Theives, it's hard to read any other narrative journalism. His books are written in such a convincing and understandable way that the Enron exposes seem dry in comparison.

"I bought this for my nephew that was coming to visit from Germany. He is 13 months old and loved it (since it is labeled for 0-12 months). It was perfect for the plane ride (9 hour ride) since it is light weight can be ""skwished"" with out breaking it, and it doesn't make much noise (it only makes noise when the wood pieces slide on the ropes and hit each other). This is the kind of toy that can be bought for a much younger (3 months or so)child and it will grow with them. I would absolutely recommend this toy for car rides, plane trips or just playing around the house.",0

"I started Insulow in June 06.  I have been diagnosed as insulin resistant with polycystic ovarian syndrome.  Over the past year, my cortisol levels shot through the roof due to external stress and despite, a drastic change in diet, the addition of Relacore and vigorous workouts up to 6 days a week, I could not drop a pound.  Glucose was simply not going to my muscles! Also, when I ate too much refined sugar over a period of days, I would get terrible boils from the sugar building up in my blood.  After sticking to the Insulow regimen of 15 min. before meals, I am no longer fighting boils.  Now is August 1, 2006 and I have successfully shed 7 lbs so far and my stomach is visibly smaller.  I can go much longer periods between meals, sometimes up to 6 hours.  I also eat much smaller meals, much, much smaller meals!  I do take Insulow in addition to Relacore because I was diagnosed with high cortisol and the two give me so much energy that my entire lifestyle is reverting to the days when I was healthy.  I'm out clubbing 2-3 days a week and exercising in my living room the other days.  I feel wonderful. ",0

"This book is a valuable extrapolation of the adage ""By the yard is hard; by the inch it's a cinch.""  It uses the concept of Kaizen or continuous improvement via small steps to help people achieve goals.  Maurer's neurological explanations are consistent, though he does not back them up with references, with current neurological knowledge about how the brain adapts to circumstances and helps change behavior, i.e., by taking small Kaizen steps, a person bypasses the amygdala's fight-or-flight response, and allows the individual to gradually but surely progress towards their goals.  This book confirms what other self-help authors have advised - take that first step, however small, toward your goals, and take another one the next day, however small.  You will eventually gain momentum and achieve what you desire",1

"Diane has made clear and exciting what many others have reduced to meaningless ritual. Her descritions of the SSR attunement ceremonies, the meanings and uses of the many symbols, and the etiquettte and ethics of a  healing session are marvelously clear and easy to follow.

"From some of the reviews I looked at below you'd think that children didn't have a right to watch the things they enjoy. There are many films I viewed as a young boy that I would not want to watch today, however, they were good for there time. And children need to have their films too! So lighten up adults! This animation was made for, marketed and directed for children. My two young daughters loved this film. And that is all that matters to me. However, I liked it too. My children laughed through many parts of the film, and I right along with them. So you don't have to be a child to enjoy the film.  As for the reviewer below, ""Toy Story"" is great and a wonderful and delightful film. But so is this. If you have children [I have two young daughters] you might consider this film. It is immensely enjoyable with action, suspense, and comedy rolled into one. Just what the children need: A little bit of relaxing fun. The story centers around a family of super-heroes with both the Mom and Dad retired from the spy business to raise a family. But their young children also have super powers. I highly recommend the film [for children] and also for the other children [adults like me]. This is a delightful little treat of a film and does not need apologies or comparisons to other films. Enjoy it for the sake of entertainment. Recommended! ",0

"*no spoilers*The Oscar buzz is all over the new film ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and we were there to find out the hype. It is basically a dark fantasy tale--a la ""Never Ending Story""--where director Guillermo Del Toro combines two things; a fairy tale daydream of a preteen girl and the crude reality of the world she lived in. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is an interesting, creepy and dramatic film that shows us why many children want to escape their sad realities by creating new ones of their own.Story:""Pan's Labyrinth"" takes place in Northern Spain after the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1944. Things are not going well for the 12-year old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) whose father died. She has to move in along with her ill pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to a new home in the countryside--she brings her fairy tales books with her. Carmen is pregnant from her new husband, the brutal Capitan Vidal (Sergi López) who waits for them. He was sent to that remote area to destroy the remaining militia group who hides in the mountains and wants to take control of the village. The Capitan also wants Carmen to give birth where he is. The day of their trip, Ofelia discovers a hidden magical world. She encounters a goat-like faun who tells her that she is a princess, but in order to regain her kingdom, she must complete three tasks. She accepts and the adventure begins.Review:""Pan's labyrinth"" was written and directed by Guillermo Del Toro ('Blade II', 'Hellboy') who combined civil war, political instability and a fantastic fairy tale world. In her adventure, Ofelia is the princess, the one that matters and savior of her future brother and dying mother from the dangerous ""adult world"" they're stuck in. Is this a pipe dream? Unfortunately nobody sees this magical world but her. This situation keeps us guessing about what she is really seeing. Back in the real world, Del Toro doesn't waste any time of letting us know who the bad guys are. He show us extreme moments of how Capital Vidal--along with his soldiers--kills the ""enemies"" of Spain, which is very tough to look at. This creates realism and sensitivity for the audience who see the atrocities committed during the Spanish Civil War.The fairy tale world she sees is full of strange, creepy and symbolic oddities. We see creatures--some look extremely hideous in a cool way--that she has to face in order to make all her problems go away. We like the way the story jumps from fantasy to reality without compromising the rhythm of the movie. In other words, the editing is excellent and it doesn't drag, all these elements displayed with eye candy cinematography.The movie is well acted; especially Sergi López who is probably the best actor in this film. He gives us an excellent performance as the ruthless, mean and arrogant Capitan Vidal--we love to hate this character.The Verdict:Although the ending is unsatisfying and open to interpretation, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a respectable movie that tells the fantasy of a child who didn't want to grow up and wanted to be a fairy tale princess forever. All mixed with political themes and war. We recommend this film and we won't be surprised if this movie shows up at the Oscars. The movie is in Spanish with English subtitles and not recommended for small children.",0
"	We think The Godfather was a excellent book we enjoyed the way Mario Puzo describes every scene with numerous details. We also enjoyed how Mario Puzo describes all the characters. The book is full of crime, love, passion, action, and tragedy. We were also delighted by the way Mario Puzo jumps from one scene to another in each chapter. The Godfather is a book you never want to put down once you start reading the first page.",1
It is fiction of course. It can not be otherwise for what it contends may happen is IMPOSSIBLE! Many reviewers are upset. Upset perhaps but they should not be worried. The Church is protected by Christ's promise that it will not err. Any person of faith sees this book as FICTION. It is a poor attempt to disguise Greely's left wing theology as fiction. The message to those liberals who find &quot;hope&quot; for their cause in this book: IT AIN'T GOING TO HAPPEN. Recommended reading: &quot;Women Priests And Other Fantasies&quot; Greely and his followers are delusional,1
"I have consumed VC Andrews' books since her debut with Flowers In The Attic so many years ago.  That was a ""scandalous"" book to a seventh grader.  The Dollanganger saga was the first complete series I had.  I read My Sweet Audrina--yech--the Casteel series, and the Cutler series, but none really grabbed my interest like the Dollangangers had.  Enter Ruby Landry.I absolutely LOVE these books.  Next to my copy of The Stand and my Harry Potter books, these books sit in the place of honor.  I have bought and rebought these books I don't know HOW many times.  And I don't know why.Probably because it takes place in Louisiana, which, even now, after Katrina, is still a favorite state, second only to my own Texas.  Probably because the bulk of it concerns New Orleans, which is my favorite city to visit.  It's a kick to read about the streetcar, which I've ridden, the Garden District, which I've toured, the French Quarter, you get the message.  You read these books, and you can almost smell the creole / cajun food, hear the zydeco music playing and the cicadas chirping in the background.  (And if you read them in the summer, it's even MORE realistic!) But you get to genuinely like and care about Ruby.  She's talented, beautiful, like all of VC Andrews' heroines..but she's a lot stronger, I think, than the others.  Cathy, you almost dislike sometimes, because she knows she's beautiful and talented, that she gets arrogant from time to time.  Heaven you just want to shake and yell, ""GET OVER IT!!""  and Dawn, you want her to PLEASE get a backbone and quit being such a whiny baby.  But Ruby is gentle, humble, and strong..she'll take and take and take and then BOOM!! she'll fight back..although I was wondering at first how much of Giselle's crap she would take.  She stands up and accepts her mistakes, tries to always takes the high road..but even in her moments of weakness, not for one minute does she appear weak--except maybe in All That Glitters.  I mean, come on...I think God would accept a divorce from your half brother, don't you?  But I do love the Ruby books.  In my opinion, they are VC Andrews best work.   ",1

"This DVD series was way more than I expected. The beginner's DVD is a great introduction to Salsa dancing. You truly do learn the basics. You'll start off with counting, rather than dancing, so you'll understand the basis on which salsa movements are built. After that, you'll dive right in to learning the basic Salsa step. It does take a while to imprint into your brain--and the instructors know that--so there's plenty of time allowed for repetition. Once you learn that, you'll move into doing some basic turns and by the time the first DVD is done, you will have learned a couple dance routines. What's also nice about the DVD is that there are actually two instructors; One who teaches movements for the leaders and one who teaches movements for the followers. Because of this, it's a great DVD for couples or friends who would like to learn to Salsa.",0

Striper wars is about a subject very close to my heart and life - saving the environment.  I was surprised to find that it also goes beyond by describing how people actually struggle their whole lives to protect things the vast majority of us care about but a small minority control and are willing to decimate for their own personal gain.  The book also brings out how we can't let our guard down or trust that once the battle is won that things will be any different when the next battle begins - the war to save our environment is never over,1
"Noting that there was a hyphen in the ""Shakes-peare"" that appeared in many of the first publications of the plays and poems, Mark Anderson says, ""Hyphenated phrases in an author's name often suggested a concealed author--in an age rife with political and religious intrigue, when picking the wrong alliance or offending the wrong official could mean imprisonnment, torture, forfeiture of one's properties to the crown, or a death sentence."" Anderson hypothesizes that ""Shakes-peare"" was a deft allusion to the goddess Athena--according to Greek myth, after being born fully dressed and armed for battle, ""she is said to have shaken her spear, and authors looking back upon this legend associated her with the act of spear shaking."" Anderson points out numerous parallels between events in Edward de Vere's life and the works of Shakespeare. He also notes that de Vere sponsored a Latin translation of The Courtier by Baldassare Castiglione. Anderson quotes Castiglione as saying that ""a nobleman who is also a writer must ""take care to keep them [his literary works] under cover..and let him show them only to a friend who can be trusted."" This a excellent book makes a persuasive case for Edward de Vere as Shakespeare.",1
"As someone who knows the author and who provided some assistance for the initial phases of the resistance effort, this review will suffer from bias.  Nonetheless in my opinion the author has done an excellent job in presenting not only the operational details in the CIA's involvement with the Tibetans, but he has mined the diplomatic sources to provide invaluable background on the genesis of our assistance.  Why we became involved will become much clearer as the complex relationships and interests of India, ourselves, China, and others are detailed in the book.  Although the Tibetan resistance movement is not much more than a lengthy footnote in the history of the Cold War, nonetheless it an interesting and often tragic event made even more so by the fair-minded analysis of the author and the entertaining style used in the telling.  &quot;Orphans...&quot; is a must read for history buffs of this period and our relationships, overt and covert,  in this part of the worl",1

The full extent of his  achievement is brought out in this comprehensive and powerful collection of  essays, which show that 'Flaming June' and his other works are much more  than merely charming. I particularly liked Prettejohn's elegant account of  his four major narrative pictures. Now at last critics can write about  Victorian art openly, fairly and with insight.

"While writing an easy-to-read book is certainly a gift of the author's, she is either grossly misinformed or ignorantly misinterpreting the life of Mary Baker Eddy and the healing practice of Christian Science.

Therefore, the main character's torment over whether or not she should stick with her beliefs about Christian Science and her final decision not to were not surprising nor unexpected, for with that degree of understanding (or rather, misunderstanding) of this religion's foundation and precepts, she surely made the right choice.

This is Queensryche's debut. Too bad there is only 4 songs here but on the remastered version theres 10 songs performed live from 1984 on it! Anyway this is the most raw release from Queensryche. If they put 4 or 5 more songs on this album in this style than it might have been one of the best albums ever.1.Queen of the Reich- 10/10 One of Queensryche's best songs ever! This classic opens up with a great high pitched scream which Geoff Tate holds for over 10 seconds! The riff is great too. The song is in the style of early 80's power metal such as Iron Maiden and Dio. Geoff Tate hits a ton of high notes in this song aswell as some very low notes!  The solo is great and the harmony is excellent. The part of the solo where just Degarmo plays reminds me of Vivian Campbell and Dave Murray. The chorus is excellent aswell. The lyrics are cool as hell too! Incredible vocals and just overall an awesome song. I can't say enough about this song.2.Nightrider- 10/10 Another great classic power metal song. The intro gives this song a nice build up. Another excellent riff. Tate's first scream is cool as hell too. This song turns into an excellent fast song. Tate's vocals are amazing too. Another awesome chorus too. The guitar solo is excellent too. Another classic Queensryche song. A ton of great screams by Geoff Tate on this song3.Blinded- 10/10 Another great song. Geoff Tate's vocals  are amazing once again. This sounds quite a bit like Iron Maiden. Another great guitar solo and more excellent screams from Geoff Tate.4.The Lady Wore Black- 10/10 An amazing epic song! This reminds me a bit of Take Hold Of The Flame. The song starts off soft and stays that way for a bit. Geoff Tate's vocals are incredible on this song. Geoff Tate takes his singing to another level on this song. The heavy part is excellent too. The lyrics are great on this song too. The song switches between the soft and heavy part a few times and that makes the song seem more epic. Another amazing solo too! I can't say enough about this amazing song.The songs on this E.P. are masterpeices. Queen Of The Reich and The Lady Wore Black are 2 of the best songs ever recorded! Geoff Tate has never sounded better than on this album and the riffs and solos are excellent too. The music is very similar to Dio and Iron Maiden.Geoff Tate- VocalsChris Degarmo- GuitarMichael Wilton- GuitarScott Rockenfield- DrumsEddie Jackson- Bas,0

"It's rather rare to find a book whose introduction is half as long as the book itself...But here we have one...Tacitus' prose reminds me of Julius Caesar's and that of Marcus Aurelius.  These Romans didn't go for redundant verbiage.  A curious parallel in English is, of course, Ernest Hemingway.-His laudatory description of Agricola interlaced with philosophy is superb. My favorite quote is, &quot;...he always remembered the hardest lesson that philosophy teaches-a sense of proportion.&quot;  The same can be said of Tacitus and his prose-I found the section on Germania a bit less interesting because, well, that sort of anthropology just doesn't flow as well with Tacitus' terse prose. I was reminded of Caesar and his description of the Gauls. This discrepancy can't really be helped of course, and &quot;anthropology,&quot; as such, didn't exist at the time.- It was interesting to note the esteem in which the Germans held their women.  I suppose my disappontment stems from the modern approach to the analysis of societes and their psychology.  But Tacitus' unvarying faithfulness to the facts as he knows them without the vagaries of, say, the fantastical accounts of Herodotus is refreshing, and, to use a word currently fallen into disrepute, courageously manly.-A must read for history buffs and those interested in Latin prose without a thorough schooling in Latin itself.  I haven't seen the original Latin of Tacitus, but the style as here translated is nearly equivalent to that of Caesar's Letters which I translated in my second of four years of Latin in high school.-In any case, you don't have much to lose.  You can finish it in a sunny afternoon",1

Well, I read too, people!!!This is a good collection of stories to read if you are into SCi Fi or want to get into it or just need something to read if they've suspended your internet privledges.  But there are two things you need to know:1.  Gardner dozois did NOT ruin Science Fiction.  He is the BEST editor ever and2.  Its pronounced DOEZWA, NOT DOEZOI!!!!So now you know and thenk you for reading my review",1
"This CD got much play all through the Christmas season and for a few months after, until I finally put it away.  I anticipate bringing it back out again in November!  I have about 5 absoulute favorites on the song and the rest are all very good.  Sometimes I just have to stop what I'm doing and close my eyes and listen, it is that good.  I think I played this on a walkman with earphones about a zillion times, really getting such an excellent closeup sound.  I very highly recommend this CD!",0
" The only thing that would double my rating would be the inclusion of the weekly trailers which have never been seen in syndication. The clarity and color of these DVD's are close to HD quality.

"Sorry to disappoint many of you, The World's Best Sex Writing 2005, edited by Mitzi Szereto, is not a compilation of an exposé of steamy sex stories.  However, the twenty-five contributions that have been gleaned from such well-known publications and Internet sites as the New York magazine, Newsweek.com, Salon.com, The Sunday Telegraph (London), The Miami Herald, are rather  a collection of thought provoking essays, memoirs, and opinions from a wide spectrum of writers and journalists, all pertaining to different aspects of the sexual culture of our times. Freelance journalist Barry Yeoman relates how one research scientist's study of pornography, prostitutes, and seedy truck stops questioned the integrity and usefulness of the study and why the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development were funding the research. Initially, the NIH were delighted when the grant proposal arrived in 2002. Apparently, there were very few studies pertaining to long-haul truckers and sexual health. It was pointed out that in the USA there was evidence of an outbreak of HIV among truckers. Furthermore, truckers can affect other groups, once they arrive home. It all blew up when a journalist questioned why the NIH was funding research pertaining to porn and before you knew it congress stuck their noses into the fray, such as Representative John Doolittle, a California Republican, who stated, ""this flagrant frittering away of federal funds is borderline criminal."" As the Yeoman asserts, ""the incivility of the NIH debate has promoted neither good dialogue nor good science.""Sherry F. Colb, a professor at Rutgers Law School, fills us in on the details of a most unusual law suit wherein the plaintiff sued his ex-girlfriend whom he had engaged in oral sex. Apparently, unbeknownst to him, his girlfriend allegedly saved the resulting semen and used it to inseminate herself. The defendant subsequently gave birth and the DNA tests proved to be that of the plaintiff.  Interesting enough, the plaintiff only learned about the pregnancy and the birth when he was ordered by the court to pay approximately eight hundred dollars a month in child support. There is a an OB/GYN who recently founded the Laser Vaginal Institute of Michigan. This enterprising doctor offers his patients several elective female genital surgeries-the primary objective being to enhance sexual gratification for women.In Alabama, there is a sex-toy ban that was passed by their legislature in 1998 that makes it unlawful to distribute ""any device designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs."" As a result of this law, Sherri Williams, owner of a chain of adult stores has spent the past six years suing the state of Alabama to overturn the law.These are just some of the intriguing commentaries that shed light on our society's sexual hangups, some of which are quite hilarious and at times hypocritical. The World's Best Sex Writing 2005 is a joy to read; hopefully the right open minded readers will discover it. 	   Norm Goldman Editor Bookpleasure",1

"I own tons of blues CD's and records but I find myself going back to this collection over and over again.  The songs represent some of the strongest recordings by the masters of the blues.  Whether your interest is delta blues, piano blues, jump blues, Chicago blues or smooth urban blues; you'll find plenty to peak your ear.  If you're lucky as I was, you'll find some unfamiliar and great artists to lead you down new musical roads.  Some of my personal favorites are: That's No Way to Get Along - Robert Wilkins, What's the Matter with the Mill? - Kansas Joe McCoy, Floating Bridge - Sleepy John Estes, Mother Earth - Memphis Slim, It Serves You Right to Suffer - John Lee Hooker- just to name a few.  Since I've got a 1,000 word limit in this review it prevents me from listing every great track on the collection and all the reasons you should purchase it.

"I was very surprised to see just one review on Amazon of this wonderful biography.  This is the first review I have written here.  I always check out what readers have to say about books I have read or intend to read.  So I was really looking forward to a lot of stimulating feedback.  That being said, I guess I will put in my two cents.  This truly is the story of an American woman.  And that is why I think it is so relevant to every woman living in American society today.  Wagner-Martin does an exemplary job of illustrating how the genius and talent of woman can become neutralized through the weight and burden of early conditioning.  Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald was a creature screaming and yearning to differentiate herself from the overpowering presence of her talented and lauded husband.  The awful tragedy is that this intense passion to become her own person was so grossly misconstrued as mental illness.  It is tough reading.  My heart so went out to Zelda.  Yet I can't help but recognize that woman today still has an uphill battle in a society that has yet to relinquish it's paternalistic tendencies and endemic misogny.  I can't recommend enough this amazing study of a woman so ahead of her time, yet so crushed under the force of circumstance.  The one hopeful note I can offer is that from it women readers can feel galvanized to act as individuals independent of convention and impulse and need and rise beyond the circumscribed roles imposed upon us.  If only Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald, as well as that tragic icon, Marilyn Monroe, could have lived long enough to see how far we have come in the battle for the rights of woman.  But we have these beautiful women to look back upon to recognize the distance travelled.  I guess that is something to be thankful for. ",1
"After reading this book by Dr. Theodosakis, I recommended it tomy grandmother and 35 year-old girlfriend, both of whom haveosteoarthritis.  Not only has it lessened grandma's pain, but also her depression has largely lifted.  My friend, who is a fellow registered nurse, was thrilled that she was able to stop taking acetaminophen following her second month of taking glucosamine and chondroitin.  She believes the dietary changes she made after reading the book were also helpful toward making her body more supple, like a slinky.  I was indeed surprised to find some negative comments written by readers.  Perhaps they were victims of the many fraudulent products our there with insufficient quantities of glucosamine and chondroitin in them.  I found Dr. Theo's website to be very helpful in learning more about specific good and bad products.  I will continue to recommend this book to anyone and everyone who tells me that they suffer from arthritis.  There is hope!  EN",1
Art Lee's book dispenses with the &quot;myth&quot; of trout fishing and  presents in a clear and entertaining manner the true enjoyment of  fly-fishing.         &quot; Fishing Dry Flies for Trout on Rivers and  Streams&quot; illustrates that presentation and reading the water is more  important than looking like a hardware store on the stream and changing  flies every two minutes.

"Appleman's book is meticulously researched and wonderfully detailed. (Though you will find yourself wishing you had a set of really detailed topo maps to follow the action.)  The one weakness of Appleman's research  has to do with the 31st Tank.  Appleman seems to have relied heavily on the  recollections of Col. Drake, who commanded the 31st Tank. Drake's recollections are generally correct but more details could have been obtained from the other survivors of 31Tank. Despite this small personal quibble, Appleman's book is superb.John F.

"Dr. Cohen's book does the public a great service in discussing the importance of magnesium for maintaining a healthy level of blood pressure. However, as Dr. Carolyn Dean discusses in her very important book The Miracle of Magnesium, magnesium deficiency is a significant factor -- often the major factor -- in many other severe illnesses including heart attacks and other forms of heart disease, asthma, anxiety and panic attacks, depression, fatigue, diabetes, migraines and other headaches, osteoporosis, insomnia, and most cases of muscular problems. Unfortunately, the majority of Americans are deficient in magnesium to some degree and many are severely deficient. Because magnesium deficiency is largely overlooked by orthodox medical doctors, millions of Americans suffer needlessly from the foregoing ailments or are having their symptoms treated with expensive drugs (which often have unpleasant or dangerous side effects) when they could be cured with magnesium supplementation. While I recommend Dr. Cohen's book, I recommend even more highly Dr. Dean's more comprehensive (but easy to read) book The Miracle of Magnesium. Getting the right level of magnesium can not only mitigate a large number of seemingly-unrelated ailments, it may save your life.",1

"Caitlin O'Conner is off to college to see what's out there for her. Her roommate, Elizabeth Banks or Liz, is Caitlin's first problem. Liz does not like Caitlin at all and tells Caitlin that right away. Before Caitlin leaves for Christmas she gets Liz a Christmas gift that makes Liz tell about the way she is. After Liz spilling about why she is Caitlin goes home to find another surprise. Josh Miller, Caitlin's ex-boyfriend from high school, gives her a Christmas present. Caitlin is so surprised by this gift she doesn't know what to do. The gift throws Caitlin for a whirlwind of emotions and she has to conquer all of them. Caitlin does get through these emotions but what happens to her and Josh is surprising. At the end of the book Caitlin's life seems to be looking up again. Everything seems as if it's all going to be all right.	I really enjoyed this book. I think that it is my favorite out of the other books in the series. On My Own keeps you guessing on what's going to happen next. It keeps you wondering if Caitlin will ever make it through this tough time. I had no dislikes about this book at all. I could hardly put the book down.  	I would recommend this book to anyone who has already started the series. If you thought that book three wasn't the greatest or you thought that it was awesome and none of the other books could get better think again. Any teenage girl would enjoy this book. What Melody Carlson talks about in these books are true things that happen to every day girls like me. An average girl can pick up this series of books and relate to at least one thing if not more. I defiantly recommend this book, On My Own, to any girl from the age of tweleve to eighteen.  Everyone I think will have no regrets of reading this book!   ",1

"In reviews thus far of ""Decoding the Universe,"" both formal and informal, there is a pattern of confusion and disorientation about the book's real topic. Take Laura Miller's review on Salon.com for example. Though it is largely a positive review, she introduces the book as a book on cosmology and compares it, as a few other reviewers have, to Seth Lloyd's book on quantum computing, ""Programming the Universe."" Yes it is true, Charles Seife does write about the universe and he does have a chapter on quantum computing, but there is more to the book than multiverses and quantum computing. In fact, the very reason for this general sense of disorientation may be the real central concept of the book - Information. For most of us, information is, dates, faces, or names of places. It is an abstract concept. Contrast that to the concept of ""Information"" Seife introduces, a concept that is physical, a concept that is probabilistic and one that governs the behaviors of atoms, black holes and all living beings. The word ""Universe"" in the title may have been a bit misleading, conjuring a, somewhere `out there' in a subatomic realm, far far away, image. The universe in Seife's title is not just about the universe out there in the dark sky, it really alludes to a `Universal Law' that applies to all things in our universe. Seife's book is really about an emerging law, that may well become, once all the debates come to an end, the most fundamental law of the universe.""Information can neither be created nor destroyed.""The book begins with three important figures, Alan Turing the English mathematician who is considered as the father of computer science, Ludwig Boltzmann, who formalized the statistical concept of thermodynamic entropy and engineer Claude Shannon, whose Information theory is the reason we have such mainstays today as the internet and cell phones. In the first three chapters Seife introduces the works of these three men and the happenstance way in which, the exorcism of a demon (Maxwell's theoretical demon) establishes a fundamental connection between Boltzmann's entropy and Shannon's information. As a result, thermodynamics, the field in physics that describes the behaviors of mass and energy became ""a special case of information theory,"" and along with it, information itself became, according to Seife, a quantifiable and concrete property of mass and energy.As Seife goes on to tell us, the laws of thermodynamics are not the only ones to be subsumed by the concept of information. Even Einstein's theory of relativity, Seife insists, is really, ""a theory about information."" Specifically, the theory dictates the maximum speed at which information can be transferred in the universe: speed of light. He doesn't stop there; he takes us to the subatomic realms where he introduces the information character of quantum behavior. ""In fact,"" he says, ""all the absurdity of quantum theory - all the seemingly impossible behaviors of atoms, electrons, and light - has to do with information: how it is stored, how it moves from one place to another, and how it dissipates.""While the book does heavily tend towards physics and cosmology, there is one chapter often overlooked by readers and reviewers, that makes it more than just a book about the `universe as a giant computer.' This is the chapter about the information characteristic of life. Almost half a century ago, even before the discovery of the structure of the DNA, quantum theorist Erwin Schrï¿½dinger, realized that life is a, ""delicate dance of energy, entropy, and information, "" and said as much in his book ""What is Life?""The discovery of the DNA's structure and our subsequent understanding of its information role in living systems have only reaffirmed Schrï¿½dinger's intuition about the information character of living systems themselves. Today, as Seife explains, all living beings, ourselves included, are understood as, ""incredibly complex information-processing machines, ones capable of tasks that no other such machine is capable of, but information-processing machines nonetheless.""For at least a quarter century now, the information concept has been cropping up in different disciplines and specialists in different fields have been writing about information theory's influence within their fields, whether it is molecular biology or black hole theory. Therefore it is true that many popular science books written by specialists have addressed much of what Seife relates. However, most specialists, though aware of information theory's influence in their own fields of expertise, are often oblivious to the theory's influence in disciplines other than their own. This gives Seife, as a non-specialist a unique vantage point of sorts, and sets his work apart from other books that may have addressed many of these concepts before. Unhindered by the usual blinders of specialization, Seife is able to weave together, what has so far been considered disconnected stories, with one thread - the concept of information. Perhaps the most important thread of all. It is nothing short of extraordinary that one set of rules (the rules of information), which dictate the behavior of gigantic exotic unseen objects like black holes, and the behavior of our modern computing machines could also dictate how our own minds and bodies function. Seife's book is the first truly comprehensive treatise on the information concept in all its dimensions. It is an ambitious, necessary, and timely book that is a harbinger of things to come. It is the leading edge of a wave. As the realization of information theory's importance begins to take hold, there will be a deluge of books on this topic. If you want to be ahead of the curve, read this book. By Andrew Jennings, author ""The Invisible Matrix: The Evolution of Altruism, Culture, Human Behavior and the Memory Network",1

"Peter Gay needs no introduction, but I still feel that this work needs to be lauded for what it manages to achieve: it provides an exhaustively detailed socio-cultural account of the enlightenment that is as enjoyable as it is informative.  The main slant of this work, namely that the 18th century enlightenment was a reprisal/continuation/adoration of classical (hence Pagan) culture is coherent and functions as a solid structure to this work.  Highly recommended",1
I got into drawing again and I picked up this book after reading a lot of other books that go into so much detail of the anatomy. Detail you don't really need. The drawings were easy to learn from and it allowed me to do my own thing and not feel like I had to copy what was in the book. The simplicity of the drawings allowed you to see the basics of the anatomy and give you the confidence to go out and draw someone else. But this book is more for the animator and cartoonist who needs to learn the basics of human anatomy before going into cartooning. If you're an artist and like that detail of lighting and shadows this is not the right book for you.,1

They have laughs, argue but all in all, genuinely care for each other and get along together.  They help each other get through their relationship problems and even have shared some of the same guys.  Joan is the smart one, Toni is the wanna-be-rich one, Mya is the sassy one and Lynn is the hippie one.  I love the blend in personalities and love this light hearted fluff.  It's great.

"Dr. Dean Ornish's diet is proven to reverse coronary blockage and lower cholesterol; no surprise, since you're only allowed to eat beans and legumes, fruit, grains, and vegetables. Meat is off-limits, as are oils, dressings, olives, avocados, nuts, seeds, most dairy, alcohol, and anything commercially prepared with more than two grams of fat. You are allowed to eat the ""good foods"" above (beans, veggies, fruits, grains) until you are full (not stuffed!), but stay away from sugars: no honey, molasses, corn syrup...Besides drastically slashing fat to 10% of daily calories (the average American diet is 40% fat), smaller, more frequent meals, the reduction in calories and inclusion of daily exercise is guaranteed to burn more calories = weight loss. However, Ornish's diet does not allow for moderate amounts of healthy Omega-3 fats found in walnuts, flax, tuna, etc., so consider a fish oil supplement in addition to a daily multivitamin.There is no question that you will be much healthier following the Ornish diet, but it is a large commitment for non-vegetarians and difficult to follow in a society saturated by giant portions swimming in fat and trans-fat-laden takeout.

"Universally accepted as one of the major creative forces in modern music, Joni Mitchell never ceases to amaze me with her genius. From the early innocent work of the 1960's, to her groundbreaking opus, ""BLUE"", she has always challenged the norm. With ""Turbulent Indigo"", Ms. Mitchell takes the brilliance of ""Blue"" to the max. An hommage to Vincent Van Gogh, ""Turbulent Indigo"" not only pushes the boundaries of pop music, but redefines them. As opposed to other pop songs where Vincent was romanticized in lovely poetry, Joni takes a different approach. She writes: ""Tourists talking about the madhouse/ Talking about the ear/ The madman hangs in fancy homes/ They wouldn't let him near!/ He'd piss in their fireplace!/ He'd drag them through turbulent Indigo."" Hardly the stuff of love songs, but this sets a tone to the other difficult topics Joni tackles in this album. Who else but Ms. Mitchell would write about being sold into white slavery in a 17th Century nunnery (The Magdalene Laundries) and actually make the work soar! Who else would dare tackle physical abuse with thinly veiled refernces to a popular music icon and an actress, and do so in such a delicate fashion, in perfect juxtaposition to the harsh nature of the topic. And, she does this all while never losing her sense of art. Each song is a painting, not unlike her paintings that decorates the covers of this CD. And, each of these ""Paintings"" works together to create one solid work of a CD. Like most of Ms. Mitchell's greater albums, the whole is dependant on the sum of its parts. These are not singular songs, randomly placed on the order. They are chapters in a book- pull out one song, and the ""story"" suffers. Choosing the greater songs off ""Turbulent Indigo"" is like choosing your favorite Van Gogh Painting-they are all so wonderful in their own right. I do find myself drawn to the amazing cut ""Borderline"", whose keen observations of human behavior are reminiscent of those in the ""Court and Spark"" stand-out ""People's Parties"". And, of course, the album's grande finale, the writer at the height of her craft, is illustrated in the final cut, titled ""The Sire Of Sorrow (Job's Sad Song"". More Passion Play that mere song, ""The Sire Of Sorrow"" soars on sweeping melodies and brilliant lyrics that most writers strive for but most shall never achieve.",0

As part of my ongoing learning experience, I bought this book, and was THRILLED when I read it.  The book doesn't condescent, isn't ""Domme"", and isn't a boring critical read.  No, it doesn't give as many tips as one might expect, but it allows crossdressers to see themselves in a positive light, to learn that they are ""OK"" instead of abnormal, to see that one should walk with pride (and more than a bit of grace), instead of hiding out in the closet, fondling the pretty dresses instead of wearing them.  The message is upbeat, humorous, and wholly positive.  Thank you Miss Vera for helping to bring sexuality into the mainstream",1

"Like most volumes in the Loeb series, the emphasis is not on word-for-word precision in the translation, but on acheiving greater readability in broader terms. Since the original text in ancient Greek is provided on the facing page, the editors assume that anyone with a little knowledge of Greek can supplement the looseness of the translation by referring to the original. And in general, the compromises made in this way are good ones throughout the series. This particular translation is one of the more succesful in the Loeb series and manages to chart a course quite close to the original while also catching the flavor of idiomatic English.",1
"This is one of the most concise books I've ever read on meditation and Buddhism's method for leading a virtuous and happy life. This is the one book that brought together everything that I had previously read in other books on Buddhism and meditation. With so many approaches to meditation, it's a relief to find an experienced practitioner who eloquently maps out the elements of Buddhist meditation in relationship to the balanced development of both wisdom and compassion. In particular, I found it very helpful the way the author divides the practice of 'samatha' or tranquility meditation and 'vipassana' techniques or insight meditation. The explanation of the Four Immeasurables (kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity) and how they balance our practice that's useful to others as well as ourselves was also invaluable. The writing is condensed and to the point with many jewels of wisdom. I found myself underlining almost every other sentence. If you're looking for a clear outline for meditation practice and how to apply it to your daily practice on an off the meditation cushion, this is a great book to read, study, and put into practice",1
"I have one question: Why are these guys even alive? This is literally the worst album I have heard in my entire life. That's right, Vanilla Ice's To The Extreme is better than this. There are no good songs on this album because southern rap is the most ignorant sh** Blacks have ever been a part of. I hate the fact that they are trying to incorporate their retarded slang into Hip Hop. Don't tell me you think something is ""crunk""! You don't sound cool, you sound like an illiterate, easily led, retarded robot that watches too much MTV! ""Fu** ni**a"" is supposed to be the southern version of ""herb"". All southern rappers are herbs so therefore they are all also fu** ni**as. I also have another question. Why are the Eastside Boyz named Big Sam and Lil' Bo? How are you allowed to do this and not get completely ostracized by the Black community? I'm supposed to be down with that just because it makes me want to dance? Fu** that. A lot of people say that maybe they chose that name as a politically satirical joke. Yeah, they look like really deep dudes who ponder social problems. I was being sarcastic and if you didn't know that please kill yourself right now. Second of all, even if they were being satirical they would have probably known that the majority of their fans wouldn't get the joke.",0

"Despite what you may think when staring at this novels 600+ pages, `Seven Types of Ambiguity' is an easy read.  Telling a very intricate story through the eyes of seven different people, the reader is never bored and is never lost for everything and everyone is in perfect symmetry even if their opinions on matters differ drastically.  Elliot Perlman's writing style is magnetic, for while it's quite detailed and sophisticated it's never over the readers head.  As far as his writing is concerned, it is one of the novels biggest draws as well as one of its only deterrents.  The problem lies within Perlman's decision to keep every narrator sounding the same as the one who came before him.  Angelique, the kind-hearted prostitute, uses the same language as Simon, the advanced literature teacher, and that just doesn't make much sense.That said, the story itself really stresses the fact that almost every action and or motive attached is in it of itself very ambiguous.  You have the same series of events, the same situations, told and retold by seven different people and the ambiguous fragments of these humans lives become clear as day.  The story for the most part revolves around four people, Simon, Anna, Angelique and Joe.  Simon is a former teacher who at one time fell in love with Anna.  They've long since separated and Anna has been married to Joe for a few years.  They have a six-year-old son Sam together.  Angelique is a young prostitute who falls in love with Simon, and Simon, while not `in love' with her loves her in his own special way.The novel opens with Simon's therapist Alex speaking with Anna, pleading with her to do all she can to save Simon.  You see, Simon, in an attempt to unite himself once again with Anna, kidnapped her son only to be turned in and arrested.  He claims Anna gave him permission when clearly she didn't but feels that Anna will save him and they can again be lovers.  Caught in the middle of this fiasco though are Angelique and Joe.  Joe and Anna's marriage was already on rocky soil (Joe frequently visited Angelique) and now it's even more unstable.  Through the eyes of these five, as well as a business partner of Joes and a final narrator of whom I won't broach (the final part of this novel is so important to the brilliance of this story that I fear mentioning it in any way shape or form could potentially ruin the whole experience) we see not only the effect that this event has had on the parties involved but also who these people got in the predicament that lays before them.  Each of these characters is vastly different yet similar in so many ways.  They all suffer from the same insecurities and they all fail to read each other properly.  They take each other for granted, they trust each other too much and they tend to assume the worst in one another when it's obvious they are drawing the wrong conclusion.  Each person is willing to create a lie and stick to it in an effort to convince themselves of what they really want to believe.The most interesting of these characters though lie in the suffering spouses so-to-speak.  Joe, while not literally suffering since he in it of himself is not the exemplary mate, is torn to pieces by the prospect of his wife having an affair, and when he finds out that the other woman in his life, the woman he confides in and trusts implicitly (Angelique) is also associated in an intimate way with Simon he begins to unravel.  His narration is probably the most enthralling and absorbing.  Angelique though is probably the most sympathetic and relatable of the seven narrators.  She's kind-hearted, compassionate and real and while she battles with her love for Simon and her frustration in his determination to have the one woman he doesn't belong with we, the reader, and drawn to her and in essence fall in love with her ourselves.  By the novels end you'll be flabbergasted that Simon ever wanted to sacrifice his relationship with Angelique for that other woman.`Seven Types of Ambiguity' is fantastically written and engrossing from start to finish.  Its 600+ pages fly by.  I personally cringed at the thought of starting this novel, for the task at hand seemed almost too daunting, but much to my pure delight it really was an easy read.  I really have nothing but admiration for this masterpiece, and if it weren't for the one minor flaw I mentioned earlier I would say this was a perfect novel, but that flaw in itself is no where near enough for me to complain.  Don't hesitate to open this book, whether it be for the sheer size or the college vocabulary, for this novel stands alone as one of the most satisfying reads I've had the privilege to experience",1

"Prior to this biography on Dante, R. W. B. Lewis had established himself as one of the leading authorities on Edith Wharton and had also written a book about Florence.  Although he is not widely acknowledged as a Dante scholar, this brief volume is testimony to his obvious love for Florence's greatest poet.  Unlike many brief biographies of great literary figures, this is a remarkably balanced account of Dante's life and career.  Given the strictures on what can be covered in a small number of pages, other biographers of other writers often focus on an individual's life to the near exclusion of all else, or on the greater cultural context of their work, or on a discussion of the writings, ignoring the writer's world and life.  Lewis strikes a marvelous balance between explaining the historical-especially the political-context for Dante's life, in detailing the significant biographical moments that informed his career (including most of what we know about his limited encounters with Beatrice), and the development of his art.  Lewis's skill in refusing to neglect any significant aspect of Dante's life and work is laudable.Lewis's narrative progresses chronologically on a number of parallel levels.  He reverts on several occasions to Dante's genealogy, on the political situation in Florence in the conflict between the Ghibellines (who favored the claims of the Holy Roman Emperor in Europe) and the Guelphs (who favored the Pope and later split into the Black and White Guelphs, Dante being associated with the latter), Dante's platonic adoration of Beatrice, the development of Dante's poetry, Dante's role in the government of Florence, his eventual banishment from Florence, and the composition and content of his COMEDY.  I was especially encouraged by the number of theological figures who were crucial to Dante and essential for understanding the theological structure of the COMEDY.I do have a couple of minor criticisms.  One is that Lewis isn't always as sharp in his exposition as he clearly is capable of being.  There are also some curiosities, such as his comments near the end identifying Robert Penn Warren as ""the most complete man of letters of our time,"" a good if not great writer whom I believe will be largely forgotten in as little as twenty-five years (one wonders if Warren and Lewis were close friends).  There is an annotated biography, but most of the secondary works Lewis discusses are either out of print or not readily available, while many key contemporary texts dealing with Dante are omitted, such as Freccero's THE POETICS OF CONVERSION.  And how could any discussion of translations omit Singleton's, which is easily one of the highpoints of Dante scholarship in the past half century?  Two other small complaints:  no index and no chronology of Dante's life.  My own feeling is that there is never justification for not including an index in an academic book; the omission sharply reduces the book's usability.  Even in a short biography a chronology is useful, allowing one to make rapid comparisons between the various events in a writer's life and their work.Nonetheless, for most readers of Dante in English, this brief biography will serve as a superb introduction to both Dante's life and his work",1

"Murray Rothbard delivers an absolute winner of a text written in the same easily readable style of ""What Has Government Done To Our Money & The Case For a 100% Gold Dollar"".He has covered this lengthy timeline from the perspective of who the main players were, what their motives were, and what were the results of their actions. So what this book is NOT is a dry empirical statistical history...phew!!!What you do get is a terrific understanding of the power struggle running through the timeline between the Houses of Morgan and Rockefeller, with of course the supporting cast of the Harrimans, Kuhn Loeb, Guggenheims and the Mellons, as it centred on their quest for banking domination, via the struggle between the sound money gold standard protaganists and the monetarist inflationary camp! Rothbard weaves in the political situation throughout so that you are able to develop a rounded picture of the political scene based on the power broking of these financial elite too. Outstanding!!This history of the power struggles and the oscillations between sound money and inflationary monetarism will also take you through the genesis of the new Republic, the origins of the Federal Reserve, the New deal, and the Gold Exchange Standard.It's fascinating stuff, superbly written, with excellent, detailed bottom-of-page footnoting and an extensive index.My guess is this will be remembered as the seminal text on this subject in the decades to come!If you haven't already read ""What Has Government Done To Our Money & The Case For a 100% Gold Dollar"", then you will want to as this text will also leave you wanting to further explore sound money and the Gold Standard. If you then really want to get to the heart of Rothbard, then I wholeheartedly recommend you read his awesome treatise ""Man, Economy and State with Power and Market(Scholars Edition)"". You most definitely will not regret it!!!",1
What an awesome idea and tremendous videos from a band with great emotionally powerful songs.

"When I heard this film LOST HORIZON (1937), was being painstakingly restored and with much more footage found in the vaults, after seeing some of the footage, I thought I had to see it some day.  They say every film student and movie buff should see it.  The fact that actress, Jane Wyatt [Father Knows Best tv series (1954-60) and reunion tv-movie (1977), also played Spock's mother in a STAR TREK episode and Star Trek: The Voyage Home (1986)] also appears in the film peaks my interest. This version is with the complete 2 hours, 12 minutes soundtrack with only 18 minutes of found footage put back into the film.  Since 7 more minutes of footage was never found, this is replaced by photography stills and freexe frame images.  I won't say anything about the plot, but this DVD package does contain a nice pamphlet containing the restoration work they have done on this film.  Jane Wyatt's swimming nude scene is included.  DVD includes subtitles in Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, Thai.  Theatrical Trailer.   Special Trailer include an Alternate Ending.

"         'Black Sheep',released in 1978 was the first album by this artist I ever heard and indeed it's very atypical of Jan Hammer.So is 'Hammer' from 1979.Strictly speaking about 'Black Sheep' the album is a wild mixture of musical styles,starting out with the brazen heavy metal of ""Jet Stream"" while the title song and the pretty ""Silent One"" are catchy midtempo pop that couldv'e easily come off of the 'Melodies' album.""Waiting No More"" and ""Between The Sheets Of Music"" are the most musically interesting as they both showcase an uptempo fusing of blues,funk and fusion set to quirky arrangements.Hammer himself takes on the lead vocals himself on ""Hey Girl"" which strangly has a certain punk edge (?????)while he takes another hard rock turn on a metallic cover of Jimi Hendrix's""Manic Depression"".As for the next album 'Hammer'-a VERY different animal.Where 'Black Sheep' is pure transitional material THIS album,despite being the follow up takes a more drastic turn towards simple three chord rock n' roll,heavily influened by Steve Miller and Paul McCartney.Only the fairly funky ""One Day"" sounds anything like the old Jan Hammer Group.Tunes like ""Goodbye"",""Vaporize Me"",a cover of ""Oh Pretty Women"" and the Beatle-esqe pop of ""Sister Louisianna"" owe almost everything to mainstream pop-rock then to anything relating to fusion jazz,except that Hammer's electric guitar-like porto moog subtitutes for the lead guitars.Only the oddball,clished Eurodisco of the Georgio Moroder-ish ""Forever Tonight"" falls really out of place,sounding strangly like Donna Summer's ""Sunset People"" of the same vintage.In addition this CD includes a bonus cut,a Jimmy Clif-style reggae version of ""Oh Pretty Woman"" that's very exciting.         Taken together this twofer CD package collects two of Jan Hammer's most unusual and experimental music.Likely to disgust jazz and fusion fans for it's heavy rock n' roll content and not likely to appeal to fans of commercial R&B because of the genre defying material but for someone already exposed to the other music of Jan Hammer (ie his two albums with the Mahavisnu Orchestra circa 1971-72 or his two Jan Hammer Group albums circa 1976-77) these albums will fill some gaps left between 1977's 'Melodies' and his subsequent hard rock with Neal Schone and his latter 'Miami Vice' soundtrack work",0

"Through a combination of bad luck, forgetfulness and, yes, sloppy documentation, Michael Bellesiles's pathbreaking work could not sustain a prominent place in American historiography. The 2003 paperback edition of ""Arming America"" has now incorporated a number of needed corrections and revisions. Despite the abuse heaped upon the author, it once again stands as a significant contribution to colonial and early national US history.  Its well-documented flaws were concentrated in a few passages and tables presenting quantitative data.  But critics never really addressed the mass of qualitative data, much of it available for decades, supporting Bellesiles's thesis that our gun culture's historical ""roots"" exist largely as myth.  They also ignored his first-rate earlier research, notably ""Revolutionary Outlaws"" on early Vermont, which made him a rising star among historians.  His foes' success in derailing his career reveals their failure to accept contrary views, and the power of the NRA gun lobby.  The most substantive critiques appeared in ""William & Mary Quarterly.""  For a full account of the affair, read J. Wiener, ""Historians in Trouble."" Wiener notes that many well-regarded histories have more serious problems, and the controversy reflects the hostility of ""Arming America's"" enemies far more than the book's weaknesses.  Wait and see: Michael Bellesiles will eventually regain a reputation as a fine historian",1

"This is one of the best TV shows of all time. The clever writing, the way the plots are constructed, the talented ensemble cast, it all works. Bob Newhart is priceless with his deadpan reactions, and everyone around him provides the perfect foil for his brand of humor. Fox has done a nice job with this DVD set too, giving us the best picture and sound quality we will probably ever see from these 1970s film elements. The menus use a cartoon motif that I think is silly, but that's my only real complaint. There are a few nice extras in the form of commentary tracks from Bob Newhart and others, but not much. This show is a real classic, and very much worth buying for a mere 20 bucks or so. I have seasons 1-3 and can't wait for 4",0
"I can still hear some hiss and tape imperfections on good vibrations. It did'nt matter to me Vibrations still sounded loud and clear and for the best part cleaned up from the original master tapes. I like the extra tracks alot. This cd is simple and sweet and sounds great despite old original tape defects. I dont believe their ever was a stereo recording for vibrations. I enjoyed this cleaned up mono version of good vibrations and besides if their was a genuine stereo original recording of vibrations from circa early to mid-1966 I think it would have surfaced by now. Besides I think mono recordings sounded better to Brian Wilson because I beleive he is deaf in one ear. Enjoy this cd ep it may one day go double or triple what it costs now. Produced for a then staggering $100,000 Good Vibrations was the exclamation point to Pet Sounds in the fall of 1966 as the Beach Boys really stuck it to the Beatles. Due to these Beach Boy releases in 1966 the Beatles would have their greatest year creativity wise in 1967 as they would answer there well armed rivals  with Pennylane, Strawberry fields, and of course Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band. The Beatles created masterpieces from Revolver to their last magnum opus Abbey Road. My honest opinion (and this might offend Beatle and rock fans in general) 'Pet Sounds"" and ""Good Virations"" were the blueprints to all Beatle recordings from 1966 through 1969. I respect the Beatles for their writing and musical creativity. I really feel that the Beatles were so amazed by ""Pet Sounds"" and ""Good Vibrations"" that with their releases from 1966- 1969 the Beatles really tried to capture the sound of ""Pet Sounds"" and ""Good Vibrations"". There is no argument from me, the Beatles did create masterpices from 66-69 but honestly, never matched the sound of ""Pet Sounds"" and Good Vibrations"". If it were'nt for Brians over indulgences post Pet Sounds as the song goes God Only Knows what the Beach Boys could have accomplished for the rest of the psychedelic 1960s. Man I'll tell you there has been nothing before or after that sounds like ""Good Vibrations"". Brian Wilson is the man, the one man who made the Beatles and Sir George Martin realize that they to could be surpassed in talent, let alone by one man and that one man is BRIAN WILSON................",0

"Judge Richard Posner's 'Sex and Reason' has influenced me more then any book I recently read, lead me to a complete reevaluation of what the Law is, and what it should be.In this review I wish to concentrate less on Judge Posner's approach to the regulation of sex, although we will get there, but to his general approach to Jurisprudence.  Becuase if 'Sex and Reason' taught me anything, it is that the way lawyers 'do' the Law is in need of thorough revision.From my perspective as a third year law student in Israel, most of what the Law deals with is the meaning of words.  Lawyers and Judges argue about whether or not various actions fall into various legal categories, and, particularly, about ways of interpreting statues and precedents.  The main questions are 'how should one interperate the law'?  and 'By what method does one decide which interpretation of the Law is best'?In the United States, the main 'field of battle' regarding these questions are between the various Originalist positions (roughly, those who believe that words in statues mean what the people who wrote them meant), textualists (those who believe that texts should be read to be internally consistent) and living conbstitutionalists (the ones who believe that times change and the constitution - indeed, all laws - change with the times).In Israel, the main contribution is by former Supreme Court Chief Justice and professor of Law, Aharon Barak.  By Barak's lights, statutory interpretation is not originalist, nor is it textualist (""the interpretor is not a linguist"" is his famous catchphrase - sounds better in Hebrew).  Rather, Barak subscribes to a form of Living Constitutionalism which for want of a better term I'll call contextualism (Sometimes, misleadingly in my view, refered to as 'Purposive appraoch') - Barak argues that you can learn about the meaning of laws and decisions from their wider environment - the principles, laws and mores of the society.  When faced with a legal question, Barak will strive for Harmoney not with the language of other statues, but with their intentions, so that all Law would create a single, ideologically cogent, fabric.  In paraphrasing Hillary Rodham Clinton, one may say that according to Barak, It Takes a Village to decipher a Law.I emphasises these different approaches in order to demonstrate that the criteria by which we decide whether an interpretation of the law is good are very unclear.  But accept, for the moment, that one of these goals is superior to the others, and that we can evalutate various interpretations based on these criteria; We are still left with the question of what the marginal untility of trying to improve our interprative approach according to one of these criteria is.Suppose a new study slightly imroves our understanding of the original meaning of the U.S. Constitution.  Let's say that after a great deal of historical study and analysis, professor A has improved our understanding of the meaning of a certain clause by 5 %.  Now interpretations are 5% more likely to correspond to the original understanding of the terms in question.Well, so what?  Are we, as a society, better off because we get a slight improvement in statue interpretation?  That is highly unlikely. Even if we accept that one method of interpretation is correct, that does not mean that its outcomes are good.  Indeed, it is unlikely that s study of 18th century political philosophy, or a comperative study of the spirit of law, will lead to good social outcomes.  If you accept that it will, congratulations: you have just passed from the domain of Jurisprudence to the realm of theology. From of social point of view,  imrpoving stuatory interpretation based on any of the above criteria is a huge waste of time;  a great deal of effort and resources are spent on things that will not, frankly, matter.What I glimpse in Richard Posner's 'Sex and Reason' is an alternative: Pragamtism. The alternative is implicit here; I assume, not having read any of his other books (but I do frequest his excellent Blog, written jointly with econmist Gary Becker), that this approach is developed further elsewhere.'Pragmatism', as I understand it, is about making positive statements about the consequences of various legal rules, and then chosing the best one.  This requires sound theoretical analysis (Posner, and I, see the foundation of it in economics, but in principleit can be founded on psychology, anthropology, sociology, or many other fields, and Posner used reasearch from all these fields in his book) of the situation, and especially empirical research to find if the theory holds.  Thus, a pragmatic approach to the questions of legal interpretations and doctrine requires first making positive inquiries into the subject; Only then should we make a normative judgement.An example for this kind of reasoning would be the case for the supply of  contraception to Teenagers.  In the United States, some conservatives oppose supplying sexual education and contraception to Teenagers, and promote abstinence instead (in prgrams such as ""The Silver Ring Thing"", ""True Love Waits"", and ""Free Teens"").  Reasearch, however, demonstrated that such programs rarely decrease the negative side effects of Teenage sexuality such as unwanted pregnancy and disease (pp. 270-271).  As Posner writes ""the idea that puritanism may actually increase ... unwanted births is difficult to accept, but ... only because effective puritanism... would have the oppositve effect.  A Puritan ethic that has only a modest effect in reducing the amount of teenage sex may produce more teenage pregnencies and unwanted births than moral indifference to such activity would"" (p.272).Now, in my view, this kind of analysis should be paramount in deciding legal questions such as whether government support for abstinence programs should be deemed constitutional.  Perhaps the legal rethoric allowing the government to fund such projects is powerful - but legal niceties should not obscure the underlining realities.",1
"""Tenement house reform holds the key to the problem of pauperism in New York City."" That's Riis' conclusion. The evidence that supports that conclusion is embedded in his book, now a classic of muck-raking and a key player in the history of social reform in America. The fascinating thing was the reformers were fought tooth and nail not only by the slum landlords but by the poor themselves. That is just one of many items that make this story compelling reading, especially in view of the official facts and figures displayed and the pictures that go with those facts and figures. Wow! 27 people living in a room with two beds. 28,000 babies abandoned to the Sisters of Charity crib in one year. Massive deaths of children from, of all things, measles. The most common diagnosis made by the Summer Doctors (a corps of physicians from the New York City Department of Health) was ""improper nourishment"", none other than our malnutrition, but translated to that place and time meaning starvation. And yet milk was 2 cents a quart, a meal of soup, meat stew, bread, vegetables, and a stein of beer cost 13 cents. Add a cigar and another beer and it's 15 cents. Hence, the poor could have survived on minimal amounts of money, which, unfortunately, they did not have. The past is a different country said LP Hartley. He was right. They did things differently there.  A word of caution: Riis in his zeal does protest too much. Some of the pictures are doctored to look worse than the reality. Many pictures are posed and probably paid for. Look at the one on the cover. The boy on the left is awake and smirking. The ash on his right shoulder has been sprinkled there for effect. The boy in the middle is not sleeping either as it is impossible to sleep with your head balanced on your fist like that. Why would he do that anyway when he could rest his head normally like the rest of us? He is posed and in that position so that Riis can get all three boys in the picture. Another example of hyperbole:  On page 54 we are told that the child's temperature is 115 F. That is medically impossible as human enzymes and cellular energy systems stop working at 110.  By the time a temperature reaches 110, the patient is dead, has to be dead. 115 is possible if and only if they are on fire or heated by a source outside their body and then they still would be dead. As has been pointed out many times, Riis displays remarkable personal and cultural prejudices. His main fault is over generalization based on the assumption that every Jew is alike, every Irishman the same. Not every Italian is a gambler. Nor is every Irishman a drunk. Some Chinese do not smoke opium and at least some Jews are not misers. Because a person is not Christian doesn't automatically make them immoral as Riis would have us believe. Yes, the author has many faults. But most of them in this historical context are trivial. The results of his work are not trivial and speak for themselves: massive reform of wages, hours of work, living conditions, sanitation, social and personal hygiene, Public Health, and most importantly, public supervision of private greed and public modification of private greed by law.",1
"This is the hidden gem you are looking for.  It spent about a week in the theaters and few have heard of it, but it is as good as Room with a View or Howard's End.  Darker but deeper than both.  Not as popular perhaps because the ending is tragic, but the story and acting are top-notch. Embeth Davitz is fabulous (and fabulous to look at).  I will never understand why these wonderful period actresses come and go with barely a whisper, while sub-mediocre actresses like Nicole Kidman and Julia Roberts prosper.  Titanic makes a billion and this movie makes almost nothing.  Flee the topsy-turvy world and buy this movie.  It is a great escape to quality and feeling. ",0
"Although in hindsight, this book was perhaps not the best choice for a light, summer, beach-read -- I have to say that this is perhaps the most enjoyable introduction to Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications I have ever read, with two caveats: that by ""enjoyable"" I meant, ""slightly better than having sharp, steel spikes driven into my thighs;"" and that by ""read"" I meant, ""looked at briefly while fantasizing about golf"".  With that somewhat qualified review I can heartily recommend this book to anyone wishing for an introduction to the subject, having a curiousity about this branch of mathematics, or being threatened with torture save they read it immediately.  Thankyou",1
"Some people seem to know how to create and lead effective group rituals, but ask them how they do it and chances are they can't put it into words the way this book does.  I've read many books about ritual, and some of them are very good, but this book gets to the real heart of the matter - how to get to that indescribable place the a good ritual takes you to. Every ritualist needs this book.  Your rituals need never fall flat again!  :)One of the Pagan groups I belong to, Agave Spirit Grove, is having a monthly discussion group regarding this book.  I think this is a great way to help increase the effectiveness of a group that works together in a ritual setting.One thing I like about Isaac Bonewits is that he doesn't expect anyone to agree 100% with his opinions and observatons.  Even if you have many different points of view, you will find something useful in Rites of Worship",1
"Yes, you can use ordinary mini-DV tapes in this camcorder but there are two good reasons for paying more:1. The video encoding format of hdv cameras (MPEG2-HD) can have problems recording fast motion. This leads to ""drop-outs"" but you can reduce these by using better tapes.2. Different tapes have different lubricants. If you use different tapes in your camcorder, you can end up jamming your tape transport. Decide on one product that best suits your needs and stick with it. This tape has a special lubricant so it's probably not a good idea to mix 'n match it even with other Sony tapes",0
"Anyone who wants an inside look into the often-disturbing culture of inner-city policing should not hesitate to purchase this book.  Mr. Juarez writes candidly and courageously about the problems and conflicts of law enforcement, but he also writes a moving account of his own personal journey.  Stories of the author's upbringing in a working class, inner-city Chicago neighborhood are heavily drawn upon as Jaurez comes to analyze and ultimately question the morality of the entire criminal justice system, from the beat cop to the courthouse to the national agenda of the War on Drugs and War on Crime.  The power of this book lies in the author's ability to take a sophisticated, broad view of the institutional prejudices of the American criminal justice system while providing deeply personal, and jarringly unfiltered accounts of life on the street.This book is brutally honest and pulls no punches as it provides specific details of the underhanded practices of crooked cops: framing suspects, violent abuse, violent intimidation, theft, bribery, and vandalism.  The book also details what seems like the very routine practice of falsifying reports to cover-up the offenses listed above, justify an unlawful arrest, or to guarantee a conviction.  Mr. Juarez takes pains to emphasize that the overwhelming majority of the victims of such crimes are impoverished minorities.  He even details how policies are emplemented specifically to avoid targeting middle and upper-class offenders.Even though the officer exposes what seems to be widespread corruption and an institutional bias against poor minorities, I found it very fair.  Juarez in no way exempts himself and provides numerous accounts of his own misdeads and his complicity in not speaking out when confronted with other officers' criminal acts.  He also provides many examples of honest, hardworking cops and seems to conclude that the biggest problem facing criminal justice lies less with the individuals that make up the system than with the system itself.As said in the title of this review, this memoir reads like a page-turing novel.  Even given the disturbing details of misdeads and injustice, there were strong elements of an uplifting nature in this memoir as well.  The author's own personal journey is inspiring and admirable.  If only more of us had the courage to take an honest look at ourselves and the shortcomings of the  institutions that surround us, we would find our culture in a better place.  One can only hope this book might inspire others to that calling",1

I think this book is very repetitive and is a very poor attempt at showing why losing all of these languages is important.  They are comparing losing these languages to animals and plants going extinct.  They try and draw all of these worthless comparissions that do not make any sense.  This book is not even worth being picked up,1

"James A. Michener built a writing career on impeccable research of a subject and writing as if he did not have a clue about editing. It seemed as if Michener attempted to outdo himself in the number of words he produced for each subsequent book.It appears as if Michener could not pull himself away from his novelized form of history while penning this work on the Kent State shootings. There is one main character that is pure fiction, the ""drifter."" That character - as stated by Michener when he got caught in his web of make-believe after the book was published - is an alleged composite figure. In actuality, he may be based on a real-life male who was a government informant, hired to infiltrate organizations and then trumping up ""facts"" to prove they were prepared to unleash violent acts against individuals and institutions.But people as real as Homer Simpson and scenes that may have been built better in the back lot of a movie studio did not prevent Michener from defending the book. But a writer does not report news by penning a great lie.Michener refused to let facts get in the way of his storytelling. If nothing else, this book is a great example on how myth becomes reality & how an author can get onto the fast track for a Presidential Medal of Freedom",1

It is perfect , doesn't need any alterations only pressing",0
"I got a quaker parrot about a week ago and had no idea of how to take care of it.  After reading this book I know everything.  This book tells you the basics like the cage size needed and what to feed it, but it also goes into  some subjects that you would not expect like how to potty train your bird.   It staites many times how to socialize your bird so that it gets along well  with the whole family and so that it doesn't bite.  It also talks about why  and were the birds are outlawed.  If you want to know everything about  Quakers this is the book for you",1

"It's safe to say that without Chris Elliott's GET A LIFE, we probably would never have seen the success of the Farrelly Brothers or ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.  GET A LIFE set new frontiers in TV comedy by taking the standard sitcom format and turning it on its head.  The premise was simple:  a 30-year-old paperboy still lived at home with his rather less-than-concerned parents (played by Elinor Donahue and Chris' real-life father, Bob Elliott) who tolerated him as best they could while he got into one mess after another.  But this was no LEAVE IT TO BEAVER.  Whereas most sitcoms would take such a premise and turn it into a formulaic, feel-good giggle-fest, GET A LIFE dared to make its lead character into a bizarre man-child who could never see how truly ridiculous his inane behavior was to others.  He lived in his own self-contained world where he was the coolest and hippest guy on the planet.  What saved the character from being either a creep or the butt of everyone's joke was his underlying naivete and childlike innocence, which, in the end, was often enough to help him (barely) triumph over the evil forces in his neighborhood.Embodied perfectly by Chris Elliott, the indestructible ""Chris Peterson"" was a brilliant sitcom creation who managed to last two seasons on Fox.  But that was only half the story.  The other great thing about GET A LIFE was how the series took standard-issue sitcom plots and twisted them into deranged new forms.  This was like the TWIN PEAKS of sitcoms in the way it constantly challenged the boundaries of both good taste and common sense in order to get a reaction from its stunned audience.  The humor ran the gamut from low-brow to madcap to surreal.  In the 2nd Season, almost every episode ended with Chris getting killed.The GET A LIFE VOL. 1 DVD collects four great episodes from the first season, including the hysterical ""The Prettiest Week of My Life,"" in which Chris trains to be a runway model.  One of the funniest bits is a takeoff on the infamous Irene Cara scene from FAME.It's a shame that Rhino never got around to releasing the entire series on DVD, but at least the 8 episodes available on VOL. 1 and 2 are enough to give viewers a sizable appreciation of this short-lived but memorably off-beat sitcom",0

"Dr. Gootman has put together an excellent and concise introduction to  Calculus.  I would recommend this book to high school/college students or  anyone interested in math.

That was the year in which crucial preservation legislation was passed.

"""Flush"" is one of Alice's best LP's, hands down. Those who were disappointed with it were too busy looking for something else. This record is straight-forward rock with a bit of a new-wave era flavor. No ballads, anthems, or shockers here. In other words, not what many had come to expect from Alice Cooper, but ten quick and gutsy rockers averaging slightly less than three minutes a piece with some pretty hilarious lyrics. While all the songs are great, the ones I love the best are ""Model Citizen"", ""Pain"", and ""Clones"".Saw the ""Flush the Fashion"" show at NY's Palladium in '81, and thought it was great. The overall feel was sort of like the ""West Side Story"" tone of the ""School's Out"" LP with a bit of a ""Clockwork Orange"" twist. Very stripped down in comparison to the extravaganzas Alice is known for, but not a disappointment",0
"Wilbur Harden nasceu em 1925, no Alabama. Um dos primeiros músicos do Jazz a tocar indistintamente bem tanto o trompete quanto o fluegelhorn, iniciou sua carreira tocando R&amp;B. Depois de trabalhar com Yusef Lateef em 1957, gravou quatro sesões para a Savoy em 1958: três com John Coltrane e uma com o pianista Tommy Flanagan. Aos 35 anos, devido a problemas cardíacos, desapareceu do cenário musical, após gravar com o trombonista Curtis Fuller em 1960. Se não podemos incluir Harden entre os gênios do Jazz, podemos incluí-lo facilmente entre os melhores de seu instrumento, além de hábil compositor (com destaque para as faixas Wells Fargo e Snuffy). Nada justifica, portanto, o ostracismo a que até então esteve relegado. Prova disso você encontra nos dois excelentes cd's da presente compilação (gravados em 13 de março, 13 de maio e 24 de junho de 1958). Como se deprende do título, o toque sofisticado de Harden é acompanhado em todas as faixas pelo contrastante e já inquieto som de John Coltrane. Recém saído da experiência de seis meses com Thelonious Monk no Five Spot e já integrante do famoso sexteto de Miles Davis, Coltrane se encontra naquela fase em que procura posicionar-se como o solista de sax tenor por excelência do bebop (em franca competição com Sonny Rollins). Daí o sensacional contraste entre o seu toque e o de Harden (que explora os sons médios como poucos no Jazz). Ao piano (nos dois cd's) encontramos um Tommy Flanagan saudosamente econômico e preciso, sem jamais perder-se nos recursos fáceis de que se utiliza ao acompanhar cantoras ou em alguns de seus solos mais açucarados. Em quatro faixas é substituído pelo competente Howard Williams. Também em todas as faixas do primeiro cd (que apresenta qualidade sonora surpreendentemente boa)contamos com as excelentes e discretas presenças de Doug Watkins (baixo) e Louis Hayes (bateria). No segundo cd (que aparenta uma qualidade sonora levemente inferior ao primeiro) contamos com o apoio dos formidáveis e veementes Ali Jackson (baixo) e Arthur Taylor (bateria). Além deles, temos o sopro encorpado e inteligente de Curtis Fuller no trombone. Assim, é com bastante tranquilidade que recomendo este ótimo disco aos amantes do Jazz em geral e aos aficcionados por Coltrane em particular",0
"I've always wanted to get all of these movies for years, and now there are coming out in one box set and at a great price.  I've always loved Linda Darnell and she's in Zero Hour which the comedy Airplane is party based on.  Hot Rods To Hell has Dana Andrews and Jeanne Crain who started in the 1945 State Fair.  This movie has never been on DVD before.  If you bought these movies on their own each is about $14.00 on Amazon.com.  I don't see how you can go wrong with paying $[...] for this boxset.  Thanks Warners for releasing these movies for us to enjoy in a great boxset.  Thanks to Amazon.com for offering great prices.",0

"I passed my RHCT mainly because of this book. It is written in a clear, direct, and student-friendly context which lets you want to experiment the whole Red Hat learning experience. Jang is a skilled writer and although there are a few typos, it's an excellent book overall. It's the closest thing to actual Red Hat training. Use it to study for both RHCE and RHCT as RHCT's content is a subset of RHCE. Good hunting",1
"In The Rolling Stones Rip This Joint, Steve Appleford reveals the story behind the songs, recording sessions, and performances of the Rolling Stones in their long and successful career. An informative text is enhanced with more than 130 full color photographs and a profusion of black-and-white photography, a song-by-song description of the groups total output, a chronology of Rolling Stones highlights, a discography of singles, EPs, albums, and miscellaneous releases (including selected solo releases); original interviews with those close to the band (including Mariann Faithfull) and collaborators like Bobby Keys, Jim Price, and the Dust Brothers. The Rolling Stones Rip This Joint is a &quot;must&quot; for all their fans over the last four decades",1
"This book is the only one Vanda Scaravelli has written.  Her work has been appreciated as well as influenced by Iyengar and Desikarchar.

We have lost Vanda but this book is a fine connection to her brillance.  Bravo",1
"I have seen many documentaries about artists but rarely does one get to see a film about a single artwork.  A few reviewers have dwelled on the quality of the symphonic performance used in the film (which is very fine indeed) and the numerous bonus materials (which are informative but basically talking heads).  It is the feature film that I find amazing.  ""What the Universe Tells Me"" is nothing less than an entirely new form of documentary.  To be sure there are familiar touches: world renowned experts, classy shots of performers, dramatically rendered quotations from Mahler and others.  But the way it is all integrated-with artwork, computer animation, scenes from where Mahler composed, and narration by Stockard Channing-to form an experience about the very nature of experience, makes this one of the most exciting and pleasurable viewing experiences I have ever had.  Appropriately much of the power of this film is derived from the use of music.  All visuals are choreographed to it.  Animation and scenes from nature pulsate with it.  Even spoken voices are carefully timed to the Mahlerian waves of sound.  This musico-visual experience forms a complex accompaniment to the story.  And what a story!  The filmmaker reveals how Mahler was working with sound to express his own philosophy of meaning.  A philosophy that embraces all aspects of nature, including death and suffering, as necessary components for the ultimate experience.  This is one of the least sentimental films about music I have seen, yet the story is so broad and the experience so penetrating that by the end, one cannot help but feel moved by one's own connection to the universe.  How many documentaries offer that",0
"I've always liked The Talking Heads, they always had catchy songs that were fun to listen to. I must admit, my favorite of theirs has always been ""Burning Down The House"", but there are so many good songs on here, as well. The Talking Heads were one of the best bands of the 80's, that's when they had their best work. The 70's were ok, too, but their 80's work really shined. I'm quite happy with this",0
This book is good because it covers all aspects of dealing with your Mother-in-Law.  It helps readers to understand the tension the can occur and the impact it may have on the rest of the family.

"Great book that focus you in on why email has insidiously taken over our work and personal lives.  The book is easy to read and provides great examples of why email is so costly in terms of time and money.  If everyone read the book, email would not be the time trap it is now.I have taken several of the recommendations and started to use them.  As I gain proficiency in better tailoring my email, I plan on training my work group on the techniques along with buying them their own copy.One gripe, some of the things mentioned in the book that are supposed to be on the website, I could not find.  Otherwise, a good book for all email users",1

I love the Lord with all my heart and J. Moss has captured the heart of a Believer who loves our Redeemer! If I had to pick ""favorite"" songs, they would be: We Must Praise, Unto Thee, The More I Think, Psalm 150, Give You More... and my ultimate song of repentance and restoration, Me Again.  I guess that's about the whole album! God bless J. Moss for allowing the Holy Spirit to lead him in presenting a CD like this that blesses the lives of Christians every time we listen to it.  God be praised",0
"""Princess"" is among the absolute best anime to come along, in the last 15 years, and arguable, one of writer/director Hayao Miyazaki's best, as well. The visuals and writing are imaginative, original, realistic. Female characters are predominately featured here as in several other of Miyazaki's films, which I highly recommend (Howls Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Nausicaï¿½ of the Valley of the Wind).   I feel that his work is art that takes me to that sublime nether world where one can truly see with ""eyes unclouded by hate, mediocrity, or status quo"". I screened this movie during lunch breaks, at my job, for co-workers. It was well received by most who couldn't recall seeing anything like it before.",0
"This is really a silly book, but I love it anyway.  Not for any greatness of writing, but for its inspired silliness in plot.  Imagine a world (the alphane moon) where once there existed a hospital for the insane.  Imagine that the moon was abandoned by all but the inmates, who manage to create their own society.  I love it!!  Many times in my life, I have wondered which clan I was currently a member of!!  The wife of the protagonist is typical Philip K. Dick domineering, evil wife.  One wonders about his personal relationships.  At any rate, this is worth a quick read",1
"This CD takes me right back to my high school days and relives the good times.  There is something about the song selection that is so perfect for someone who grew up with these songs in high school when life was simple and fun, no worries and no bills to pay.  The nostalga alone was worth it for me but then I found this to be a great CD for parties and others from all ages who like to dance and have a great time.  The selections could not have been better!  I have not bought the others in the series as well",0
"Not much time here to write a review, but as I'm paging through amazon.com, this cd title flashed up, and though some brilliant cd's came out of the late 80's, this is truly one to be mentioned. Perhaps even one of my top ten, the debut by the Ocean Blue is beyond words. Sure..perhaps influenced by The Smiths and perhaps some other jangle pop British 80's bands, they truly have a unique sound of their own. Though their debut is their strongest, it's truly a gem to not overlook. If you like to blare music in the car and sing at the top of your lungs, this is definitely the cd for you",0

"I recently took this book on a trip to British Columbia. No idea why I bought it (except that I thought Lonely Planet put out decent guides), but this book was of far less value than the freebee tourist bureau handouts that one finds along the way. I'm absolutely certain that the authors did not visit any of the locations, as they provide no insights at all into the destinations, and their recommendations seemed outdated and sketchy at best. Bottom line is, I left it at a hotel because I didn't think it was worth the weight or effort to carry it around.",1
"The Black Jacobins is a timeless classic in both the  history and practice of liberation theory.I enjoyed the distinct pleasure  of taking undergraduate work with CLR James in the early eighties. His undimmed  passion and clarity shaped me deeply. He was quite arguably the greatest  unabashed dialectical materialist of the Harlem Renaissance. I heartily  recommend that you treat yourself to this,his signature creation",1
"Even though I felt the low price on this cooker was suspect, I thought I would give it a chance.  I wasn't expecting it to last long or work well - boy was I wrong!!  I have used it several times a week for going on three years now, and it's still working flawlessly - try to say that about, well, probably any other small applicance in your entire kitchen.Everyone should have a rice-cooker - they're great time-savers, not to mention meal-savers.  Even people who can't boil water can make perfect rice every time.  The reasons I love my Aroma cooker in particular are:  1) It makes much less mess than others I've used (rice cookers tend to blurble starchy water around the rim while cooking, but the heavy glass lid of the Aroma, and the vent hole, keep it from spattering the counter)2) It shuts off automatically when it's done cooking, regardless of the type of rice used (I still have no idea how it ""knows"" there's brown rice that needs a longer cooking time in there, as opposed to jasmine rice which cooks faster - but it does!) 3) It keeps the rice warm for hours if necessary without burning on the bottom or drying out4) The inner pot lifts out easily to clean.If I ever have to replace this little workhorse, I'll definitely replace it with another Aroma.  (I hope by then they make one in red!)",0

"Walker Percy was a shrewd observer of culture: locally in the South of his birth, more broadly in the western world of the late 20th century. The author's pessimism speaks broadly of decline and loss; yet in the midst of it all, his protagonist clings to hope. Why? Rather than resolving our questions, this book raises them in tribute and salute. This book will linger in your awareness",1
"I read this book in one sitting.  I had to purchase it after cracking it open in the bookstore and reading some of the harrowing accounts of those who were caught in the 1888 blizzard that struck the Nebraska/Dakotas with a sudden and unexpected ferocity.The book builds to the day of the blizzard by providing some interesting details about various families settled in the area.  He follows some sad families as they journey to begin a new and hopeful life in America.The most fascinating part of this book, the piece that made me unable to put it down, was the individual and detailed descriptions of those that experienced the blizzard.  Laskin writes as if he was there, describing what the victims who died of exposure must have experienced as they succumbed to hypothermia and then froze to death.  Laskin pulls in all sorts of resources to make this a very robust and three-dimensional telling.  He gives us detailed information about the weather patterns, the history of the region and what is known of the settlements in the area.  He pulls in personal detail pieced together to characterize various individuals and families.  I was on my seat waiting to see who would survive.  Some stories that were beyond hopeless came back to surprise.  Laskin explores the media response and the social effect of this natural disaster by recapping some of the articles written.A very finely written account, this is a must-read for anyone who enjoys 'weather thrillers'.  Laskin thoroughly researched his subject and then layered his knowledge with touching personal detail to give the reader an inside view of the events surrounding this most fateful blizzard which took hundreds of pioneer lives, many of them children caught out walking home from school",1
"What can I add to the laudatory reviews that have already appreared about this excellent work? Bruce Watson has done a masterful job of presenting this important (though often forgotten) episode in American history in a moving and engaging manner. This book should be welcomed by serious scholars and casual readers alike. Watson's style is intelligent and straightforward, but he is also a seasoned storyteller, who is able to open our eyes to the unmistakble human story behind these historical events. We never lose sight of the human faces on both sides of the strike lines here, for better or for worse. Watson's sympathies are obviously with the destitute and downtrodden workers of Lawrence. But his tone is never shrill or partisan, and his documentation is first rate-- thorough and meticulous almost to a fault (Do we really need ALL of these footnotes? Probably so.) We too often forget at what a high price our ""American dream"" was purchased. How much less prosperous and comfortable our lives would be had earlier generations not dared to stand up to the powers that be. Watson does a wonderful job of reminding us of the price that those who came before us have paid-- and of our need to continue their battle for justice in our own time.",1
"Other than Stormbreaker, this may be the next best Alex Rider adventure yet.  In some ways the plot is predictable as all Alex Rider stories are - except for the ending surprise in Scorpia.  The action is fast paced and is perfect for a teenage boy reader. Girls who enjoy spy stories will like it too. It is hard to put the book down.",1
"Wobblies! A Graphic History Of The Industrial Workers Of The World is an amazing history of the Industrial Workers of the World, an organization known for its eclectic and controversial affiliations as well as its strong stand against government and corporate exploitation. Wobblies! is particularly remarkable in that it presents its vivid anecdotes about everything from wartime witch hunts, government prosecutions, mob lynching, Mexican peasant revolts, the bombing of IWW figures and much more in comic book format. Black-and-white comic-style stories by a wide variety of artists, from vintage political cartoons to unfolding true tales of modern history, fill this superbly edited and presented overview of the Wobblies. Presented in an absorbing manner that invites the lay reader to peruse from cover to cover, Wobblies! is highly recommended especially for school and public library history shelves.",1
"I am a devoted collector of Kennedy material, and have seen most all photos of John and Caroline that have been published. But James Spada has done a wonderful job of seeking out the lesser known photos and making editorial choices which create a truly unique book.  This volume celebrates the joy of their lives and helps salve the pain we felt as we saw them suffer loss. I would suggest this book as a gift to anyone who loved John and continues to love Caroline",1
"I must seem like someone in great need of a unifying philosophy, because several people have tried to lend me theirs. Ex-boyfriends seem to think Daoism just the thing, while acquaintances recommend Jesus (that's why they stall out at acquaintances).  After reading this book, though, I can now say, ""No thanks.  I've got Adam Smith.""  When I was trying to get over a death in the family, this book provided me by far the greatest solace.  Smith summarizes the ancient schools of philosophy (and most interestingly, how some got perverted into serving as the basis of Christianity), and from them distills a manual for life that's both intuitive and useful.  What I like best about Adam Smith is that while his genius may not be immediately apparent, his common sense is. The last chapter of the book deals with the origins of language, and it's about my favorite.  Besides making me wonder why there are any linguists still employed, Smith touches on evolution and boolean logic (computer language).  Based on this chaper alone, he should be called the father of linguistics; if he had elaborated just a bit more, perhaps he would have been the father of evolution, as well. ",1
" Advanced Funk Studies has been a staple for drummers for over 20 years. The new DVD with both Advanced Funk Studies and Contemporary Drumset Techniques is a must for drummers who wish to understand todays linear style of playing, rock, r & b, hip hop, funk and soul. Latham breaks down the excerises so its easy to find a groove that works with the music. Mr Latham also spends time talking about the importance of proper technique and shows the importance of a strong rudimental foundation. I found it very helpful, easy to follow, with excellent examples of some of the exercises. And more importantly how to incorperate them into to todays music.",0
"A charming wordless book with intricate, detailed illustrations. I checked these books out of the public library and my children enjoyed them immensely. I have been periodically checking Amazon.com for the past two  years and I see that some of the books have been reprinted. Naughty Nancy  kept my children entertained at age two. They loved to turn the pages to  see what was behing the half page. Because there are no words, you can make  up the story as long or as short as  you wish. I think that young children  can easily relate to the antics of Naughty Nancy. Nancy is allowed to be in  her sister's wedding, but she gets into mischief constantly right up to the  end when her sister leaves on her honeymoon",1

"I've been into metaphysics, spirituality, and shamanism for years. I got turned on to The Old Girls' Book of Spells by a friend who gave it to me for my birthday. At first I was like, &quot;So what?&quot; because the Wicca thing has gotten so trendy lately I don't take it seriously anymore. One night I was bored and started reading the first chapter and was pleasantly surprised by both the humor and the depth in this book. I was also intrigued by the author's description of her connection to the Wiccan path. She's been a witch since day one. The spells themselves are out of the ordinary and anyone who reads this will be able to use ALL of them. I've already tried a couple and they work! There's something to be said for getting it straight from the horse's mouth. It's good to know somebody out there is living their truth and supporting the cause of the Elder Female. All you crones should treat your selves to a copy of The Old Girls' Book of Spells",1

"   ""They Made America"" has the dimensions, heft and plethora of illustrations and photographs to be a coffe table book. Should copies actually end up on coffee tables all the better, since more people will be exposed to this carefully researched and truly exciting history of the application of hard-won practical knowledge across two hundred years of the American landscape. Make no mistake, however -- this book is to be read and considered, not just glanced through.To the casual observer the countless technologies we use every day seem to be forgone conclusions to the specific equations of research and manufacturing. This is rarely the case. By the time a technology reaches a consumer level it is often decades old. Evans, with his reasearch assistants, skillfully traces the convoluted paths not only of single inventors, but how those paths are further twisted with the paths of other inventors. Political histories tend to focus on and mythologize the bewigged fops. Technical histories more often display the daily grime of how things actually happened. This is what Evans has accomplished.As with any listing of top people, Evans' is subjective, ultimately. As example, Howard Hughes made only a secondary list, receiving one paragraph. Evans' selections pay off, though. Not so much with the names we know, but in stories of people we've never heard of who nevertheless changed the course of events, directly affecting our lives today. I had never heard of Edwin Drake, to name but one. A disabled retired rail car conductor with no engineering experince, Drake figured out how to drill for oil. Neither had I known of Amadeo Peter Giannini, the son of young Italian immigrants. He brought banking to common men, rescuing them from loan sharks. He even established branches of his Bank of America in Japanese internment camps during WW II.As Evans points out initially, adding further twists to the history of American technology, and bringing into question the history we learn in high school, most of the people he chose were not inventors so much as innovators. Robert Fulton did not invent the steamboat. Issac Singer did not invent the sewing machine. What these two men DID do was put together all the parts in a practical way. Just as important, this book is the story of people and families coming to America and becoming or raising Americans, leaving behind the suffocating ways of ancient cultures. In the opening pages Evans offers a visual riddle. From one of those grim photographs of the late 1800s, picturing two forlorn boys and several glum men, save for two, he asks the reader to pick out the innovative genius. One of the two seems to be staring into the distance, perhaps thinking about his dinner. The other, though, is so clearly staring into the future.Finally, a word to film and TV producers. These are great stories, many of them virtual outlines for scripts. Take a look",1

"Perhaps this would work well in an area with alot of noise, such as a sports game, but I wouldn't recommend this for any other reason.  In fact, I returned this mic because it wasn't as good as my Panasonic GS180's internal stereo mic. I did identical tests with this mic, and with my camcorder's mic. The Atr55 did pick up better on voice clarity and depth when in close range, but it brought in too much outside/ambient noise, and the cable makes alot of noise!  It's hard not to rub against the cable with your fingers when it's mounted on a small camcorder. The Bottom Line: you may want to do research on a more expensive mic like the Rode Videomic, I hear it's great, yet haven't tried it yet.  I guess you get what you pay for",0

"Be careful with this program.  My wife bought it, and I tried to install it for her on our PC.  I made several attempts, and each time installation hung at a different stage of the installation procedure.  When installation hung, I could not cancel or kill it, or even shut down the PC without pressing the Reset button (on Windows XP Pro).I went to the support page of the web site, and found a FAQ item about incompatibility with Zone Alarm.  If you're not familiar with Zone Alarm, it is a personal firewall and security product that is very common among home users.  According to Nova Development, the only way to get Scrapbook Factory Deluxe 3.0 to install is to permanently remove Zone Alarm.  Besides being a serious security risk, this is an extreme measure to have to take.  This seems to be perfectly OK with Nova Development.  They offer no workaround other than removing Zone Alarm from the PC.  Personally, this would be enough to give me pause about installing the product even if I did not use Zone Alarm.  You have to wonder what the installer is trying to do that even the presence of dormant security software interferes with it.",0
"Nelson's text is a welcome addition to the offerings available on gender and nonverbal communication. Where many publications are either too academic and dry or purely anecdotal and lacking in empirical support, Nelson offers a rich middle ground. I have been teaching nonverbal communication at the college level for the past few years and am thrilled to offer my students an accessible, practical and fascinating companion book to their textbook. Nelson's move beyond the descriptive (men do 'y' and women do 'x') to more hands on applications of concepts makes the book a worthwhile investment",1
"In true Mary Kay Carson fashion, Exploring the Solar System : A History with 22 Activities isn't dumbed down even the slightest.  Carson respects children and seems to grasp well what they can be expected to understand - which is often more than what they are credited with.  As a result, her text is thorough and frank and can easily be read to would-be astronauts as young as 4 or 5 years.  And the illustrative photos are stunning, the perfect foil for the text in capturing the imagination.  From interviews with well-regarded scientists (including explanations of how they themselves became interested in studying space) to easy-to-execute activities to a very thorough timeline of space exploration, Carson has once again thought of everything for engaging our own little scientists.  I simply cannot recommend this book enough",1

"CHICAGO X was released in June 1976 as their tenth album (IX was their first best of, which has been deleted).  It was another excellent set that saw Chicago slightly revitalized after CHICAGO VIII (which reflected their exhaustion, though still a fine album).  The obvious hit (which dominates this album) is Peter Cetera's ""If You Leave Me Now"", a # 1 smash and the song that ushered in Chicago's tradition of being a ballads band (something that the others had trouble with).  With Robert Lamm taking more of a backseat in terms of musical direction (having hit his peak on CHICAGO V in 1972), Peter had emerged as the band's hitmaker and it would remain largely that way until his departure in 1985.  BUT...  that one huge hit belied the truth that there are other fine moments on this unballad-like album.  ""Once Or Twice"" sees Terry Kath in his element, kicking things off in a gutsy, rockin' way.  James Pankow's ""You Are On My Mind"" was another single (though not a hit) and is a very uplifting and pleasing song.  ""Skin Tight"" and ""You Get It Up"" are very funky tracks (reminiscent of 1971's CHICAGO III).  Robert's ""Another Rainy Day In New York City"", the first single, sees the Chicago sound placed in a Caribean style replete with steel drums and a suitably-affected Peter Cetera vocal that produced a minor Pop hit and a major AC one.  The album as a whole is really strong and impressive, yet it marked the beginning of a downslide for the band.  Peaking at # 3, it was their first album to miss # 1 at home since 1972 (after 5 in a row), although it still was a very big hit.  By the following year and album (CHICAGO XI in 1977) they would begin to lose commercial ground and suffer the subsequent death of Terry Kath, while disco and punk rendered them irrelevant until their re-emergence in 1982.  ""I'd Rather Be Rich (which made it out on CHICAGO XIV in 1980) and Terry's ""Your Love's An Attitude"" are very very good for bonus cuts.  CHICAGO X is a freezeframe of a band as the height of their creative and commercial powers just before it started to fall away.  Enjoy it",0
"Finally, finally, finally, three Bogart films that used to be shown endlessly on TV when I was a child and which I absolutely loved are finally on DVD!  I'm not talking about ""Casablanca"" or ""The Maltese Falcon"" Or ""The Treasure of Sierra Madre"", or any of those films that first come to mind when the name Humphrey Bogart is mentioned.  I'm taking about ""Across The Pacific"", ""All Through The Night"", and ""Action in the North Atlantic"".  God, I loved those movies!I might have just been at an impressionable age, but some of those scenes have stuck in my mind for decades.  For example, the atmosphere of the Panamanian movie theater that was showing a Japanese film in ""Across The Pacific"" (foreign movies in a foreign country - made the little kid that I was realize for the first time that the USA wasn't the only multi-ethnic country); the fact in ""Action in the North Atlantic"" that the ship convoy was going to help Murmansk (a novel concept at the time for this child of the Cold War - Russians as allies?), not to mention the fact that that was the first film I'd seen where Raymond Massey played a good guy - THAT was a novel concept; and in ""All Through The Night"", the New York gangsters being willing to fight a greater evil, and appreciating a damn fine cheesecake.  Another great thing about these movies is all of the fine character actors that are  in these films (Philip Ahn, Conrad Veidt, Jane Darwell, Sydney Greenstreet, Alan Hale, Frank McHugh, among others)- they always add a uniqueness to their secondary characters that is absent, for the most part, in today's films.I've wanted copies of these movies for years - who says dreams don't come true? ;-",0
"With good speakers, the sound on this tape is just like the real thing. I have to warn my husband when I am playing now, because it has fooled him so many times. I have several CD's of thunderstorms, but most of them have over-loud [and annoying] sounds of rain or waves on the shore and low rumbly thunder rather than big booming thunder-cracks, like a good electrical storm should. I don't use it to sleep by as many reviewers do, but to sooth and relax me, while I am working on the computer. It even seems to cool down the desert heat, some, while I am listening to it. This is the sound I have bought all the other nature CD's to find, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a realistic electical storm",0
"This is the second time I read To Marry A Duke - since I just finished the book on Lily I wanted to revisit James & Sophia. My first impressions were not as favorable as they were this time. I remember thinking James was unusually cruel to Sophia and while he was a tad unfeeling after they returned from their honeymoon he was not nearly as bad as I thought. James is so tortured by his family history, mostly his father was such a cruel heartless man, who actually was abusive. James was just to fearful of becoming his father and his feelings were so unbelievably strong for his wife, he just felt the only way to control his emotions was to stay away from her for long periods. Sophia being American was raised in such a loving home where everyone talked and confided and that is what she expected. Sophia really loved James with such depth and when he realized that he just had to distance himself. In most books this would cause a rift between the husband and wife that could go on indefinetly. Sophia was such a strong person, and she felt if she just chipped away at James in tiny bits, him revealing more and more of his hidden family horrible secrets she would expose his heart. This story is so beautifully written. James evolves slowly but in such a way that you understand each and every step and how everything starts to become clear to him. Indeed this is a powerful love story - and it might actually be better than the previous book I just read about Lily. Read them both you will not be disappointed",1
"I have been playing White-Wolf's ""World of Darkness"" games for years, even before the new ""World of Darkness"" came out. I remember when I first saw the previews for the new ""Vampire: the Requiem"" and was fascinated by the Circle of the Crone, a faction of pagan vampires focused on tribulation and creation. I've awaited the release of this, the last of the Covenant, books for quite some time, and now that its finally out I can say I am not disappointed. This book lays out the background, beliefs and practices of the Acolytes, and finally fleshes out WHY they do what they do. A much needed book.It opens up with a piece of fiction focusing on Trey ""Loki"" Fischer, a signature character from the Chicago setting. I would have preferred to have the ""Litanies of the Crone"", or some other IC mythology, but the fiction is interesting and does a good job of introducing the Acolytes. We then go on to the introduction, which tries to give an overview of the Acolytes and their beliefs, explaining what they are (and what they aren't). Essentially, they are a network of cults sharing some common beliefs, but with many regional differences. We also get some info on Cruac, and the Circle's relation with spirits. Theres also an interesting bibliography of books on Paganism that can be used as inspiration, though imho it leaves out some key titles (like say, ""The Golden Bough"", with all the accompanying myths of sacrifice and rebirth). But then, thats just my opinion. On to the real juicy stuff.The first chapter gives details on the history of the Circle of the Crone, mostly as a network of pagan cults organized by a shadowy figure called the Blind Queen, and forced together by persecution from the Lancea Sanctum. From there, we go on to a chapter of the Circle's beliefs, practices and organization. The roles of the Heirophant and Chorus are explained and expanded upon, alongside less common positions like the Skald (a bard or tale-teller), Valkyrja (warriors), Haruspex (diviners), and so forth. More interesting, there are also mythic roles like the Maiden, the Fool, the Hero, and the Crone. These are more spiritual roles, and each is given examples from various pagan myths the world over. Beyond that, we also get a look at Cruac, the Acolytes' relations with the spirit world, views on tribulation and creation, holy nights, worship and other topics. A new background, Temple, is given, along with a connected Cruac ritual. Essentially, it's a place of worship that functions much as a Haven. This chapter alone should be essential reading for any chronicle involving the Acolytes. However, it also requires alot of work for the ST, since the Circle of the Crone can vary so much from location to location.Chapter three focuses on politics of the Acolytes, how they find converts, how they seek out tribulation (often through conflict with other Covenants) and how they fit into a given domain. Theres some interesting ideas in here, including the idea of Acolytes creating underground communities. The next chapter focuses on the factions and bloodlines, often a big draw for players. Numerous examples of factions are given, including the People of the Land (small rural covens), the Second Descent (devotees of chthonic gods of darkness), the Hag (vampires who are haunted by nightmares of a Crone like figure), Disciples of the Silence (nihilist worshippers of nothingness), Siapn (violently anti-Christian cultists from South America), Amanotsukai (who follow a corrupted form of Japanese Shinto), Daughters of the Goddess (fanatical feminist Goddess worshippers), and the Semioticians (scholars who study Cruac and other forms of blood magic). Examples of the variations on Cruac practiced by the different factions are given, mostly for flavor. Theres also an Acolyte ghoul family, the Bellsmeade, hidden in there. They are a small, inbred cult of mortals in an isolated hotel, who are taught to worship their creator as a god. Fun stuff!The bloodlines are really exciting. A bit slanted, but still exciting. Of the five bloodlines, three are Gangrel (my favorite Clan ironically), and three are heavily female focused. The Asnam are a Daeva lineage that consider themselves gods, and have a Discipline that lets them connect with their worshippers (the final level actually allows them to reincarnate!). The Carnon are a lineage of Gangrel who live like pagan rock stars, and usually burn out fairly quickly. They embody the Horned God, and learn Nightmare in-Clan. The Childer of the Morrigan are mostly female warriors, and are a Gangrel lineage with Potence in-Clan and the ability to learn the Touch of the Morrigan ritual without knowing Cruac. The Gorgons are a serpent-themed bloodline of Ventrue claiming descent from Medua, and have a snake-like Discipline called Amphivena. The Mara, or Lampreys, are a lineage of aquatic Gangrel who learn Obfuscate as a Clan Discipline. Once again, variations on Cruac are presented for the Mara, whose rituals are all conducted underwater. It's mostly flavor, but still very cool to work with.The next chapter explores the magics of the Circle, including the two new Disciplines for the above mentioned bloodlines (Ralab and Amphivena), several Devotions, and a huge amount of information on Cruac. All in all, we get some 25 Cruac rituals, including a few others hidden throughout the book. Information on how Cruac works, alternative styles of Cruac, creating and learning new rituals, and how it interacts with the spirit world is given. The rituals given are incredibly varied. There are rituals for calling upon spirits, divining the future, manipulating the weather, creating gargoyles and homunculi, storing blood in buboes, gaining power through sacrifice, changing one's Haven temporarily, and creating weapons that draw blood from an opponent. Many rituals for Acolytes to play with. The final chapter gives a number of NPCs for the Storyteller to use, including both combatants and non-combatants. Archetypes like Liason to the Lupines, Soothsaying Whore, and Acolyte Sheriff are given, all of which can easily be adapted to any chronicle with a little work. Or serve as inspiration for players, if they are so inclined.This is ultimately a great book, probably the best of the Covenant books, and it has been well worth the like. I came away from it with lots of ideas for my games. It exceeded my expectations. If you have no idea how to play or run the Circle of the Crone, then this book will help you. It does require you to flesh out how the Acolytes function on a local level, given that they are more a network of cults with a few shared beliefs and practices, but it does a good job giving you ideas to work with. I especially like how it draws upon mythological archetypes and how it details the different styles of Cruac. The factions and bloodlines were pretty interesting too. This book is essential for STs, and for any player who wants to play an Acolyte. Theres just so much useful stuff in here",1
"Once upon a time there was a cute, little, green inch worm hanging out on a piece of grass.  One day, a robin came up to eat him, but the inch worm talked the robin into letting him measure the robin's tail.  Being such a useful worm, the robin did not eat him, but took him to other birds so that they could have something measured by the smart inch worm.  Finally, a nightingale told the worm to measure his song or he would eat the little inch worm.  Using his little worm brain, the inch worm began measuring the song until he had inched away to safety.  This wonderful book, written and illustrated by Leo Lionni, won the Caldecott Honor in 1961.  He has taken a little worm and made the reader fall in love with it through the worm's usefulness in measuring and his cunning ability to escape the hungry nightingale.  Even though there are many different scenes, with many various shades of green on them, Lionni has illustrated the little worm in such a way that the reader can always point him out.  Children would enjoy finding the worm on each page, especially at the end of the book when he is hiding from the nightingale.  Also, we always see the story from an outside perspective; eye level with the grass.  It is as if we are another small animal looking in on the story.  The background of each page is pretty much the same.  All Lionni has illustrated on each page is the worm and the other details that are needed during that part of the story.  For example, while the inch worm is measuring the legs of the heron, Lionni has only portrayed the heron with the worm inching down its leg.  I think this technique is good for younger audiences because it helps children focus on the story and keeps their attention for more specific details.  This also makes sense because there is a small portion of text to read on each page which means the audience does not have much time to look at the illustrations while the reader is reading to them.  As for colors, Lionni has kept them realistic.  For example, the flamingo is a bright pink whereas the nightingale's colors are calmer.  Overall, the colors in the book make the readers feel at ease and calm.  The dull greens of the grass and the open, white background keeps the reader moving along at a steady pace.  It's almost as if we know that the inch worm is going to outsmart the different birds and there is no need to get over-excited.  Lionni has intertwined the illustrations and the text in a way that they are dependent on each other.  Although you could get the gist of the story by either reading the text or looking at the pictures, by having the illustrations support the text, the reader gets a more detailed, visual story.  However, Lionni leaves room for the imagination to add on to the story at any time.	Overall, I loved this book.  Lionni has creatively illustrated this cute story, making children and adults want to read it over and over again.  	If you are looking for instructional ideas, I would read this story to students in primary grades before doing a lesson on measuring.  Then I would have students measure different things around the classroom including themselves.  I would also use this book when talking about different types of art.  I would have children do a collage or make something with decoupage.  They could even re-create a scene from the book!",1
"Whether your child is 1 or 50, or you are praying for a friends child, niece or nephew, this book's for you. The chapters are short and to the point, it covers just about everything, and there is a prayer at the end of each chapter. It is a book I could read again and again",1
"This pedometer is easy to use and pretty decent looking.  Those are the only good things I can say about it.  It simply does not stay on.  I, too, have had to use a safety pin to make sure I don't lose it.  Maybe I have a defective device, but this is anything but accurate.  I consistently walk a measured 5 mile route every day.  One day the steps will be 5800, the next day 12800, the next day 10300.  Which is accurate?  Are any of them?  I can't rely on it.  When testing the device for accuracy in walking 50 steps, it never got it right.  Most of the time it was over the 50 steps, 2 times it was way under the 50 steps.  I would not recommend this one",0

"The authors no doubt know Investment analysis. Unfortunately they don't communicate that information too well. Frequently happens when Phd's forget they are writing to students, not other Phd's. Bought this book for a senior level finance course, required to complete my major in finance. Even my Prof. started the course with, ""the textbook is difficult to read but just follow my notes and you should do ok"". Not too good of an endorsement for a textbook. Now, after completing the course, I am searching for another text on the subject to keep as a reference. Even after the lectures, this book's explinations of the same topics are difficult to follow",1
"This powerful book helps to change the way you look at and feel about your body. This is not a diet and nutrition book. It is a book to help you love your body as it is, right now, TODAY! It helped me to finally see that my body is my friend not my enemy. Rhonda gives real life examples of how this works and why it is important to love your body and stop using it as an excuse to keep you from doing the things you want to do and living the life you so deeply desire.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is challenged to love their body or use it as an excuse.",1
"This is the 19th of the series.  I do agree with some others that there weren't quite as many surprises in this one but it was still good.  Braun's specialty (in my opinion) is character development, and as a couple of  other reviewers have mentioned, the characters are written in so much  detail that after reading the books we come to feel they are real people!   I especially enjoyed getting to know Wetherby Goode, who has previously  been something of a joke.  Also I liked the cat naming information and the  &quot;tales&quot; Qwill was collecting.  I wish that the first death in the  book had been investigated more, and I wish that the second death hadn't  occurred at all.  (That is one thing I don't like - Ms. Braun occasionally  kills off a character that I have come to like!)  P.S. If you haven't read  any of these books, start at the beginning and read them in order.  The  character development will be much more evident.  First is The Cat Who  Could Read Backwards.  P.S.2 - Please, no Sean Connery playing Qwill.   Maybe Sam Elliot - but perhaps someone a little more substantial  physically?  Why haven't these been made into movies by now",1
"This is an amazing compact camera, with all the wanted features. I was looking for a camera that is compact and has good optical zoom as well as takes gr8 pictures. I was stunned by how much this little thing can deliver. It's just too amazing...I would definitely recommend it.

"I am part of a consultation group of early career psychologists and we regularly discuss issues related to starting and building a practice, marketing, developing a niche area, and issues related to the business of owning one's practice. This has book has been referenced numerous times by our group and has been so helpful and informative to us, particularly b/c these issues have not been taught in graduate school or in our training. I would not forge ahead in the field of psychology and in your career as a psychologist without looking at this book first.",1
"Having already read Ted L. Nancy's first volume, I was more than excited to read more outrageous letters.  Similar to the Laszlo Letters (but much better), Ted L. Nancy writes zany letters to all sorts of organizations (companies, governments, the military, hotels and more) to make his hilarious requests.  Though they are, of course, outlandish, but that's the entertainment.Equally as entertaining are some of the response letters.  Because most aren't totally sure that Ted L. Nancy is fake, they have to diplomatically word their letters -- great stuff.  Jerry Seinfeld has written the forward to both books by Nancy, causing many to speculate that he is the real author.  Check out the wikipedia page on Ted Nancy for more details, but I'm not completely convinced that Seinfeld is the real author.  Nevertheless, More Letters From a Nut continues the great tradition from before, and also makes for great comedy when read aloud.  Enjoy it!",1
"FIRST DEGREE is a sequel that will delight the fans of David Rosenfelt's five star debut novel OPEN AND SHUT (review 10/23/2004). The following summary from my review of that book is equally applicable here. This is neither a novel of lasting historical significance or a truly overwhelming literary achievement. Rather it is a story that is great fun to read because of the enjoyable protagonist that the author has created to be the narrator. The story is related in the first person by attorney Andy Carpenter, who lives and practices law in Paterson, New Jersey. Andy's reputation is that of an excellent criminal defense attorney who is occasionally willing to engage in whatever courtroom theatrics and bizarre behavior are necessary to gain a verdict of not guilty for his clients. This methodology of course endears him to most defendants but frequently tries the patience of the opposing district attorney and more ominously on occasion puts him in risk of being held in contempt by the presiding judge. He is often compared, not always favorably, with his father, the legendary and respected ex-district attorney Nelson Carpenter.As readers of the previous novel will be aware, when this novel commences Andy is considerably richer and much more widely recognized than he was during that story. The wealth is a function of his receipt of a totally unexpected inheritance; the fame is a function  of the central storyline of that novel - his success in the high profile reversal of the sentence of death row inmate Willie Miller (who had been prosecuted by Andy's father). If you are a reader who enjoyed OPEN AND SHUT and have looked forward to following Andy's further courtroom exploits, this book will delight you. Howver, if you have not read that book, there are two reasons why I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU READ IT PRIOR TO READING FIRST DEGREE. The most important reason is that paradoxically, in order to provide the information necessary to make this novel totally understandable as a standalone story, at various points enough background detail is summarized from the previous book that it would effectively act as a substantial spoiler to readers who became captivated enough by Andy and the other characters (and dogs) in FIRST DEGREE that they then decided to read the earlier book. Second, I believe that OPEN AND SHUT not only sets the table for readers of FIRST DEGREE, but is marginally more enjoyable for reasons which I will summarize at the end of this review. Thus, if you don't enjoy OPEN AND SHUT there will be no reason for you to read this book anyway; whereas if you do like the earlier novel as much as I did, you will have had the satisfaction of watching the plot in that book unfold as it was intended rather than already having summary knowledge of all the key elements of the story.Once again, the author has managed to create a compellingly fast read. One interesting and quite effective technique is that there are frequent section breaks (usually between every eight to fifteen pages) but no chapter notations to stop the flow of the story. Just as with the earlier novel, this book begins with Andy reminiscing with regard to the importance of the words ""opening day"" in his relationship with his recently deceased father. They had shared memorable times enjoying the thrill of many season openers at Yankee Stadium; he is planning to continue that legacy  by ""passing the sacred tradition on"" to his only remaining family member, the irrepressible golden retriever Tara (who was an essential element of my enjoyment of the first novel given the resemblance of her personality to that of my own golden retriever). Of course, he realizes that this will require some creativity and adaptability on his part, and this event forms the delightful introductory four pages of the story.  However, Andy's and Tara's enjoyment of the day is interrupted by startling news from Laurie Collins, the chief investigator for his law practice and the woman with whom he has fallen in love.Laurie stuns Andy with an announcement that former Police Lieutenant (and Laurie's boss when she was a detective in the Patterson Police Department) ""Alex Dorsey is dead ... somebody decapitated him, then poured gasoline on his body and set it on fire."" Despite Laurie's contentious relationship with Dorsey, which was the reason that she had resigned from the Department, Andy is amazed at her totally atypical emotional response that she is glad that Dorsey is dead. Shortly thereafter, his amazement turns to shock when he is approached by a stranger, the mysterious Geoffrey Stynes, to be his legal representative in the ""slight chance"" that he is charged with the murder of Alex Dorsey. When the lowlife Oscar Garcia is charged by the police instead of Stynes, Andy is faced with the dilemma that crucial information which he possesses concerning the case is covered by attorney-client priviledge and therefore cannot be divulged to the police. Thus begins another murder mystery/detective story/legal thriller with frequent misdirection (of Andy and the police as well as the reader, who is seeing this unfold through Andy's first person narration of events). There are enough twists to keep the story interesting; then soon the case becomes even more personal to Andy than he could have imagined. All the main characters who remain alive from OPEN AND SHUT play meaningful roles in this story; hopefully the author plans to continue to evolve their personalities through future volumes of their exploits, combining the style of Robert Parker in his Spenser series with legal exploits more reminscent of Dismas Hardy in the books by John Lescroart. In addition to Andy, Laurie, and Tara, Willie Miller plays a significant role in this book including his introduction of a new friend to Tara and his discovery of a cause near the end of the story that will complete his rehabilitation and surprisingly engage Andy as well. Police Lieutenant Pete Stanton and disillusioned lawyer Kevin Randall (the owner of the Lawdromat which dispenses free legal advice while you do your laundry) also figure prominently in the story. To the delight of the author's fans, newspaper reporter Vince Sanders, Andy's secretary Edna, the ""unchallenged crossword puzzle master of the Western World"" and Judge ""Hatchet"" Henderson also reappear with their eccentricities integral components of this tale. .There is even a cameo apearance by Andy's former wife Nicole. In summary, this is another well thought out plot; the flow of the story is handled exceptionally well, the character development is uniformly good, the sports analogies provide marvelous insights, and Andy's wonderful pesonality makes the story sing and the reader smile.  There are three reasons why I rated this book only four and a half stars in comparison with the full five stars that I gave to the earlier novel. First, the potential element of surprise of one of the really crucial twists in the story and its shock value is spoiled by the book jacket notes and some of the reviews which I read before purchasing the book. Thus, I suggest that if possible you avoid reading that information, but I suspect that most readers will have the same knowlrdege that I did before they ever start the story. While that is a minor factor in my downgrade, the other factors are more important. Second, even though the actions involved were a crucial element of the storyline, I was as stunned and saddened as Andy by the collateral damage to one of the good guys that resulted from the investigation of Dorsey's apparent murder. Third, and by far the most significant factor, was the fact that the mastermind behind Dorsey's death became obvious to me (and I believe many readers will share my insight) well before Andy made the connection. While admittedly sometimes it is easier for someone somewhat more removed from the frantic pace of the day-to-day investigative revelations and somewhat less emotionally involved than Andy to piece together the directions in which the clues lead, this fact nevertheless slightly detracted from my enjoyment of the story even though I still needed Andy to fill in the outline which I had glimpsed. Enjoyable characters, amusing dialog including Andy's wonderful sarcasm, moments of tense action, and the expected courtroom theatrics - highly recommended when you are in search of a fast paced light reading experience.Tucker Anderse",1
"I've been waiting for a book like this for a really long time. The book is fact filled, easy to read (for those new to religious concepts &amp; sects) and informative. The author breaks the sects up so that we can better  understand the denominations as a whole. The section on Apocalptic  Christianity is one of the best. Many members of the sects discussed might  be offended as it does point out inaccuracies or missteps within the sect.  A great read!",1
"This movie is a complete gem, and I don't know what exactly the critics that panned it (I've even read that the closing theme voiced by Lauper was a flop) were thinking.  Granted, it is probably funnier if you've had any sort of involvement with psychic phenomena or got swept up in any sort of New Age spirituality, but even if you don't get the ""psychic"" humor, the script is great, the comedic timing is impeccable, and the cast is completely delightful.  (For example, psychic Lauper letting her spirit guide work through her tells one of the bad guys, ""Your [dead] mother wants you to let us go, Ingo.""  Immediately, Falk adds, ""And she wants you to give us all your money.""  This was one of my all-time favorite Peter Falk vehicles, and I thought Lauper was charming and had great on-screen chemistry with Goldblum.  Really, what was not to like here",0
"People should face the facts: BHS hit their creative peak in the 80s with ""Locust Abortion"" and ""Rembrandt Pussyhorse"". It's a miracle none of them died of a drug overdose or wound up comatose vegetables and you can only run as fast and as hard as they did for so long before you tire out. It's unrealistic to expect a band as groundbreaking as BHS to keep breaking new ground again and again and again.  with ""Weird Revolution"" they were trying something new and I respect them for that. So what if this doesn't have the scary, nightmare vibe of their early stuff. I wish it did too, believe me. But I think that was a product of the chaotic, drug-induced flavor of the band at that time, and the guys are middle-aged now. Leary is mostly producing and the BHS went through years of exhausting lawsuits. You can't expect them to do the carnival-style concerts and Gibbytronix stuff forever. I really don't like techno at all, but I do like this CD a lot. It's got a feel to it. It's far and away better than the wretched ""Electric Larryland"" and feels like it has the BHS stamp on it. The songs have a nice texture. Admittedly, the lyrics are silly in places, but lyrics have never been a BHS strong point. with their early stuff you usually could never even UNDERSTAND the lyrics because Gibby was mumbling them through a megaphone. This is good stuff and it has some real beauty and seems to represent a more mellowed out Surfer period. Some of the stuff is pleasingly weird even though the CD has no real menace to it. But I think the menace came from the Surfers being young and insane. They're not so young anymore.",0

"I personally consider this one of the best films ever made.While set in LA, it is not about LA.It is about how people not having as much control over their lives as they think they do. About how chance meetings of other people, if given a chance to flourish, can lead to personal growth in the most unexpected ways.The cast is fantastic, but the real stand-outs are Mary McDonnell and Mary-Louise Parker. (Laura Linney was also in the film, but was given too little screen time.)This is a movie about personal growth, with an almost mystical undertone - despite the potential horrors of ""living"" in LA.See it. Then buy it.",0
"My reading history in fantasy is somewhat limited. I began with Piers Anthony and his Xanth series, continued to Tolkien, Terry Brooks with the Shannara series, David Eddings with Belgariad/Mallorian series, Foster with the Spellsinger series, and other scattered works of authors I cannot recall.I dare to say, none compare to the exquisite balance kept within this story. Morevi is a tale of high adventure and epic romance that does not waver towards the edge of its paper confines...it lives beyond, and to me such a thought is happy indeed. I am caught between holding the story in my hands (which I suspect shall be read again and again), and anticipating the next in the series with a mixture of fear and elation. I feel the obsession taking hold, the want of escape and the fleeting moment of a child's imagination relieving my travel-weary adult mind. To feel the innocence again! It is the greatest effect an author can achieve, in my opinion. There are some elements to which this story rhymes with my life experience, so ever closer to this tale did my heart bind.For a book that rekindles your inner child with fantasy and high adventure...and still nurtures the tale of a love between two souls in such detail...You need look no further.",1

It has been one of my best tools for dealing with my grief. Thank you Julia for such beautiful thoughts. Thank you God, for such a talented writer",1
"Although young, they had the talent.  1983 was a very competitive year for black music and Michael Jackson, Prince, Kool & The Gang, and The Pointer Sisters were those no one can compete with.  New Edition (1980s version of Jackson 5) were climbing up there and proved it with thier classic bubble gum pop/soul hits.  I love the #1 R&B title track of course as well as the #25 R&B hit, ""Popcorn Love.""  Proper adolescent slow jams such as ""Is This The End"" and the album closer ""Jealous Girl"" were what sparked the album and I love the former's video.  I dug all the other tracks from the album except for the boring, ""I Gotta Have Your Lovin'"" and ""Ohh Baby.""  8 out of 10, but you can't win them all from boys ages 14-16.  Since this album/cd is still in print (unlike many other old school albums), This is a must purchase for any NE fan.  I'm glad I own this cd and their self title and Heartbreak of which these three are their best!",0
"As a powered hub this works well. I can't speak to its cooling power because I couldn't get my 17"" laptop to sit on it and not move. There are only two rubber feet on the top surface, at the back, so a large laptop will not rest securely on it and will slide all over at the front. After trying another cooler that was too small for a large notebook, I bought this one specifically because it said it worked with 17"" laptops. Not mine",0

It's not Pavement meets Beach Boys.  Those are better.  But it got stuck in my head.  There is an energy to it that reminds me of Arcade Fire (even if the music isn't quite the same).  Omaha, Manitoba, Insistor are the songs that stand out to me",0

"There are many guides to London. From what I can see there are two good general guidebooks. These are the Eyewitness Travel (DK) guide which is the one that I personally prefer or Lonely Planet (the present book). These two books are both just around 500 pages and both are tremendous efforts. They are well balanced guides with lots of photos, maps, history, etc. Both are clearly 5 star guides.I would rate both (and DK Eyewitness Travel and Lonely Planet) head and shoulders ahead of Frommers or similar books that are less well balanced, i.e.; fewer photos. Overall, the DK guide has better photos and visuals. In fact I am amazed every time I pick up and read that DK guide with the quality of the photos and technical detail. Those graphics make for a better souvenir so it gets the nod as the better book, but it is a close call.The city has lots of fun things to see and do but time is usually limited and it is expensive - so these guides are good investments. This book is well balanced and like the DK guide it pulls a lot of things together such as history and culture, food, towns and lots of interesting information on London. The book brings it all to life with just magnificent photos and maps, including subway maps.I have one suggestion, and that is to buy the guide before planning your trip. The guide has lots of information and tips on places to see.Either case this is an excellent buy. 5 stars",1
"...not to mention scouts, indians, showmen, shootists, etc. I can't say enough good things about this book, or any other book by R.L. Wilson.

"I have been a big fan of Tosca as well as the Kruder and Dorfmeister team for years.  The double CD set Sessions by K&D is the best downtempo collection ever, IMHO.  I was very excited to learn recently that there was a Tosca CD (Souvenirs) about which I didn't know, so when I sat down to give it a serious listen with my headphones, I found myself extremely confused and disappointed.  I did not understand this experiment.  I found it to be so irritating that it broke my heart.  I understand the need for artists to reach out and explore new directions, but not here.  Not Tosca.  I hope they go back to what they do best-- minimalist, deep, sexy grooves.",0

"This book reminded me of the great Christian classic by Bunyan The Pilgrim's Progress.  Armed only with the scroll (the Word of God), this young squire must slay the dragon and rescue the lantern for his kingdom.  The scroll is the light for his path, his sword to slay the dragon, and the tool to see clearly in the darkest of times.  While others pursued the treasures of this world, the young squire held fast to the treasure of God's Word and was victorious in his quest.  The book is based on one of my favorite verses in Scripture, Psalm 119:9, ""How can a young man keep his way pure?  By living according to your Word.""  Highly recommended, especially for young elementary aged boys",1
"Highly recommended. Abrupt, in geologic time, to say the least. Check it out on the web",1

This story could be pulled from the newspaper of any of our large city papers today.  The author has a true wit about his writing that is appealing to both  young and old.  The art work is great and fits quite well with the text.  Recommend this one quite highly.",1

"This collection consists of three novels -- &quot;Vandover and the Brute,&quot; &quot;McTeague,&quot; and &quot;The Octopus&quot; -- and a series of essays.The novels are all grim, compelling stories. Another reviewer's remarking on the similarity between &quot;The Octopus&quot; and Zola's &quot;Germinal&quot; is apt. Unlike that reviewer, I found &quot;The Octopus&quot; most compelling. This is a grand tale with numerous subplots. The central theme is the struggle between the railroad (the octopus) and wheat farmers. I found it difficult to put down. And I found myself tearing up at points, somewhat disconcerting as I read most of this on BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit). All three novels are set in California with a least some if not most of the action taking place in San Francisco. These stories are excellent reads if you're not too squeamish",1

"This book focuses on industrial hazards, with brief explanations, and reasonably complete histories, of the industrial processes insofar as the history and the knowledge of the process can inform knowledge of the hazard presented to workers and to product users. One key theme is how knowledge of many of today's industrial hazards has been with us for very long periods of time, but that--and I interject here my own view--given the emphasis on economic development concurent with the rise of industrial society--medical and regulatory efforts at controlling or reducing the risks of the hazards have been unsuccessful, due to the inconvenence or costs to the industries so associated. Without actually using the term ""externalities,"" a propensity to assign those costs from industries to their employees, the environment, and to product-users is documented.Another key theme is that the knowledge of the hazards and their tentatively arrived-at mitigation measures has ebbed and flowed, with populations thinking that effective controls have been implemented when in fact they have not been.A further point of knowledge is that there is no clear dividing line between exposures in the workplace and exposures in the home. For this reason, and probably because the medical literature from which he is able to draw has dealt more with workplace hazards than with hazards in the home, the focus is on industry, though the writing moves from industry to the home when the hazards move there also. I would recommend the book to a popular audience for knowledge of industrial hazards in the home, but only if the reader is willing to learn the author's lessons regarding how the danger origininates in industry and moves from there to the home, and is willing to also learn the important lesson that the hazards to the workers who produce the products are significant factors in making product choices, as well as the actual toxic effect to the user. He quotes Jerry Garcia on the hellish aspects of vinyl record production. No special knowledge of chemistry is required to understand the text.Unfortunately I do not have the book in front of me now, but from memory, here are a few of the topics covered:- mercury fumes- cotton dust- carbon disulfide- chlorine- metal working fumes- multiple causes of ParkinsonismI do not mean to imply that the author appeared to me to be less than comprehensive in his addressing of toxic processes and products, although he did not deal extensively with military industries, nor with the current issue regarding the environmental distribution of uranium munitions. He touched on the shortcomings of the regulatory process under lassiz-faire capitalism, and sees the two most important upcoming issues, besides recovering from recent efforts at governmental deregulation and disassembling and hampering of regulatory agencies, as the toxic effects of additives to gasoline, and the toxic effects of wood preservation chemicals, both of which are throughly reviewed, noting the special dangers to children.I enjoyed his end-noted documentantion of the most obscure points of his historical reviews, some of which were not even central to what he was saying. I felt he liked doing this sort of extensive research, was expert in his field, and that the writing was a labour of love",1

"This book is a treasure of insights and connections which counterpoints the usual and self serving version of history told through the citation of famous people, famous places, and famous things. I was looking for for connections between the Leveller's Agreement of the People and the specifics of the US Constitution, between which stands approximatley 150 years. This book assisted my understanding of the linkages and dismissed many popularly presumed disconnections. The Many Headed Hydra in effect tells the stories of the common people, slaves, sailors, and exiled agitators for democracy and how the resistance to corporate and despotic governance was carried on through to the non violent seizure of the means of governance in rural Massachusetts by the farmers in 1774. It is really no wonder why this book won the the International Labor History Award. This book does not favor preconceived assumptions of the nature and history of democracy, nor of the posturing imposed as the official version of the history of the America or the United States. This stories within this book include resistance to the privatization of common lands in England, as well as to the usurptation of lands within the American continents, slavery in its several forms including impressment and chattel, the beginning of global imperialism as we know it today, and the establishment of maroon societies. Any education about current global events and issues is incomplete without the knowledge of the historical perspective and background reflected in The Many-Headed Hydra. Each chapter could easily be expanded into a separate book. It is an excellent piece of collaboration and scholarshi",1
This is the album that secured his spot among the most important songwriters of the 70s. A classic for sure,0
"Dr. Brose's &quot;Guide to EKG Interpretation&quot; is a resource that all physicians in training should seriously consider acquiring.  It is an extremely thorough book, and its size is deceptive.  You wouldn't think a small pocket-size book could pack this much information!  As an illustration, I had a question on my Part II board exam about a &quot;J wave&quot;, something I had never heard of, even after my EKG rotation and delivering a few EKG lectures.  As it turns out, Dr. Brose's book addresses the J wave, while many other resources make no mention of it.  Also, the material is presented in a way that is clear and very easy to follow.  Full of cross-references, you can quickly gain a solid understanding of virtually any issue you'll encounter when interpreting an EKG.  I believe that medical students, interns, residents, and attending physicians alike will benefit from owning this book.  Certainly, it is something that medical students and interns should have in their pockets (it is not cumbersome...it's a perfect size)",1
"This is a badly written book due to the attempt of using Ivy League elucidations for topics that should be told straightforward in terms of simple language. It also doesn't help to use end-of-the-book topics as examples or part of discussions in the early part of the book. In the end, this book causes more damage and confusion for someone attempting to learn the basic concepts of accounting for the first time. I'm embarrassed.",1
"Every single one of these wonderful songs was a huge hit on the pop charts in the 1970s or early 1980. Disco Inferno hung around the charts for months and set thousands of dancefloors alight, while the minimalist Funkytown caused quite a stir in 1980. YMCA featured in the movie of the same name and was one of Village people's greatest hits. Boogie Oogie Oogie went Billboard Top 5 in 1979. Good Times was one of the biggest hits of 1978 and spawned quite a cult following for Chic. A very intelligent compilation and a pleasure to listen to, also ideal for parties",0

"I find Nash fascinating and the book excellent. From what I read, I believe Nash was misdiagnosed. I believe his mental condition was Dissociative Identity Disorder rather than Paranoid Type of Schizophrenia. Both include components of auditory and visual hallucinations. I prefer the less-psychotic one over schizophrenia. I also believe his treatment was inappropriate.  However, the book and his life are heartwarming and present the human side of mental disorders",1
"We own ""Peek-a-Who"", ""Ready, Set, Go"" and ""Roberto, the Insect Architect"" also written by Laden, and we LOVE them all.  This one is just as good.  As we turn each page, our boys hopefully anticipate what creative and fun illustration they'll see next.  The books read so fluidly and easily that my little boys (1,3,5 yrs old) memorize the words and rhyme along with us as we read them.  We have given these books as gifts every year for Christmas and birthdays and the recipients have equally enjoyed them.  I typically recycle books(out with the old and in with the new) but these are in our collection to stay",1

"I have read almost all the books in this series as well as several others on the topic Mr. Weiss has written. They are all excellent!  Contrary to another reviewer this book is not a rehash of other material.  This book is incredible in telling consultants how to track down and land new clients, which is the life blood of any consulting practice.I loved the section on overcoming objections.  In my practice I have run into some of these objections as well as others and never had a good answer for them.  Now I do.  The material in this book changed my consulting sales in the one year since I started implementing the ideas and revenue has doubled in that same year.If you are a consultant and have ever struggled with over coming objections, searching for new clients, or landing new business then you need to read this book",1

"Houses of the Holy didn't start Led Zeppelin's fascination with Tolkien-like imagry, but it sure had been perfected by the release of this wonderful album. From the beginning to the end, it plays like a sunset streaking across the sky. Rocking songs mix with slower ballads and make a work of art that is as close to perfection that music can be. While 'Houses' may not contain as many singles as Led Zeppelin IV it makes up for it in it's long, sweeping epics and poetic, mystical lyrics. A classic in every sense of the word; a must own for any true rock fan",0
"9/11: Press For Truth is one of the best documentaries made on this topic. Paul Thomspson the most thorough, honest, and brilliant political researchers in the United States together with the widows of 9/11 have done a wonderful job putting together this touching and truthful documentary that would reverberate deeply in every viewer's psyche. Although their voices have been unheard and silenced,this DVD will carry on the torch of truth forever. Buy it, watch it, and pass it around so the voices of truth are heard everywhere.",0
"Excellent musicianship, sound and video production...... wwwwoooooowwww.....I was blown away. Highly entertaining, and with a great song selection. The additional features are a bit on the poor side, specially missing a documentary as special features (bad habit from the DT DVDs), just to get to know the band a bit better. But the main feature compensates, 'cause it would be a 5 star even if it didn't bring any additionals. After seeing this, it makes me think it's worth travelling to another country to see them live.",0
"Being a fledgling opponent of strong AI, I picked up this book hoping to learn the weaknesses of the strong AI argument. Alas, this was the wrong book to pick up.I am not even sure what Penrose's main argument is; of course it may be there but was lost in the 450 pages of mostly irrelevant details on physics. To say in the least, his attack is not coherent or well structured. He seems to admit that his position is very vulnerable himself: he constantly admits to mere speculation and weakness of evidence on his part. If he abridged this book to may 100 or 200 pages, it may have been more effective. When I was half way through, I nearly quit reading because I could tell he was going nowhere, but I figured if I had already wasted this much time, I might was well finish it. I regret that decision now. TENM may be just another example of a grandiose physicist touting an interesting subject like modern physics as accessible to the layman. If it is accessible, Penrose is not the one to do it. There seems to be a market for these pop physics books (i.e. Elegant Universe) because yuppies out there want a feeling of wonderment about things they don't understand. How much they actually get from these  books questionable. In the end, Penrose somehow wants to say that modern physics presents an obstacle for strong AI. I hope there are books out there that actually might show this",1
"Until now, Fortune Rocks was my favorite Anita Shreve book, but it has just been exceeded by A Wedding in December. The storyline of a high school clique who went their separate ways after gradution and are reuniting 27 years later for a wedding is highly appealing because I could personally relate to it. The characters were approximately the same age and facing the same midlife crisises as me. I saw parts of myself and my own struggles in each of them, particularly Agnes. I loved the setting, a classy country inn owned by one of the main characters located in Massachusetts Birkshire Mountains. Anita Shreve's brilliant writing style and attention to detail prevailed throughout. This book had very high expectations and it didn't disappoint! I highly recommend it to all, but mostly especially to women in their 40's.",1
"I don't live in a Craftsman bungalow, but I'm adding a number of Craftsman details to my existing NW cabin style house. Over the years I have collected numerous books full of photographs of various bungalows but I have sold all of them now that I have this book. This one book contains information on nearly every exterior detail you are likely to need, and is lavishly illustrated with photographs and drawings. It's an excellent reference for buffs and restorers. I have already pre-ordered the next volume which will cover interiors. Shame I have to wait 6 months",1
I am a beginner and believe me this book was not for me.  If I only wanted to develop a tic tac toe game program then this book would be for me.  It covers beginning topics but barely scratches the surface.  It was useless for the applications I was wanting to learn and didn't even mention most of them.  Spend a little more money and get a book that is about 20x thicker so you actually have the info necessary to complete a project,1
"I held off getting this book because it was my (false) impression that the defense of the charismatic position had no biblical backing.  I also trusted that Hanegraaff and MacArthur's caricatures of charismatics were the norm.  It had not yet occurred to me that the case for biblical charismata has both biblical and historical evidence on its side.  The Apostle Paul criticized the Corinthians for spiritual pride and lack of order but he never dismissed the manifestations as false nor did he tell them to cease pursuing them.  DeArteaga quite capably states that the burden of proof lies with the opponents of the charismata to prove that the gifts are no longer active.  In Quenching The Spirit, the author makes the case that charismatic critics have yielded to the spirit of the Pharisees time and time again throughout church history, repeatedly denying, allegorizing or explaining away tons of scriptures as well as ignoring various historical outbreaks of revival simply because they could not control living stones!This is one thorough scholarly defense, and is written with a peaceful pastoral heart and a love for the brethren which once again is in line with the biblical spirit.  I would dock him half a star for calling Kenneth Copeland's take on Jesus as a god-man as ""completetly orthodox"" because in the same sermon Copeland says Jesus had to be a god-man ""just like the first one"" (Adam), but I honestly believe it was a simple oversight on DeArteaga's part since he quotes the whole section anyway so anyone can read it for themselves.DeArteaga's credentials (and extensive notes section) prove you don't have to commit intellectual suicide in becoming charismatic.  He even gives quantum physics a moderate tackle in one chapter, correlating it with an idealistic view of faith.  He neither brushes off excesses nor errors, but they are dealt with a kind apologetic.  As are the critics of the movement I should add which is probably more than their judgemental rants deserve.  See the sympathetic chapter devoted to critic Dave Hunt's life.  There are no straw men nor is there any name-calling in this book. BTW, another plus:  it has thick paper so your highlighter won't bleed through the pages when making notes!",1

"Golden Country is terrific--a definite must.  Gilmore is a wonderful writer with an amazing ability to develop such strong characters and images in the book that they live with you even after you've finished the book.  There's the dazzle of broadway; the rawness of Jewish mafia; and the toughness of immigrant survival.  Gilmore's ""golden"" touch is to develop ironies about the American dream through such unforgetable, fascinating characters.  It's a classic, not to be missed.",1
"I have been following Laura since her first album.  We are about the same age, and I feel as though I have grown with her.  Her music continues to mature and take on new shape, while still maintaining the heartfelt emotion behind every song.  My favorite song from this album is &quot;Jenny&quot;.  It is both whimsical and haunting.  Laura's music really grabs at you from within, and I think she has succeeded in continuing that magic throughout the years.  As a true Laura fan, I have not been disappointed yet",0
"I've learned so much from this book, it's unbelievable.  I had no idea what was needed to get published, and was just blithely going along writing because I like to.  I had no great thoughts of going any further with it, but a week ago at a Writer's Conference I pitched my idea to an agent, just because she was there.  She asked for a proposal and samples!!I had no idea how to go about a proposal, but I did have this little yellow book (Author 101 - Bestselling Book Proposals) I had bought several months ago at the suggestion of a fellow member of a Writer's Group.  It was still sitting where I put it that night so long ago - lucky I even found it, as disorganized as I am.)Since our Writing group wasn't to meet for another two weeks, I couldn't wait to ask for help, so drug out the book ... what a total joy to find this little thing, filled chock-ful of ideas, suggestions and samples.I'm about half-way through with the proposal (book's already written ... as well as two sequels) and will present it to my group for critiques.I'm in love with this book!  Thank you so much, Rick and Robyn!(I gave this book 5 stars, but when it showed up in my preview it showed as only 1)",1

"After reading ""Ping,"" it is apparent that Stuart Avery Gold's work stands tall amidst the current crop of success strategy writers. It's such a pleasure to read Gold's singularly important voice. This book is a quick read, but the thoughts and morals of its story can serve the success hungry dreamer for a lifetime. I'm so very happy that I've read it.The story is about ""Ping,"" one of nature's most inelegant creatures -- a lowly pond frog. But Ping's natural ability to jump and leap is unrivaled amongst his fellow ponders. Until one day his environment changes dramatically -- the pond begins to dry up. And Ping's leaping talents are compromised. What should he do? Continue to stay where he's grown comfortable, in the now thickening mud? Or should he venture boldly forth, to find a place where his talents can once again be used and where he can undoubtedly be happier?How Ping manages to break free from his stagnant prison of sameness and inertia and search out a better life is truly inspiring. The challenges that the little frog faces and the lessons that he learns are inherent in any successful life journey. And at 128 pages, Gold's impressive economy of words and his inimitable writing style is so potent and long-lasting that no one who reads it can be unaffected.Stuart Avery Gold is an original philosopher. If you really are intent on changing your life for the better -- buy, read, and learn from this book",1

"Buying this book is a no-brainer. If you are an entrepreneur (without a marketing background), as I am, this book will completely change how you position your company, craft your sales message, develop website content, and explain what you do.If you are developing a new product or service it is often hard to communicate the value of your offering: you get so caught up in features that you have a hard time explaining the benefits. Customers could care less about features, the want to know ""what will it do for me?"" This book sets you down the right path.Simply put, it is THE most important business book I have ever read. If I could only choose one more business book to read for the rest of my life, I would read this one again",1
"I'm with the previous reviewer, did the amazon reviewer actually listen to this?This a fantastic record. It stands strongly with the other two mentioned.I tracked it down for myself on cassette in the early 90's, the finally got it on vinyl - now CD. I gets better and better, upon repeated listenings, it is satisfying on so many levels - there is a real unfolding emotional intensity in this album.Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye were on totally different orbits, just listen to any of their other works for comparison. In my opinion Mayfield, whilst catchy, went the route of James Brown for soundtracks i.e. did their usual stuff, but for soundtrack.Soundtracks are all about incidental music too, you know! Gaye created atmosphere",0

When I was able to get the suctions to finally stick, as soon as my son would touch it, it would bend right above the suction part and it would end up in his face.  They should have added some kids of reinforcemnt so that it could stand upright all the time. I took this back the next day. I bought the Sassy Fascination Station instead.  It has a giant suction at the bottom and serves its purpose, even I had a hard time pulling it off the tray.",0
"  This one is my favorite out of Sade's work.  While the philosophy incorperated here is not all that different from what we learn in Justine, it really gives us a look at things from the handled end of the cat-o-nine tails.    Here we get to follow Juliette, Justine's more fortunate sister, throughout her years as she wins, loses, wins and loses only to win more and more.  This book was meant to illustrate the advantages of vice, while Justine was more along the lines of portraying the disadvantages of virtue.  While we don't really learn anything new here, it makes a good free-reading book, which gets 5 stars as it is best read with one hand.",1

"I've had this LCD TV in my house for a few weeks now and I am very happy with the quality of the picture, size and design.  Best way to break this down into a short review would be to list the pros and cons:PROS: nice design; wonderful picture for HD signal and DVDs; sturdy stand; plenty of inputsCONS: remote control is terrible, shocks me that Panasonic would make such a nice television and then engineer a remote that is just awful; no PC inputBeing new to the new flat screen TVs I am a little ignorant of why/how analog signals fit this widescreen TV, but they do and the picture doesn't seem stretched at all.  All in all I am very happy with this television and don't miss my bulky cathode ray tube.  This TV is perfect for a bedroom, office or anywhere a smaller TV can be used.  The only major downside is the atrocious remote control that comes with it, but that's not enough to take this down another star.***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDE",0

"How do we coherently integrate and mobilize our evolving consciousness, technology, outright madness, and pig-headed, luminous human potential? Worldchanging is not the formulative answer but it's the best step in the right direction I have seen so far. Worldchanging is a users guide and the starting point needed to begin millions (hopefully billions) of important conversations. It is filled with what we need most: straightforward, bite-sized summaries, directives and how-to instructions on most of the topics that we humans desperately need to know about in order to drive positive change. From under-reported successes in urban areas and environmental movements across the progressive spectrum to alternative energy solutions and simple facts and figures about the millennia we face, it carries the reader through the full intellectual and emotional spectrum. I read about 25% of it in the first sitting and finished it the following day. Its rare that I am inspired, educated and empowered with specific tools for action in one sitting. My head was spinning and my eyes hurting but my spirits were quite lifted. I couldn't believe how much I did NOT know about each of the subjects. And perhaps therein lies the essential value of Worldchanging: it equips ordinary individuals with information and resources to take immediate, meaningful and impacting action in their lives and on behalf of organizations.",1
"My almost-6 year old daughter was diagnosed with autism at age 2 and we took a multi-pronged approach, including things like supplements, a GFCF diet, and OT/PT/speech. After a year on the GFCF diet and many specialized supplements and no change in behaviors, we went back to a normal diet with standard vitamin supplements and continued her behavioral therapies. Our close friends' daughter, now age 4 and also diagnosed with autism, took a similar approach, but even more strict, following the DAN protocol as well as the recommendations of this book, including chelation, a dizzying array of supplements, GFCF diet, OT/PT/Speech, ABA, etc. While our child has made tremenous advances, or friends' child has not, beyond minor advances related to her age--at 4, she is still non-verbal, far from potty trained, exhibits many repetitive behaviors, and needs constant verbal and visual cues for the simplest tasks. The point I am trying to make is that every child is different and no one, NO ONE has shown that one course of therapy cures or even convincingly improves a significant percentage of children with autism. Autism, as most of you likely know well, is a catch-all term. Our friends' daughter no doubt has a very different kind of pathology than ours. I have yet to really see a book or study address that fact first and foremost before offering a course of action, rather than immediately launching into predictions of one ""cure"" for a broad range of issues. While I do think some of what the author recommends can be helpful (and it really may offer a tremendous help for some children with autism), some of the therapies (like chelation) can be very dangerous--in fact, I have yet to see one of the many families who tried chelation therapy see *any* improvement in their child's symptoms. I have seen more success with GFCF diets (for a small percentage of children), but the greatest success seems to come with comprehensive behavioral therapy. I certainly understand where families are coming from--I have been there myself, but treating your child like a guinea pig and attempting to ""cure"" them with multiple substances that have had very little study/peer review in a desperate frenzy of worry is both dangerous to their bodies and destructive to their emotions. As with anything, balance is your approach will serve you and your child well.",1

"K.C. Cole has the rare ability to make the physical world both comprehensible and entertaining. I never thought I'd curl up with a good physics book but I found her brief commentaries obliterate the usual arbitrary separation between science and the humanities. In fact, it is by making physics so humanistic that she makes it clear to those of us who have difficulties understanding numerical concepts or apparently obscure ideas like space-time, quarks, and black holes. &quot;Physics is simple,&quot; she writes, &quot;. . . .consider the harmonics of a bottle of beer. Blow over the top, and you can make a series of different sounds, depending on how hard you blow and how much beer is left in the bottle. And lo and behold, it is by analyzing a very similar set of harmonics set up by the sloshing of gas and light in the early universe that astronomers have been able to put their ears to the cosmos, listening in on its babblings from the first moment of time. And here's what Cole, the mistress of metaphor, has to say about how Einstein's theory of relativity explains gravity as a curvature of space-time: &quot;It's like an elephant sitting on a waterbed. Heavy objects bend space-time into &quot;gravity wells&quot; that pull other object in.&quot; If Einstein had put it that way in the first place, I wouldn't have had to wait this long to get it.

No disappointments here but remember the old shows done in the late 50's and early 60's aren't up to par technologically with the later shows.  Still it's a welcome set to those who have been searching for those VHS tapes of Dodger World Series Championships.Go Blue",0
"The author is clearly a seasoned songwriter with an abundance of knowledge and skill.  Yet, he is able to explain the technicalities of songwriting in such a way that the not-so-professional hobbyist songwriter like myself can  follow.  Having not had formal music theory training myself I could easily  catch up with the essentials without feeling it was a hopeless situation.   The author  managed to keep my attention and deal with the music theory in  such a fashion that I could not wait to see his next topic.  I found the  approach very practical.  In fact, I could immediately apply what I learned  and the results were immediate.  Still, an enormous amount of information  is contained in this book and I am sure I shall refer back to the detail  many times in the future.  It has also helped me better understand songs  that already became hits and the book is full of real examples",1
"This is a long book, maybe one of the longest London wrote, but no matter, you can take it in small doses, because the book is a straight narrative with no suspense, no drama, only London's wishful fantasy working overtime.  No matter the obstacle, and London lays them on with heavy-handed doses of pessimism, the lily-white hero and heroine, Billy and Saxon, easily overcome each while giving the author plenty of opportunity to express his famous prejudice against all non-Anglo Saxons.  London also builds his case for scientific farming, sustainability, as a method that will win out every time.  While in truth, London was an abject failure at farming with every experiement ending in disaster.  The tale is sugar coated fantasy, London  dreaming his couple into everlasting happiness.  The coincidence at the end is not to be believed.  It's pure sap written in the twilight of his career when his talents appear on the wane.  It's the only London book I have read to date that I would not recommend on any level",1

"The oneiric quality of Millhauser's prose reminds me that of such masters as Neil Gaiman,Ray Bradbury and Lord Dunsany.His poetic, poignant and disturbing short stories are carefully crafted little gems with a fantastical bent that frequently exude a sense of otherworldliness and evoke feelings of melancholy and dread. There's a poetic beauty in Millhauser's prose unmatched by any conteporary writerThis collection is a fine display of Millhauser's talent and shouldn't be missed.7 * The Knife Thrower ================== ***** 25 * A Visit =========================== **1/2 45 * The Sisterhood of Night =========== ****** 63 * The Way Out ======================= ****1/289 * Flying Carpets ==================== ****103 * The New Automaton Theater ======== *****129 * Clair de Lune ==================== *** 143 * The Dream of the Consortium ====== *****165 * Balloon Flight, 1870 ============= 181 * Paradise Park ==================== *** 225 * Kaspar Hauser Speaks ============= ****1/2237 * Beneath the Cellars of Our Town == ****",1
"Palette of different tastes as if evoked by a selection of French cheeses...  What better way to sample French authors (from Honore de Balzac and Zola to Gavalda and Beigbeder) than to read Constantine's fairy tales!  A Paris enthusiast will appreciate the images, scents and reminiscences recreated by the stories.  Quartier by quartier, arrondissement by arrondissement, various writers take the reader on a tour of the City of Light; a tour which is part historic, part contemporary and quite sensual.  I close my eyes and for a second and I am transplanted from the suburbs of New York to Paris.  Memories from half a dozen trips to the sacred place conjure up.

"After 30 years of doing &quot;other things&quot; I decided to refresh my knowledge of electrical principles learned in the military.  This book is excellent because it starts at the very beginning and builds, one concept on another, with ample photos and illustrations, to allow you to truly understand what you are reading.  If you want to learn about electricity and don't want to go take a course to do it, this is the book...even if you don't know anything at all about the subject",1
"Jane Yolen's &quot;Commander Toad&quot; series is a charming science fiction spoof, and an excellent children's book.  The detailed, zany illustrations by Bruce Degen are the perfect complement to the witty text  and off-the-wall characters.  The test of any children's book is its  reception by actual children, and &quot;Commander Toad and the Space  Pirates&quot; gets full marks there. It has been requested so many times by  my 5- and 3- year-old siblings that I can now recite it from memory.  The  text stands the test of many repetitions, and my five year old brother,  just now learning to write, can often be heard to request &quot;Mom, how do  you spell 'Commander Toad'? How do you spell 'Space Pirates?'",1

"This is a terrible excuse for a guidebook.  Its maps are blatantly incorrect: the subway map is a ballpark approximation, at best, and things in Central Park are not located where the map says they are, among others.  Its attraction descriptions neglect crucial information about the details you actually need at the sites (the Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty in particular), and the restaurant descriptions do not show the complete picture.  I don't throw out books I dislike, but this one is going straight to the recycling bin",1
"As a major fan of Vaughn Monroe, I was very pleased with &quot;The Very Best of Vaughn Monroe&quot;. I found the remastering excellent and the selection of songs to be a good representation Vaughn's recordings. One  problem I did find with this collection is that the represented version of  &quot;Racing with the Moon&quot; is not the original 1941 version rather a  1945 re-recording with strings. The 1941 version seems to never be  re-issued and I would like to have had it represented with Vaughn's early  songs on this CD. I have all of these recordings on either 45's or 78's and  for the first time I have discovered how wonderful the Vaughn Monroe  Orchestra really was without all of the surface noise included on the  original 78's.Vaughn Monroe was a huge star from the Big Band Era well into  the early Rock years,who could forget Vaughn's Twist version of Bye, Bye,  Blackbird? It is really sad that Vaughn has so little to represent him on  CD. Hopefully we will see more recordings appear with the same quality as  this CD",0
"Not everyone wants to be a practicing magician, but everyone needs to bring a little magic into their lives.  None of us makes a pretension to be as captivating as a professional magician or Las Vegas showman, but we are all captivated by these people and wish that we could harvest some of their charismatic power for our personal and business lives.  Wouldn't you like to learn how a magician can focus his eyes on you, so that you become mesmerized by his gaze and feel that you must follow each one of his moves?  Wouldn't you like to learn how a Las Vegas showman gives ""presence"" to his human frame - sometimes despite his actual size - and ""fills"" the room with his personality?  Have you ever wondered how a magician gets you to focus on one part of his body, while another part of his body is actually putting the trick together?What Steve Cohen conveys to you is that these are simple techniques, but they require almost daily practice.  Steve talks about ""eye contact"" drills you can perform while you're walking through the mall, ""posture"" drills you can practice before your next big presentation, and ""misdirection"" techniques that, somewhat contradictorily, actually help focus your audience's attention on you.  You can read books about public speaking, which all repeat the same mantras about ""eye contact,"" ""breathing,"" and ""body language,"" or you can take Steve's unorthodox approach to give your speeches a little ""magic.""Steve's book is extremely well-written, and very entertaining.  A little bit of talk about ""magic,"" but nothing that would make a non-practitioner's eyes glaze over.",1

"I asked Santa for this book.If I've been good this will be the third copy I've owened or possessed I should say, the first was on loan from a retired bosuns mate, I was hopping after a year or so he'd forget, he didn't.

I can still turn a three strand turks head from memory and throw a half dozen bowlines but I miss my old friend especially the multistrand braids and tatting.The book is a wealth of information, sometimes it can be difficult to follow but after you under thier style of instruction it falls into place and goes pretty easy.I've only found a couple knots not covered but if I look hard enough and long enough I would find it's varient or it's great grandfather.

"I can not remember my first kiss, but I do remember the first time I heard the voice of Nancy Wilson. After listening to Nancy it reminded me how to love again. See Nancy's voice tells a story. A story of love lost, love found and love nutured and then given to you as a gift.R.S.V.P. is that beautiful epic of love. With this added gem to Nancy's vast catalogue it is apparent why she is the legend with the golden voice, not to mention a true lady! The album starts with, ""An older man is like an elegant wine"", A wonderful song about the sophistication and maturity of what an older man brings to a relationship. Nancy's lush approach to this lyric paints the picture of actually having dinner with the older genteleman she is singing about.The second track,""Day in Day Out"", demonstrates Nancy's can still swing with the best of them! The next song , ""Why did I choose you"" a Marvin Gaye tune that when orginally released gained little exposure , is a duet with R&B sensation Kenny Lattimore. Nancy and Kenny's voices are such a wonderful blend of elegance, love and sophistication, one might believe that Kenny and Nancy are really in love. There are host of other beautiful ballads, but pay special attention to the tracks,""Goodbye"" and ""Minds of their own"". If you have ever loved before and wondered why things did not quite turn out the way you expected, Nancy has the answer. I am honored and humbled to have heard all theses beautiful songs in the last several months in person with the great lady of song and wish for all who have ever appreciated good music to take a page from the Nancy Wilson songbook and enjoy!Nancy thank you for the answer!",0

"This book, in its second version, includes case studies of 15+ archaeological tragedies. The author and contributing experts document the history of the diaspora of archaeological artifacts from their provenances, the use of these articles in nationalistic and religious contexts, and the  struggle for repatriation. This is an excellent book for any archaeologist  as it reminds us of the modern context of our work. In addition, students  of art history, law, anthropology, and history will find the book useful in  its breadth of coverage.

"Biopics, as a rule, so oversimplify and sentimentalize their subjects that it's rare to find one that presents a plausible picture of a life actually lived. To have lived such a brief life, as young Basquiat did, may seem to come to the aid of the 90-minute filmmaker, but that this story of a brilliant New York street artist comes across as believable at all is a testament to the performances, the script, and the direction. The only thing really missing in this film is an appreciation of Basquiat's works themselves. Maybe you leave that for the Learning Channel.Jeffrey Wright is just fine as the troubled and gifted artist who became an overnight sensation in the New York art world and then, according to writer/director Julian Schnabel (who should know) was more or less eaten alive by it. And he holds his own with a supporting cast of notables including Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Parker Posey, Benicio del Toro, and others, including David Bowie as a wonderfully sympathetic Andy Warhol. While you may take exception to the accuracy of the film, you find yourself accepting it as a portrayal of a certain kind of life that has been regarded from the beginning as larger than life - and any resemblance to Van Gogh is intended from the start. The richly varied music track, including snatches of Miles' Davis' ""Kind of Blue,"" is also wonderful",0

"This book pulls a lot of threads together, unifying the Robot stories and the Foundation stories to a far greater extent than the innuendo of Foundations Edge. Hari Seldon at last becomes a person with hopes and failings; We see his relationship with Robots, including our old freind R. Daneel Olivaw and finally we see how the first and second foundations came to be through a set of circumstances that has plot twists that only the master himself could have envisaged.As his final work, the epilogue leaves one almost certain that Asimov had known of his imminent death and had left a message for his readers in the words of Hari Seldon who many consider to be his alter-ego.Whatever your views on the more esoteric subjects you'll find that this book is executed in the same inimitable style as The Caves Of Steel, showing that Asimov never lost his touch over all the years of his tenure as the true master of science fiction.",1

"This film is light and fun, well acted and knows what it is.  A film that doesn't take itself seriously yet does present a convincing love story in a beautiful setting with a fun take on an historical figure.And I might only give it 4 stars, but it gets the extra star for showcasing the beauty of... New Jersey.  My home state gets a bad rap, and this film shows just how lovely much of the state truly is.  While it's meant to take place in the 50s, the scenery is still there and still beautiful.Oh, and one other thing that makes it a five...  As a man, this is one of those ""chick films"" that I'll gladly watch with my girlfriend.  It's Meg Ryan at her cutest, and Tim Robbins is weird enough looking that I look pretty good in comparison. This movie helps perpetuate the myth that goofy looking guys without much to offer can attract smart, attractive women, and hey, what's wrong with that? ;",0
"I simply could not put this book down. I wished it would last for 1,000 pages. But, both during and after, I thought to myself, can it be really true? How much of it is fabrication based upon just minimal evidence? Well, it seems that in Shakespeare scholarship, minimal evidence defines the elusive terrain. I accept that there will always be an element of subjectivity.In this context, to me the first test is the test of reasonable plausability. I had known some of the facts of Shakespeare's life. I knew that his dad was Bailiff of Stratford-on-Avon. But I did not know that it entailed contracting bands of players to perform morality plays...plays which were the media events of their era. To me, it is plausable that the young Will would have been exposed through them to the experience of theater....and plausable also, their effect on a highly attentive young mind.The aesthetic evolution of Will was a second plausability test. In his plays, he was fully able to poke fun at the common people, while also displaying a kind of duality towards them from the sophisticated perpective of nobility. Greenblatt employs the plays themseves to sift attitudes. The key attitude here, as in ""A Mid-Summer Night's Dream"", is that Will skillfully finds a way to give a subtle preferential affirmation to the former, even over the latter. He exposes the special charm of the play's whole conceit.How could this extraordinary ability have evolved? From the rote learning of his schoolboy Latin immersion, to the crude directness of the morality plays, to the traditional nature festivals, Will's exposure to the lively imagination of his commoner culture, in all its joys and foibles, is convincing. Less provable, was his proposed exposure to higher education and theater, through his mother's noble Arden relatives.....and a sparse written clue of inheritance of the actor's costume, upon which Greenblatt's thesis hangs. All I can say is that, as ablely presented, it seems quite believeable. The fact that Greenblatt is laboring a bit here, did not disturb me, for I fully expected any thesis would have its challenges. And finally, the wonderful chapter on the ""Dream of Resotration"", a key theme in many of Will's plays, has very clear parallels to the precipitous decline of his father's fortunes.....a documented truth, that must have had signficant impact on Will's life view. Will's dad, a Greenblatt elicited Fallstaffian character, falls from grace; falls from prominence in real life, with real consequences for the young Shakespeare.Throughout, Greenblatt employs the scant facts we know, and the expressions Will artfully presented, with his own kind of mature humanist imagination, to precipitate the emotions that plausably might have driven the actions and decisions of Shakespeare and the real people in his life. That Shakespeare of all people, would have been keeenly rooted to these, to me, is absolutely beyond doubt. Greenblatt's assumption of this vision is certainly not flawless, as it is subject to its own contemporary set of values and assumptions, but as a comprehensive logical construction, it's the most compelling vision of the person of Shakespeare, that I have so far read",1
"Excellent text.  Contains nice, brief summaries of matlab functionality, with references on where to go to get more verbose explanations.  This book is about the size of a postcard.  When I need to locate or discover a new function that I'm sure matlab has somewhere,  this Primer is usually more effective than the matlab on-line help.  Also good for an overview of functionality, an area where Matlab's on-line help is particularly weak.  Assumes no knowledge of matlab",1
"Audie Murphy excels in this low-key suspenseful western. His portrayal of [...] John Gant is one of his finest roles: stoic, pragmatic and cooly emotionless, yet not without humor and even a soft side. Those who like Audie Murphy westerns will enjoy this movie.The rest of the cast is great, and the suspense created by the characters not knowing which town citizen will be Murphy's victim is truly nail-biting. The over reactions and false conclusions of those who feel they will be the victim lead inevitably to tragic consequences.At a compact hour and seventeen minute run time, this movie is a lot of fun and doesn't waste any time getting right to the action. A forgotten western gem that has finally debuted on DVD.",0

"This brilliant ""true story of monstrous deception"" reads like a novel and is every bit as good as Truman Capote's IN COLD BLOOD and Norman Mailer's THE EXECUTIONER'S SONG. Emmanuel Carrere, ""one of France's most critically acclaimed writers,"" according to the jacket blurb, is such a good writer that if you aren't careful, you will be far more sympathetic than you ought to be toward Jean-Claude Romand who one day in January 1993 killed his wife and two children, then travelled to his aged parents' home and killed both of them and finally in a bungled suicide attempt-- or was it-- set his house on fire with him and his dead wife and children still in it. Mr. Carrere became fascinated with Romand's story, a correspondence between the two men ensued, and this book is the result.Mr. Carrere delves into how Mr. Romand got to the place where he felt there was no exit for him other than murder, his brilliant lies on top of lies over the years and why he managed to escape being found out for so long.Since France does not have capital punishment, Romand got life in prison for his crimes. Of course he, as do many inmates when faced with a long prison sentence, finds religion. To Mr. Carrere's everlasting credit he is not persuaded. ""He [Romand] is not putting on an act, of that I'm sure, but isn't the liar inside him putting one over on him? When Christ enters his heart, when the certainty of being loved in spite of everything makes tears of joy run down his cheeks, isn't it the adversary deceiving him yet again""?This is fine writing indeed.

"The scare-mongering review by Michelle McAllister is way off the mark, as is Erin's (but then she admits she hasn't read the book, so no surprises there). Sure ANYONE or THING could choke on a bone, but by and large, animals are used to a diet that involves chewing and gnawing, and the soft foods marketed by the commercial pet food industry come nowhere close. The plain truth is somehow, along the line, a massive industry has evolved to cater for our (not our pet's) every whim when it comes to feeding our so-called best friends. So-called, because if you knew what REALLY went into a can of dog food (visit www.purelypets.com/articles/whatsinfood.htm for an appraisal of what's in the average can) you'd never feed it to your best friend! Commercial pet food is a lazy alternative pressed upong us by mega corporations who have convinced us it is the best way to keep family pets healthy and happy. They make a massive income from companion animal ownership, and sacrificing precious consumer dollars to the local butcher is the LAST thing they want to happen.To the silly people who say raw meaty bones are not good for dogs or cats - I suppose you think these animals are vegetarians? And I suppose you would be personally happy to never eat a fresh meal again and switch to canned soup, spaghetti and baked beans instead? Educate yourselves and spare your pets the poor dental and general health they are no doubt suffering because of your ignorance. Give them a meaty bone!

"This book is a fine, well-illustration retrospective and current update on one of the pioneers of Op Art and the eternal power of geometry and the sensuality of the curve. Whether circle arrangements, stripe patterns, or lacing of mechanically drawn curves, Riley's paintings are a feast for the eyes.  But this is not simple geometric painting or familiar spatial illusions (as in the early years of Op).  There is a complexity that is yet peaceful.  The rich colors are joyful. Underappreciated in the United States, Riley's work can inspire a new look at the solid form",1

"Named for the mythical (?) and mystical kingdom in the East, Shambhala Publications is known for bringing some of the greatest and sometimes most obscure philosophical writings of Mankind to the attention of the general public. Heavily (though not exclusively) concerned with Buddhist and Taoist thought, Shambhala Pocket Classics are an attractive set of unabridged minibooks which fit comfortably in a shirt pocket, making them perfect for reading on planes, trains, and automobiles. Titles in the set include THE BOOK OF TEA, WAY OF THE JEWISH MYSTICS, ZEN FLESH, ZEN BONES, THE TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD, TAO TE CHING, POEMS BY EMILY DICKINSON, THE ART OF WAR, and this volume by Morihei Ueshiba, THE ART OF PEACE. Written as a conscious counterpoint to Sun Tzu's immortal classic, THE ART OF PEACE is a collection of aphorisms and short maxims which set forth Ueshiba's philosophy of life. Ueshiba (1883-1969), the founder of Aikido (""The Art of Peace"") often referred to as O'Sensei the Great Teacher, is widely considered the greatest martial artist the world has ever seen. Aikido is regarded as the most difficult and effective of the martial arts, finding it's basis wholly in the ability to invert an aggressor's force. Aikido relies on physical conditioning and a series of locks and throws rather than injurious kicks and punches. It has been documented that in his seventies Ueshiba could restrain an attacker with one finger or evade multiple attackers with such grace that he appeared to become invisible to them.Ueshiba was a pacifist at a time when Japan was becoming increasingly militaristic. He credited his development of Aikido to a series of visions which occurred over the course of his lifetime and convinced him of the universatility of humanity. He saw Warrior traditions as having evolved beyond mere adventures in hostility into a clarion call to protect and defend, respect and honor all things. As such, THE ART OF PEACE is the taproot of all Aikido training. It is a brief book which holds many profound thoughts deserving of reflection. The Aikidoka needs to take THE ART OF PEACE as a foundation stone for further learning and awareness. Unsurprisingly, much of the substance of THE ART OF PEACE will be familiar to students of Zen, and this volume should form a portion of the library of any Sangha.    ",1

"This is a unique and oustanding book which, for starters, points out that what most Americans think of as ""Yoga"", i.e. asana or postures, is the tip of an iceberg which began hundreds of years before, but which has had little clear explanation for Western readers.  Stephen Cope is obviously a learned scholar, and able to explain rather impenetrable Eastern philosophy in clear, concise, understandable writing, and to place it in the contexts of both centuries of philosophical thought (both Eastern and Western) and of modern psychology, fields in which Mr. Cope is clearly a master. By juxtaposing his crystal clear discussions of yogic philosophy with easy-reading examples of 5 contemporary ""seekers"", he has made the book extremely accessable to beginner and veteran yogis alike. With his unique background as a psychotherapist and ""scholar in residence"" at Kripalu, I suspect there are few if any others who could do this.If you have practiced yoga postures and found something special, you have only dipped your toe into an ocean.  This book will open the door to a new world",1

"Lora Arduser & Douglas Brown have clearly struck upon the key components one must consider when opening a Bed & Breakfast. The initial chapters cover some of the more complicated financial considerations prospective operators should address when getting started: site research, local/federal laws and regulations, bank financing and real estate options - such as buying an existing B & B or starting from ""scratch"". Practical ideas are not forgotten and are also presented;  such as visiting neighboring B & B's for comparison research, considerations regarding appropriate d?cor, recommendations on preparing a guest services policy, hints on picking a memorable name and ways to establish a presence on the Internet. This handbook also comes with a CD-ROM that is extremely helpful for those more comfortable using generic templates and check-lists designed by professionals; surely a consideration when there are so many demands on ones time during the start-up process. These include personnel forms, purchase orders, food facility compliance checklists and guest ledgers. Other worthwhile chapters touch on topics often left out of similar resources - researching phone systems, attending to landscape details, establishing house rules and kitchen safety. This handy guide proves itself time and time again as a gem of a resource",1

"     There are a number of things that are exceptional about this DVD. First, one can easily see the spaciousness and beauty of the concert hall. This new Gewandhaus zu Leipzig was built in the 1980's.  However, when I first heard the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra in Leipzig in the mid-1970's, they were playing in an auditorium near the Leipzig zoo.  American and British planes severely damaged the old Gewandhaus zu Leipzig in a bombing raid in February, 1944. Second, the DVD introduces Riccardo Chailly, the new conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra.  Seeing and hearing him conduct is reassuring that he is the right man for the job. Being the principal conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra tends to groom one for greatness.  Third, the entire DVD is either music that Schumann exclusively composed or music that other composers (Tschaikovsky and Ravel) orchestrated from Schumann's piano music.     The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra still sounds like the great orchestra that it has always been.  In 1991, Kurt Masur stated that 85% of the orchestra members were, as is he, alumni of the Leipzig Conservatory. A Leipzig resident of my acquaintance claims that the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra has become large enough to provide a visiting concert in a distant city as well as provide a concert in the Gewandhaus zu Leipzig at the same time.  In response, I would simply say, ""Thank God for the conservatory.""     The Piano Concerto in A minor by Robert Schumann was written for a female concert pianist, his wife - Clara.  Martha Argerich most ably substitutes for Clara, providing a very strong, sensitive, even lyrical interpretation, always being in control. It can be argued that Martha Argerich is the most qualified living pianist to play the Schumann piano concerto.  Many years ago when I first heard Martha Argerich, I thought her playing to be bombastic pyrotechnics, and that she was sort of the female Lazar Berman.  I can no longer consider that to be in any way correct.  Seeing her silhouette while hearing her mastery, I had the fleeting impression that maybe I was hearing Clara.  Her performance was clearly masterful, and the people of Leipzig responded to the excellence of that performance by giving her a very well deserved encore.  Clara herself described this concerto as an intertwining of the piano and orchestra, so much so that one could not consider one without the other.  This performance embodies that attitude.  The performance is exquisite, with the customary dark, somber sound of the strings of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra.     Riccardo Chailly's interpretation of the Symphony in D Minor, Opus 120 (1851 version) is beautiful and authoritative.  He senses the subtleties of Schumann's intent and evokes them for all to hear.  Those conductors who have interpreted Schumann's works with either the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra or the Dresden Staatskapelle seem generally to get it right.  For example, Wolfgang Sawallish recorded the Schumann symphonies most beautifully with the Dresden Staatskapelle thirty some years ago.  I very much like Kurt Masur's interpretation of Schumann, and he has recorded the Schumann symphonies with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. As he did with New York, he has done with this orchestra.  He has made it worth listening to, but it still does not have the sound of Leipzig.I would like to hear Riccardo Chailly record all of the Schumann symphonies.  Right now, it's one down, three to go.     This DVD is a recording of an actual concert in the Gewandhaus zu Leipzig, and, for that reason, it does not follow the order expected of two major pieces and several lesser pieces.  The DVD begins with two piano pieces orchestrated by Tschaikovsky.  The piano concerto is next, with a short encore, ""Von fremden Landern und Menschen.""  Then follows selections from Carnaval, orchestrated by Ravel.  The concert ends with Schumann's Fourth Symphony.  To get to the piano concerto or the symphony directly, one must choose ""Chapters"" and choose where you want the music to start.     To true Schumann lovers, this DVD is a must.  After all, Leipzig and Dresden were Schumann's home territory.  Historically, the piano concerto was first performed by the Dresden Staatskapelle and shortly afterwards by the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, with Clara Schumann as pianist.  The tradition starts there.  The performances on this DVD certainly continue it.",0
"There are two basic types of music fans: (1) people who like to read quotes from the members of Pink Floyd explaining how they actually put together their records and (2) people who think Pink Floyd are, whoa, a  trip. People in the first category will love this book. Unlike other  similar books, this is an actual history of record production in  chronological order. Cunningham is a talented writer. He's also a respected  producer and player himself, which means he knows just about everyone who  is anyone behind the scenes of record making, and they all seem to have  agreed to talk to him! The book is worth buying just for all the little  anecdotes, such as the time the trumpet soloist on &quot;Penny Lane&quot;  inadvertently offended John Lennon at the session, or the time one of the  world's top producers, Chris Thomas, was beat up by thugs while recording  the Sex Pistols. But it's also full of important, hard facts. The section  on Motown, for example, cuts through all the usual mythology about  everything being recorded in Detroit, and provides quote after quote from  actual participants explaining how Los Angeles session musicians (Carol  Kaye, Earl Palmer, Hal Blaine, etc.) played on many of the biggest mid-'60s  Motown hits. That's typical of the book: Cunningham does his homework.  While most writers have a hard time even explaining what a Mellotron is, he  gives a detailed history of the instrument, and its use on particular hit  records, and provides an interesting quote from George Martin about the  instrument, and figures out where the actual Mellotron the Beatles used on  &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; is today. This is not the sort of  simplistic hero-worship PR that entertains the average person in the  average magazine. It's a thick, accurate, intelligent book, full of  authentic, little-known stories, told from the inside, and they're  fascinating",1
"If you could buy just one and only one book on how to get along with your bird, THIS IS IT.  I bought it in 1998 after seeing the 20/20 segment featuring Ms. Athan.  Since then, I have used it as THE GUIDE for questions or curiousities I have relating to how to get along with my bird.This book is a subsequent edition from the one I have, but I have every confidence that it is just as fantastic as the first edition--which Ms. Athan autographed for me this spring when I attended one of her seminars.The best part of this book are the games such as ""blink"" that she teaches.  Before bringing home any new bird, read and reread this chapter extensively, then keep it with you like a life preserver and play those games.  Blink especially is a fantastic game for gauging a parrot's basic feelings about your presence.  I also learned to keep my hands behind my back when approaching my birds from this book so I assume the body language of a relaxed bird.These and other techniques are absolutely the best.So again--if you buy just one book in your entire life on parrots--THIS IS IT.  BUY IT!",1
"How can the insubstantial possibly overcome the substantial? This book does a great job of clearly explaining many of the principles of tai chi and manages to avoid the mystical without losing the mystery.

The book begins with chapters on what Bach Flower remedies are and why they are appropriate for animals.  This is followed by an alphabetical list of all the remedies and conditions they may benefit.  It is all very easy to understand.A very useful book",1

I would recamend this book for anyone. This is my new favorite book besides the Bible. It really brings the New Testament alive and speaks the truth right to your heart. This book will help bring Christians closer to God and let you see Him throughout the word. This is a great book for Christians who want to grow closer to God and for none-Christians to see God throughout the Bible. I recomend this book for everybody,1

"I had to mark &quot;one star&quot; since the reviewing system wouldn't allow me to give &quot;zero stars&quot;.  I was very disappointed to see  that someone supposedly very educated would assume that the &quot;absent  father was the culprit.&quot; (see pages 91-92) Did he ever consider that  there are fathers who wants equal time with their child(ren) but are denied  time because their former and soon to be former wives have convinced others  that the fathers are undeserving of such time?  Imagine a wife who creates  a massive amount of debt while her husband works two jobs to pay the bills,  she begins an extramarital relationship with a co-worker, she hides her  commission money from her husband, she leaves her husband with all of the  bills, she files for a divorce, she files for custody in order to limit a  child's time with his father, and she files for child support in order to  get child support money even though he is still paying all of the bills  that she accumulated only because they are considered joint debts and he  doesn't want to damage his credit.  Who is really the &quot;culprit&quot;?   I returned this book to Amazon.com, and I will never read another book by  this author again",1
"Thanks to the work of historians, filmmakers, memoirists, and novelists, we have some ideas about what the big players in the Third Reich were like as well as the victims of the Holocaust. But what was it like to be an ordinary German during the 30s and 40s, when Hitler rose to power? Hunt's personal memoir provides us with a glimpse into the world of the ordinary, respectable German families who backed his reforms and regime, and then had to live through the consequences of World War II. She writes vividly of her childhood in Berchtesgaden, a town nestled in the German Alps where Hitler and many of his top lieutenants maintained their primary residences outside of Berlin. She draws portraits of the adults around her, and their attitudes towards Hitler-ranging from the slavish allegiance of a despised teacher, to the critical skepticism of her beloved grandfather. She ends with a reminder of how easily complacency and conformism can lead to the worst political regimes. Hunt's book is a great read, beautifully and elegantly written, honest and frank on topics which still make many Germans uncomfortable, with many photos of her childhood in Berchtesgaden and anecdotes and stories which make this period of her life, and of German history, come alive. Highly recommended! This would make a great addition to any high school or college European history course reading list.",1
"I love all Fred Gwynne's books for kids.  The drawings are exceptionally well done, and the expressions on some faces are priceless.  The book shifts our adult perspective a bit to remember what it was like as a kid to hear grown-ups use certain phrases, and the pictures they conjured up in literalist-child minds-- putting a wing on the house, or playing the piano by ear",1
"I must say, this is one of the best movies ive ever seen! Not many movies or shows portray band as a good thing. For example American Pie Band Camp, That 70's Show, etc. And the opus at the end is one of the most amazing songs ive ever heard. And refering to the person who left a review before me... To me and most people in band, music is more important than core classes and funding SHOULD be provided by the school. My band has to fund itself, meaning the students have to pay to be in marching band, and we have to do fundraisers to collect much needed money. Its like trying to run a theme park on $100 a week.Anyway, i would recommend this movie to anyone who loves band and/or music",0
"Tragic yet hilarious, &quot;The Color of Summer&quot; is a bitter frolic through the lives of homosexuals in Fidel Castro's Cuba. Opening with a stunning 50-page play, the farce continues to sing throughout the remaining  pages. The ill-fated sojourns of so many characters are detailed, but  always with a willingness to see the humor within the suffering of men who  seek pleasure despite the risk of punishment by a tyrant and his faithful  firing squads. A nice piece of political commentary aimed at the seat of  Castro's olive-green pants, &quot;The Color of Summer&quot; reveals the  leaks in the dictator's &quot;air-tight&quot; oppressive regime, leaving  Castro at the center of ridicule. With wonderful character development,  gleaming threads of honesty appear within the blanket of mischeivous men  whose tales are told in the most amusingly crass manner",1
"I just started reading the Stone Barrington series.  I'm finding that with each book, his storytelling gets a little better.  Mind you, the first two were both enjoyable and quick reads, but I found that this one was more exciting.  It's not necessary to rehash the plot, but the book definitely builds momentum at the end.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to other Stone Barrington fans.  You will find, though, that it is best to read the books in order.  He builds on the character with each book and makes references that would be lost if you haven't read each book that preceded it",1
"All the Fun's in How You Say a Thing is of far greater significance and value to poets and students of poetry than any of the other &quot;how-to&quot; guides, handbooks, manuals and critical studies to date.   It is painlessly thorough and brilliantly supported by a rich selection of  examples; its author is a master of clarity, eloquence, and graceful  scholarship. In 1990, Timothy Steele gave us &quot;Missing Measures:   Modern Poetry and the Revolt Against Meter.&quot;  Now, in 1999 he gives us  this new treasure.  These works are the bookends of the decade.  Poetry  simply doesn't stand up without them",1

"With this book, I think that Deborah Crombie proves her right to be up there with P.D. James and Elizabeth George.  This is a beautifully written, though complex tale of love, possession, hate and evil.  In this book Gemma has a murder in her patch.  It's her first big case as Inspector, and the murder is of prominent woman who had her throat cut in her own driveway.  Gemma and her new team try to put the pieces together and as they start to do that it becomes apparent to her and to Duncan Kincaid that there are striking similarities between this case and one that happened in Duncan's territory.  They get to work together to try to prove a connection.  At the same time Duncan and Gemma are combining their households and moving in together.  It should be a completely happy time for them, but they both find that this case is going to  cause tragedy to a number of lives, maybe even their own.  This is a rich, complex, psychological thriller that is extremely complex and multi-faceted. I take my hat off to Ms. Crombi",1

"Intimidated by the tiny chicks you see in aerobics classes? Fear no more! While the fitness industry implies otherwise, large women, too, have the right to exercise and be fit. This book will inspire and empower you to move your body-if you want to. The authors are adamant in their stance that  large women have the same right as anyone else to work out  or choose not to. The emphasis is on having fun and enjoying  your body. While describing various activities, the book also discusses the special needs larger women face while exercising, such as supportive bras and sturdy shoes. There is no reason to hide in the house and avoid life just because you are larger than someone else! This book is gentle, encouraging, and eye-opening,  and-you may have guessed this already-written by two large  women, one who teaches aerobics and one who loves sports",1
"The serious student of Shakespeare's most popular plays cannot dispense with this superlative anthology.  While not every play is present here, 20 or so of the most popular are, and each play is accompanied by the most extensive study material I've ever seen, including notes on themes, staging challenges, and film versions...way beyond the typical historical and critical introductions found in other anthologies (although those are included too).  The text is richly illustrated with artwork and photography and the texts of the play themselves are in David Bevington's popular format.  Best of all, the generous margins coupled with large type face make reading and personal annotating a joy.  Highly, highly reccomended",1
"This is a particularly beautiful book.  It is handsomely printed and bound and even has a decorative slipcase.  That is delightful to look at and hold (while being durable) is quite important for a large anthology because it is a volume you will return to again and again over many years.  It is also beautiful because of its contents.  The hundreds of poems written by more than two hundred poets from the sixteenth century to the present offer a galaxy of religious expression.  However, the word ""religious"" needs to be given some sort of frame for the reader to understand what this book is about.As the subtitle notes, this anthology was put together by the critic, Yale professor, and author, Harold Bloom.  Some of his richest ideas, that he returns to often, involve the ideas of creative misreading, the power of literary figures to reshape human sense of self (consciousness), and also the idea of the American Religion.  That is, the use and interpretation of religious imagery, doctrines, thoughts, and emotions through the lens of the American identity and character.  While this is not something I can present to you here, there is a wonderful essay by Bloom to open the volume and that can help you understand how these poems were selected and what they represent in Bloom's scheme of things.  For him (as he notes on page xlv), ""Whitman was our Homer, Dickinson our Shakespearean lyricist, Crane our Pindar, and Emerson our Plato"".  This gives you a strong idea what he is thinking about.What this book is not is a collection of devotional poems.  Certainly the poems are not orthodox meditations of any particular sect or creed.  There are a few overtly traditionally religious poems, but most are poems of hope, meditations on topics such as death and aspects of the human condition, expressions of ecstasy, powerful uses of traditional religious imagery for very human poems, and just about anything you can think of that could be connected in some way to the broader American experience of religion.  Given Bloom's emphasis on the idea of ""The American Religion"" (he even wrote a book of that title), a more appropriate title of this book might have been ""Poems of the American Religion"".  This would have avoided the need for the disclaimer I gave in the last paragraph, but would have probably raised more questions about what the American Religion is.  However, given the nature of the selections, that is a necessary question.  Again, Bloom addresses this well in the opening essay.While America is an overtly religious country, regardless of the efforts of some to make that not so, there is an increasing ignorance of certain religious ideas and symbols.  There is a section in the back of the book that explains certain terms and ideas.  There is also a list of sources, a few notes on the text, an index of poets by name, and an explanatory note by Jesse Zuba in the front that sets out the goals and purpose of the volume.The poems are arranged chronologically from oldest to newest (hence the need for the index of poets by name in the back).  It is quite fascinating to watch the language and tone of the verse change not only from poet to poet, but from decade to decade or century to century.  Today is quite different than three hundred years ago.  Yet, certain ideas and questions remain.  We just place our feet at different angles to them with a different tilt to our head and hands.This is a volume you should have on your bookshelf and immerse yourself in these words again and again.  And thank the Library of America for bringing us something so richly rewarding and so delightful to read",1
"Dr. Feingold's book saved my sanity in 1985 through this book!  My daughter who was absolutely unable to follow directions, or  listen for more than one minute is just the beginning of descibing her challanging behavior before applying this book to her life!  She was so hyperactive it meant a day of running around in circles, running up a wall, jumping off of furniture, absolutely &quot;crazy&quot; actions constantly.  Our lives with her were sheer he--: trying to go out in public, attend religious events, visit friends/relatives, go to the park or groucery store meant an exhausting, unpleasant experience!  I had taken her to a nutrionist, allergist, &amp; psychiatrist to find an anwer and help.  No specialist was able to help.  I bought this book figuring that we were running out of hope; let's try it.   I read this book and began following Dr. Feingold's methods exactly as he writes.  Within four days my daughter's behavior changed into a normal functioning small child.  My mother came to visit us on the fourth day of the Feingold Diet and was upset thinking that I had heavily medicated my daughter because her behavior was totally normal for a child her age!!!!!  I explained what I did:  exliminating all foods and starting fresh from scratch and slowly reintroducing foods.  My daughter has NEVER been medicated for hyperactivity or any behavior disorder.  We only fed her what was well tolerated.  THIS BOOK IS A MIRACLE TO OUR LIVES!!!!!!!  From 1985 to today has been a wonderful experience with my daughter!!!!!!  She has been very successful in school (including college), sports, popular, and a pleasure to be around!!!!!  This is the complete truth.  I hope that other parents will take the time to get the book for the child who is &quot;uncontrollabe, hyperactive, or unfocused&quot; and follow it!  The initial few weeks are difficult but it is worth every ounce of energy utilized!!!!!  Please, for your sanity and your child's acceptance get and practice Dr. Feingold's methods to your child's life; it works!!!",1
"If there is one word I can use to describe these photographs, it would have to be erotic.  Sure, they are artistic.  But for me, the main attraction and the main reason for buying this book is to look at nude pictures of beautiful people.  Inside the book, you will find nude pictures of men, women, teens, and children.  Please keep in mind that this may not be the book for you if you are mainly interested in looking at nude pictures of women who look like playmates, models, and cover girls.  Jock Sturges, to his credit, chose to photograph average-looking people.  If you are a fan of this type of art photography, then let me recommend that you also take a look at Radiant Identities and Immediate Family.  Both are excellent photography books also.  I also recommend the works of David Hamilton",1
"This season of The Shield is as good as the others. The drama is conflicting and on-the-edge of your seat. If you like characters that are not knights in shining armors, you'll love this show.

"What can we say? If you lived it you know. The War, the Times, the Government. Our country was lead by falures and the grunts were the ones that took the bullet. I remember in 1968 I quit reading the newspapers as they made me sick and I wondered if our great country would survive. We did but patriots as Lewis didn't. In my heart and I hope in millions of others we will always remember him. The book is the most touching I have ever read.",1
"Adam Guettel's latest masterwork, The Light in the Piazza, has graced the Broadway stage since April 2005.  Now, we can all enjoy the love songs that have made audiences swoon in our homes and our local stages.  These vocal selections were wonderfully chosen from a gorgeous score.  Ten of the best pieces from the Tony Winning Best Original Score made the cut including:The Beauty IsFableLove to MeThe Light in the PiazzaAs a very balanced selection, this book includes challenging songs for both experienced men and women to perform.  The songs remain in their original difficult keys, like the composer intended.  Not only is the score vocally taxing, the music will not be easy for beginning pianists.  However, many subtle nuances including the beautiful harp-like arpeggios are maintained for a very full sound on the piano.Songs like Fable benefited from this fleshed-out adaptation because of its many intricate harmonic under workings.  Like most Hal Leonard publications, the music is very clean and easy to read, but it also moves the vocal line into the accompaniment.  This is both a pro and con.  For singers who wanted only an accompaniment, this is not it.  Yet, for pianists who yearned for a solo performance piece or singers who don't mind a light vocal line, this book is fantastic.The book finishes with a Performance Edition of the title song.  With these added flourishes, this song sounds as enchanting as it does at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre.  It would have been nice, though, if all the songs in this book received the same treatment as this song.Even with that minor quibble, these Vocal Selections are an absolute joy to have and perform.  From The Beauty Is's bouncing vitality to the simple harmonies of Love to Me, this book includes the best of Guettel's award winning work.  The book also includes Notes on the show, Guettel's biography, and several pages of full-color pictures that detail the talented Original Broadway Cast.  Go see it on Broadway, buy the Cast Recording, and then purchase this book.  Adam Guettel in the Light for American musical theatre and he shines in The Light in the Piazza",1

"I'm beyond words.  It is pulp fiction at it's most riveting.  It is history and conspiracy turned upside down.  It is humanity in criminals and criminality in heroes and lots in between.  I love Ellroy's style.  This first bit of fiction of his that I have read and I can't wait to read the rest of his novels.  He is amazing.  The story is complicated, but you never get lost.  It is &quot;What if..&quot; history.  It is fact and lots of fiction, but it works.  Just read it.  If you love Ellroy, crime fiction, historical fiction, or just a good book...this is it",1

"This is, without a doubt, one of DM's best albums, which isn't surprising as singles are supposed to be the best songs on the album. Although there are some shaky moments--namely in ""Condemnation"" ""Little 15"" and ""A Question of Time,"" the rest of the album is fantastic, allowing us to hear how DM has changed over the years without jumping around too much. This is a great way to get introduced to DM--nobody can hear such great songs like ""A Question of Lust"" ""Walking in my Shoes,"" ""Personal Jesus"" or ""It's No Good"" and fail to like the band. This is a fantastic album",0
"Walt Disney had a winner with this adaptation of the book of the same title by Johann David Wyss.  The book itself was a fantasy with bits and pieces of the new world aggregated onto a single island in the Pacific.  The book fantasy makes for a rousing adventure as a family is wrecked and abandoned near a tropical paradise.We meet the Robinson's at the beginning of the movie.  The Late Dorothy McGuire, who also appeared in Disney's ""Summer Magic,"" ""Old Yeller,"" ""Friendly Persuasion,"" and numerous other movies and television shows, plays Mother Robinson.  The Late Sir John Mills, one of the most beloved actors in England and father of Hayley Mills and Juliet Mills, plays Father Robinson.  James MacArthur, who has been in a number of other Disney films and was Danno in Hawaii Five-O, plays Fritz Robinson.  Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran, also Disney regulars, play Ernst and Francis Robinson.  The Robinson's begin the movie in deep trouble.  They are below decks on a sailing ship that was headed toward New Guinea.  As we later learn, the ship was going to New Guinea when pirates appeared.  The captain evaded the pirates, but ran into a storm.  The crew then abandoned ship, leaving the Robinson's behind.The Robinson's wreck on a reef not far from a beautiful tropical island.  The island is paradise, but paradise with the most interesting collection of wild animals imaginable.  There are zebras, hyenas, a tiger, at least one snake that was an anaconda according to the book, a baby elephant, and ostriches.  Imagine a circus train wrecking on this island and you will get the general picture.  The island also proves to be a very nice play to live, especially after the family recovers as much as possible from the wrecked ship.The family builds a marvelous tree house with running water and a master bedroom suite.  Soon there are sidewalks, games, and a castle of sorts.  Fritz and Ernst encounter Roberta (played by the late Janet Munro), and in addition to surviving on the island, the family gets to witness two young men fighting over the only available girl.Life appears to be going well except for the danger of the pirates, whom the family encounters three times in the movie.  Between the pirates, the wild animals, the shipwreck and fighting over Roberta, this movie is full of non-stop action!Walt Disney put pure magic into this adventure movie.  The story is interesting and easy to follow.  The family conquers adversity, remaining positive throughout.  There is mild violence, but so mild that the movie was able to keep a G rating.  I think this movie is a winner for all but the very youngest family members.This 2-disk release is filled with extras that are generally enjoyable.  There is the short that went with the movie when it was originally released.  There are interviews, making of, and all sorts of related tidbits that make this 2-disk set a must have for fans of this movie.  The best part of all is that this movie is in wide screen, which is enough reason to throw away your old version, especially if you have a wide screen television.I have watched this movie in the theater, on television, and on VHS tape.  As many times as I have watched this movie, I enjoy it each and every time.  Take a trip into the adventuresome past for an outstanding and fun family movie adventure.  Enjoy!",0
"Blomberg, an expert in the Synoptics, does a superb job, showing the inadequacies of much liberal gospel scholarship, and making an eminently credible case for the overall historical reliability of the canonical gospels. This is clearly going to be a classic, and anyone interested in Biblical Studies should read it",1
"Hag's voice has deepened by this album and he uses that instrument very well here.  This recording is as artistically superior as his Capitol stuff, but with a different sound and different topics.  The whole album fits together, from the theme of running from life and trying to forget one's problems, to memories (false or imagined?) of a loving childhood, to staring all the problems a man can have in the face and declaring that there'll be roses in the winter because love is all we have to have (though you know a tough road lies ahead). A great combination of songs, singing, and musicianship.  That this is basically a bargain bin album tells you all you need to know about the state of country music today.  This album deserves a remastered, deluxe version with liner notes for godsakes",0
"This is the last book Lewis wrote before his death, and it was published posthumously. The title suggests it is a collection of letters, but it is actually a fictional correspondence, a chance for Lewis to offer some of his most mature meditations on prayer, mysticism, suffering, and the soul-work of Christian pilgrimage. This Lewis classic deserves to be much more widely known than it is",1

"After getting a taste of Paco with their debut EP, it was great to finally get a full-length release - and it was worth the wait. &quot;This is Where We Live&quot; is an excellent venture into electropop. The blending of electronic and organic instruments is well done, and the production is top-notch. Dominique Durand's voice, as always, is great, and the instrumental work compliments it perfectly. Standouts for me are &quot;Shaded,&quot; &quot;Who Do You Think You Are,&quot; &quot;Thin&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Satie.&quot",0

"Sportswriter James (Ty) Tyrone covers the racing scene for a British tabloid.  A colleague drunkenly offers to give him 'a piece of advice' but before he can remember what it is falls out of a 7th floor window to his death.  A tragic accident...or is it.  As Ty begins to investigate he uncovers a far reaching conspiracy throughout the racing world.  Before he can bring the criminals to justice Ty has to fight for his and his invalid wife's lives.As always with a Francis novel the reader is taken into another aspect of the racing world (this time it is sports writing).  The hero is stoic, bravely bearing up to his deep personal tragedy, (this time a beloved wife crippled by polio) who must endure many trials before he emerges triumphant in the end.While Francis' work is formulistic it is also quite good.  The mystery is cleverly done, the action exciting.  The hero is flawed but sympathetic, his situation touching and when he defeats the bad guys the reader is left with a good feeling.If you are already a fan of the series this one is another winner.  If you are new to the series this is a good place to start",1

"The movie is really enjoyable.I love almost all the Seagal films, but this flic is specially awesome because Vinnie Jones is in it.Seagal has only two short(but great trademark)fights, but Vinnie has an incredible couple more that makes the movie a good choice for rent and better to buy(with the prices I see), and because the more you see the movie the more you like it.The only bad thing is the vocal dubbing of Seagal, but I don?t give it a damn because the movie is good action-packed.I think the better latest Seagal DTV movies to buy are Submerged with Mercenary, his best DTV ever.Pretty tandem Seagal-Jones...yeah, I?m very happy to have bought the dvd, it?s well worth",0
"I read Peterson's and Fisher's ""Wild America"" in 1955 when it first was published.  My father belonged to a book club and this book was the primary selection one month. It was an enchanting read and it strengthened my interest in all of the biota of North America, although I eventually became a professional biologist specializing in invertebrates.Scott Weidensaul has now retraced the travels recorded in the earlier book and published it as ""Return to Wild America.""  It is an apt title and in it Weidensaul shows the curious reader what has happened in the intervening 50 years along the route taken by Peterson and Fisher.As with Peterson and Fisher, Weidensaul starts in Newfoundland at Cape St. Mary and the now larger colonies of seabirds.  Yes, in the intervening years the seabirds have flourished, but there are dark signs on the horizon from the collapse of the great fisheries of the North Atlantic. This collapse may alter the food web of the Atlantic and threaten the survival of the bird colonies. Indeed, the author sees both signs of hope and signs of danger and destruction during the trip from Newfoundland, south through Washington, D. C., and still further into the Everglades of Florida. The author traveled through the dry Tortugas and then Texas and the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge.  Next the journey took him into Mexico and the tropics near Xilitla at the base of the Sierra Madre Oriental, Texas again, the Arizona sky island mountain ranges, the Pacific Coast, Alaska and finally the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea.  During all of this he notes the changes, or lack of them, and the magnificent wildlife seen along the way.This is to a large extent a hymn to the glories of the North American Continent and especially to those of the United States and Mexico.  Despite major changes in the last 50 years, and the extinction of major species and the depletion of others over the last several centuries (as also noted by Peterson and Fisher), huge developments, strip mining and logging, market hunting and other abuses, there are still many jewels in the North American  wild places.However, all of these are threatened by new and potentially larger changes brought on by acid rain, global warming and continued population growth.  It will certainly take a major miracle to keep the dire consequences of such changes from making inroads and even destroying a lot of the fantastic wilderness (if now not quite pristine) that we still have.  If you would know some of what we may loose, read ""Return to Wild America.",1
"I will declare right off that I am a Frank Sinatra fan so I am a little biased about all of his recordings (I don't own Tone Poems conducted by Sinatra, but just about everything else is on my shelves). Many of his recordings are divided by tempo, there's the, ""In The Wee Small Hours"" ballad group and then there's the mid or up tempo recordings like ""Songs for Swingin Lovers"". I love so many of these albums, but this is the one I'd marry, (I've carried the analogy too far). Every song is  a fantastic page from The Great American Songbook (I've Got You Under My Skin, How About You, Pennies From Heaven, I Thought About You), the arrangements are by Riddle and he was never in better form. Love the cover and oh yeah Frank's voice. If you plan on being stranded on that proverbial desert island take your CD player and a copy of ""Songs for Swingin Lovers"" and sunscreen",0

"I bought a copy of this magazine and initially enjoyed a great deal of it, but ultimately found it distasteful.  It was graphically hyperactive, which became distracting and irritating, and there was something else that didn't seem quite right, though at first I couldn't identify just what that was.  Eventually I realized that it wasn't making a clear distinction between the editorial content and commerce (items offered by companies advertizing in the magazine, workshops sponsored by the magazine, books sold by the publisher of the magazine).  Eventually I figured out that the publisher was Australian.  If Rupert Murdoch is any guide, then this magazine is coming from a tradition that doesn't respect boundaries between journalism and financial gain.  I ended up putting this magazine aside in distaste",0
"I'm not going to go into great detail although I am tempted to rebut the reviewer who tagged this album with 2 stars.  That reviewer is obviously a pure hip-hop fan that is offended by Saul's challenging of the current state of rap and hip-hop music.  This album has something for everyone...the rap fan, the rock fan, and the fan of poetry.  I just can't believe it has been out this long and I never heard of it.  I happened to go see Saul at a multi-band concert this summer and was so impressd that I swore to buy an album.  I thought it would be less impressive than his live performance, but it dramatically exceeded my expectations.  Any album that can make pull out my Mars Volta CD has jolted itself to the heights of my playlist. ",0
"Bottom-line:  Well worth your precious time!  You know the author understands today's fast-paced work environment and family situation when in the introduction she suggests that you take her 80-item quiz to discover your areas of weakness and then go straight to the most needed chapters without having to read the entire book.  However, you WILL want to read this entire book. Here's why: The author has chosen a clever ""house"" metaphor to describe the eight pillars that support your life:  plans, priorities, personality, pests (timewasters), possessions, paper, post (your job), play.  Within each of those chapters, she gets VERY specific with quizzes to create self-awareness about how we sabotage ourselves and our time. That is, once you become aware of what keeps you from spending time as you intend, she gives plenty of concrete how-tos that you can use immediately to change the picture--everything from how to sleep better at night so you accomplish more the next day at work, ... how to save time on the telephone,...how to stop making excuses for watching TV every night when you need to redecorate the bedroom, ... how to organize your photo album collection.Whether you're a slacker or a productivity guru already, you can certainly pick up many valuable pointers from this book to make sure you achieve your goals--for a day or a lifetime",1

"I love this book!!! I received several baby books for my first child none of which I was crazy about but I decided to go with Baby Love by Susan Branch, while it is cute and I like some of the things she suggests to include, it is designed more like a regular book with thin paper pages which makes it difficult to add things (even pictures) and to enter info into it because of the way it is organized.  I received this book today for the child I am expecting in few months and I plan on purchasing another for my first child because it is so much better than Baby Love.  It has a adorable frames for pictures and plenty of places to put them, a lot of storage pockets, sturdy pages, and plenty (but not too much) room to write stuff.  I felt pressured to fill out the info requested in Baby Love, but I am excited to fill out the pages in this one.  Best one I have seen so far.",1
"I was first introduced to this book as a camper at a camp in North Carolina; I have since returned as a counselor there and have read it to my campers (who loved it as well)!  As a children's book it is fantastic because although each chapter presents a different story with its own plot, each also weaves together with the other chapters to produce a larger plot based on the same settings and characters.  This makes for great suspense for the kids from one reading to another!  In addition, it is a great tool for conveying the biblical lessons pertaining to a Christian's daily walk.  The stories are allegories.  The format can even be seen as allegorical in the sense that, while each believer has a personal walk with Christ and daily experiences therein, each is also a part of the whole of Christ's body, the church...with the overall picture of a Savior dying to redeem sinners and one day returning to establish His eternal Kingdom.  This book is fantastic!!  I recommend it to all --whether child or adult!-- who would seek a tremendously written children's book which will encourage, challenge, and teach one in the ways of the King!  (I, too, believe that the old edition illustrated by Jack Stockman needs to be revived!!",1
"I ordered this book with the idea, based on how it was advertised,that it was a summary of Esther Wilkins book. Instead,it was a workbook, without answer keys. It requires that you also have the book &quot; Clinical practice of the Dental Hygienist&quot; by Wilkins, for it to be of any value. I was very disappointed as to how it was represented by amazon.ca and the editorial review is not correct for the product",1
"If you loved this movie, you'll love this book! Though it is not the adapted story from the film.

The price was great too, the best I found on the web. ",0
"I strongly feel that this book must be read in the context of other books of its era, as well as the artistic and poetical zeitgeist, and not only those if the era in whch it was written, but that in which the beginning and the personality of the narrator is set. This is a book such as Wagner would have written, Wilde would have rejoiced in, Swinburne been inspired by. The enormity of the canvas, the breadth of field, all are characteristic of the fin de siecle romantic disaster in its best and most eloquent portrayal. Even the faults of the work are those of the style. It is very easy to imagine the whole work as an outgrowth of the late nineteenth-century operatic tradition, with the same assumptions about the nobility of the hero, the clinging vine purity of the heroine, the handkerchief-wringing finale. I would allow this comparison to colour the reading of the work. Read in this way, the true greatness can be seen through a corrective prism, adding in an understanding of the distortions of their world-view and removing the distortions of the prevailing zeitgeist of our time.

"I think this is the first novel I've ever read twice. It's an odd choice for that, as it's not my favorite. I read it in college at the recommendation of my creative writing professor, who thought it might be helpful in structuring a story on which I was working. And the structure, more than anything, is the most innovative part of the book. An example of literary impressionism, the narrator paints the story with small brush strokes, a scene here and there, out of order, from different perspectives. He examines each character individually, because it is more about the characters and their motivations than it is about the plot. It is left to the reader to put the pieces together--the narrator gives more of an impression than a complete picture. 	But THE GOOD SOLDIER is #30 on The Modern Library's top novels of the 20th century, which means that it must have more than just structure. I have to admit that, until I got to the very end, both times I read the book, I wondered what the allure was. The book's first sentence is ""This is the saddest story I have ever heard."" But throughout, I kept getting the feeling that it was little more than a jumbled romantic melodrama. The characters are all flawed in ways that makes them real but not particularly likable. They are all extremely well off, which makes their dismal state even more frustrating--these people have everything--Why aren't they happy? But then in the end, somehow--and maybe it's just the last few pages that do it--I realize that these characters are great. Particularly Edward Ashburnham, the soldier of the book's title, is a very likable character. And we're almost willing to overlook his one vice--his womanizing--partly because he's such a sentimentalist but mostly because his wife is such a wretch, the only truly wicked character in the book. 	As for the plot, it's almost not worth detailing. As I said, it's more about the characters and how the plot is structured than the plot itself. There are five principle characters: Edward and Leonora Ashburnham, John and Florence Dowell, and Nancy Rufford. Two commit suicide, one goes crazy, and the other two suffer perhaps the worse fate of living completely plain, boring, lonely lives. In the end, it is a very sad story, if for no other reason than that most of it is so unnecessary--with the exception of Leornora, any of these people could have lived happy lives if it weren't for each other",1

"I read this book to an active Kindergarten class and they were completely engaged!  We were celebrating the first day of winter so it tied in nicely with the snow, sledding, and snowman theme.  The photographs are beautiful but, what the children enjoyed most was the animals voices in the story.  Each animal ""talks like it sounds"" in nature.  For example the mourning dove's ""Coo-coo-could that be him?"" This book is an instant wintertime classic (you may also appreciate the subtle undertones of conservation and care of our forest friends).  The hardcover edition would make a terrific gift for any young child.",1

"This is the best book for someone who is not familiar with Ken Wilber's writings. I'm under the opinion that everyone should open their doors enough to let this book in. it will probably bring you to read many more, if not all of his other works. (Which are plenty) Ken Wilber goes so in depth and addresses those things you thought only you thought about. He has a way of turning you inside out to look at yourself. It personally helped me alot and he is now my favorite author. Although this is a review for the author, I would recomend this book for anyone who wants to see what this author is about",1
"This is the book I wanted to write! There are many books out there around this subject, but this text is comprhensive AND comprehensible! It covers every area of the post production process ( and a good deal of giudance for the recording of production sound too) in exactly the amount of detail that is needed, with each technical topic supported by useful and informative technique and advice. The chapters on editing sound give many valuable pointers that will help anyone who is learniung this craft to develop a strong skills base, with really useful practical tips. There is  no important technical information missing; all the standards and formats are addressed and explained in easy to read language, so that you're not left with an incomplete picture, and it's up to date with contemporary systems such as Windows XP and Mac OSX, hard disk recording and digital TV, DVD, diffusion systems for broadcast (surround) and more.So to sum up, this is a really good read, and worth having as a reference book for anyone studying or working in this field who wants to get a a good understanding of the entire process of audio post, and I would also recommend it to film makers as well, as it is a good read and will inform and enlighten.I have included it my essential reading list for students on our film and sound design courses",1

He seriously contributed to literature and also made it accessible for all interested without being lofty, pretentious or purposefully obtuse",1
"not much can be said about kind of blue that hasn't been said before - especially in all these reviews.  it is, without question, the quinesentail jazz album.  with legendary  players bill evans, paul chambers, and jimmy cobb laying down the foundation for the incomparable horns of davis, john coltrane, and cannonball adderly  its not surprising this is a masterpiece.  but there's lots of great groupings on lots of great albums in jazz, and this is by no means the first.  it is, however, one of the most seamless and tight groupings of exceptionally skilled musicians as you'll ever find.  i purchased this album at least 10 years ago and i've listened to it countless times, quite literally, and its not rare that it sends shivers up my spine to this day.  every song deserves accolades, but 'all blues' and 'freddie freeloader' are my personal favorites.  'all blues' is one of my all time favorite pieces of music, jazz or otherwise.   if you like kind of blue i'd recomend:somethin' else - cannonball adderly - similar grouping to kind of blue - no coltrane, and miles taking a lesser role, but very similar feel.  not perfection, but unquestionably an excellent album",0

The front section on making stocks is very helpful as it includes not only the standard vegetable, chicken and meat stocks, but also fish stock and stocks for Chinese and Japanese cooking.Each recipe comes with beautiful end-result pictures as well as pictures of some of the steps involved. The directions are clear and simple. Many of the recipes come with suggestions for variations and all of the vegetarian selections are marked. Most of the soups use easy-to-find ingredients, but the exceptions often have tips on where to find the unfamiliar items. I've tried several of the recipes with no problems and delicious results. One of my personal favorites is the Tomato and Blue Cheese Soup. I'm looking forward to cooking and eating my way through these soups.",1
"This is indeed a large pot, but I have found it extremely useful and use it at least once a week.  I didn't want a large number of pots and pans, so I looked for versatile pieces.  We are just 2 in our household right now, but I bought this size mostly because it will be even more useful for the future - a family, company. I use it to cook many things that I start on the stovetop and finish in the oven.  For example, to brown chicken pieces on the stovetop, add herbs, ingredients, etc, and bake it in the oven.  The heavy tight fitting lid keeps the steam locked in and the food moist. I bake entire chickens in it when I am short on time (skin isn't very crispy, though)- it really cooks a whole 4-lb chicken in about half an hour at 450 degrees with the pot and oven preheated. Works great with chili, soups, beans, tomato-based sauces, even jams. The cast iron heats slow and holds heat in - I don't burn anything in this.  Clean-up is so easy",0

"BEHIND THE SCENES WITH COUNT OLAF appears to be the typical behind the scenes movie book. However, once you begin reading the pages and looking at the pictures, you realize it's not. The whole concept behind the book is that Count Olaf has ""edited"" the original BEHIND THE SCENES BOOK. The dialogue that is supposed to go with the pictures is often covered over what appears to be scratches of paper and tape that are written on, explaining what Count Olaf wants you to know. It's a cute sight gag, usually only seen in books for young children. However, for anyone who knows anything about THE SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS, you know that the gimmick fits perfectly into the general tone and theme of the books and upcoming movie. There are lots of photos from the film and a few surprises for those who haven't seen the movie yet and who have only read the books. So, why don't you make your uncle Olaf proud and buy this book",1

A must for the serious investor. A concise and easy to understand examination of technical market indicators.  Mr. Colby's book is invaluable when determining the usefulness of indicators.  This book is about as close as you can get to a &quot;one stop shop&quot; for technical research,1
"The second book of the Alexandrian Quartet mirrors all the happenings in the first, only this time from Balthazar's perspective.  Beautifully written, this books gives the characters more depth than the naive and  intellectual Darley first perceived.  Here the complexities of love and  obsession are seen in the light of curiosity, not rationalism",1
"There are countless books about the 60s, but only a few which really capture the feeling of limitless possibilities & potential as we experienced it then. This is one of those books, written by someone who was there on the inside, participating & observing in delight & wonder ... & perhaps a litle bit of bemused trepidation, too. For younger generations, the 60s are often just a flashy mass of superficial cliches, co-opted by commercial culture & stripped of any deeper meaning. Derek Taylor reminds us that it was a period of yearning, of searching, of exploration ... and yes, sometimes youthful folly. But that was part of the journey, for as William Blake told us nearly two centuries before, ""If the fool would persist in his folly, he would become wise.""What's especially enjoyable about this book is that it covers a lot of ground that gets overlooked by the usual 30-second clips & sound bites of this era. The London poetry scene, the synergy in the arts -- it's all here, with tidbits of unexpected information. For example, the Beatles mulling the possibility of starring in a film adaptation of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" with Paul as Frodo, Ringo as Sam, George as Gandalf, and John as Gollum? Could there have been better casting? :)Such was the colorful, absurdly wonderful reality of that brief moment in time, when it truly seemed possible to tear down the ""dark, Satanic mills"" & build a better world. It must seem utterly unreal & impossible to a younger generation, but yes, the everyday world wasn't always such a dark, cynical, despairing place ... and maybe it offers hope that we can outlive these current bleak times & eventually build something better one day.Definitely recommended",1
"Great book: well-written, focused, straightforward, no-nonsense tone, lots of good advise based on experience.  Just an adviso: there are a lot of new websites and/or organizations advertising seminars and workshops on the new publishing era.  Save yourself a lot of money and read this book instead.  If you are a self-starter, it will also get you more pro-active.  Rosenthal lays out the blueprint, but it's up to your own creativity to mold it the way you want.  There are lots of 'experts' now offering workshops (really pep talks) on how to do the print on demand route.  If they were so successful on their own, however, why would they need to advertiste their seminars",1
"The book was wonderful !  As a Philadelphia Phillies fan, I'm used to disappointments...so I didn't know what to expect when dealing with a book on baseball stats to use for my computer league picks.

"This is arguably John-Maynard Smith's most challenging project in popular science writing. Written along with Eros Szathmary, a chemist, &quot; The Major Transitions in Evolution&quot; is written primarily for biology  students, but can be understood by anybody with a solid background in  evolutionary theory.  How have the ways in which information is transmitted  between generations changed through time and what were the crucial  transitions that made these changes possible? One early example that  illustrates the effect of these transitions is the origin of chromosomes.  Nucleic acid strands (genes) capable of independent replication, at some  point became linked and thereafter could replicate only as a set of lined  genes (chromosomes). A new way of storing information,a new information  system had evolved. How was this transition maintained through time?  Would'nt unlinked genes which replicate faster be favoured by natural  selection over linked genes? In effect, would'nt selection at a lower level  disrupt higher level organizatins? This is a common feature of many of the  major transitions and forms the fundamental theme of this marvellous book.   In a series of chapters the authors discuss the evolutions of various level  of complexity. The chapters are arrange in a logical sequence begining with  the origin of life and moving on to successive transitions including the  origin of the genetic code, the origin of the eucaryotes, the origin of  sex, multicellularity, societies and language. The list here is not  complete. I read the book from start to finish in a sequence, but readers  with a good background in the subject could probably start anywhere  depending on their interest. For non-biologist this is not easy reading at  all, and I would imagine that even biology students will find portions  challenging. An impressive quality of this book is the constant attempt to  incorporate the pecularities of a particular system in developing an  explanation to explain its origin. A discussion on the origin of the  genetic code includes the possibilty that there could be a stero-chemical  basis for specific amino acid-codon assigments, rather than it being a  'frozen accident'. Another example is whether there is a causal connection  between haplodiploidy and evolution of sociality in eusocial insects. The  author warn against making this apparently intuitive connection, and  instead seek an explanation in split sex ratios and in some cases the  particular features of insect ecology. The highlight of the book for me was  the last chapter on the origin of language. From Noam Chomsky's work on the  structure of grammer , syntax and language and representation, to an  evolutionary explanation for its origin, this was really an informative  essay. The ever recurring argument against the evolution of complex  adapatations, in this case language, by a series of adaptive intermediate  stages, has been dealt with using examples from animal speech, the genetics  of language disorders and a section on the transitions from pigdin to  creole.  The book strikes a good balance between explaining theory and then  discussing the experimental evidence available. Wherever possible, new  experimental approaches are suggested. Finally, like any really good book  on science the authors not only bring you up to date with what has been  done, but also stress just how much more needs to be done. It is this  feature about the book that leaves a lasting impression",1
I like these pads because they are thicker and larger than other brand pads.  This makes it very convenient when you have more than one puppy or dog. ,0
" I bought a hard back copy of this book a long time ago. I made tea out of a few of the suggested herbs, and they worked.  I bought a softback copy for my mother-in-law.  She made tea out of a few of the suggested herbs, and they worked.  I believe that this book is a very good book for those who seriously want to make natural home remedies.Thank You",1

"I have owned a Maverick EC-200 for about eighteen months and have been very pleased with it.The EC-200 holds 7 eggs in shell and 4 in the poaching tray.It comes with a combination measuring cup/egg piercer.  The measuring cup has markings for every combination of doneness (soft/medium/hard) and number of eggs (1-7).  Cooking time depends on amount of water used.The alarm is steady ""chirp"" that gets your attention.I have hard-boiled at least 300 eggs with this cooker and the alarm has never failed.  A cycle for 7 hard-boiled eggs is around eighteen minutes, but I have never timed a cycle since I listen for the alarm.This unit is NOT designed for unattended cooking.  The unit does not turn itself off after the alarm sounds, so you need to be there.  Instructions say to rinse eggs in cold water to stop the cooking process, but I usually just turn off the unit and remove the lid to let the steam out",0

"I've had a good hour or so to sit and read through ""Understanding Open Source & Free Software Licensing, by Andrew M. St. Laurent (Oreilly 2004 - ISBN: 0596005814) and thought I would share my opinion on it.Let me first begin by saying that the author did a great job of being concise.  I'd had some free time today, and was at first hesitant to begin, as I thought it may be too dry for a saturday afternoon.  St. Laurent did a great job of reeling me in though, with a quick, easy to understand example of basic copyright as it stands in the US, along with brief explanations on how closed-source and open-source licensing influences that copyright.The book then goes into different types of open source/free software licensing: GPL, LGPL, Apache, Qt, Creative Commons, BSD, etc - all of the usual suspects, and then some.  Then, in chapter 5, the author talks about ""Closed Source"" licensing, for the reason being that ""understanding proprietary licenses can also be important, as companies...(are) attempting to reap some of the benefits of a more open development model.""Chapters 6 and 7 get to the heart of the matter, discussing the legal aspects, derived works and forking of OS projects, choosing a license and even the ""negative"" aspects of OS licensing.I would say that the author deserves your hard-earned sheckles for this book.  He does a good job of delivering a widely debated, legal topic to the folks who need to understand it the most, software developers and their IT collegues",1
"Dr. John belts these tunes out with so much feeling!  Didn't know too much about the Dr. before I bought Gumbo, but this disc is like a tour of New Orleans... &quot;Iko Iko&quot;, &quot;Big Chief&quot;, &quot;Junko Partner&quot;, &quot;Stack-A-Lee&quot;, &quot;Tipitina&quot;!!!  Fantasitic piano playing that makes you think they had a blast just recording the album.  In the liner notes the Dr. refers to &quot;Gumbo&quot; as blues and stomp music with a touch of dixieland jazz.  Take a listen to &quot;Blow Wind Blow&quot; and his amazing cover of Fess' &quot;Tipitina&quot;, and you'll see why that description pretty much sums it up",0
"I bought these for my 13-year old niece, who loves percussion, and was so excited to get them for Christmas. They looked like a great buy.Well, the disappointment was palpable two hours later. We got them hooked up, installed appropriate batteries etc., and the light was on, but we could not get any sound from the drumsticks at all. Which was a bummer, but OK, if we could simply either (1) get help or (2) easily replace them.Nope.  The ""instructions"" were a tiny folded sheet of paper, there is absolutely no troubleshooting, no help, no nothing.  I went through everything that came with them but could find anything to help us on next steps or returns, etc.  I finally retrieved the original plastic packaging and found a URL in tiny letters for the company. But when I went there, the site again offered no help, tips, or troubleshooting (just a PDF of the really awful original instructions). There is video on the website showing someone playing the drumsticks but this was no help to us in trying to troubleshoot (except to mildly disappoint my niece when she realized that you have to drum ""in the air"" to get the best results -- which we did try, with no luck or sound, again).I next e-mailed the company and got no response. I e-mailed them again and -- seven days later -- the e-mail (in badly worded English) simply asked me if we had tried ""plugging in the head phones."" Seriously.Anyway, do NOT waste your money. A terrible product, no support, and no recourse if it doesn't work as it should",0
This is a great thriller. Hard to put down,1
"Barry just knows how to get into the psyche of kids, adolescents, anyone under the age of 17, it seems.  This book is a quick read, but a delicious one.  Barry writes her characters' voices in as understated and realistic pieces of life, and she does what she's so good at doing: she puts readers in a space in which they're none too comfortable, and yet they can't seem to shake the familiar feelings of their own childhood horrors and experiences.  This book is unsettling and slightly worrisome, and also truthful and wonderful, just as children often are",1
"This book is different than many mythology texts, it is a good read.  The stories are more like stories, and they carry on from one story or chapter to the next.  It holds the attention",1
"I have just finished reading this book for the third time. My first reading, in the fall of 2003, convinced me to switch our family to raw milk.Since that time, the health of my three children has increased dramatically. In particular, my middle child's bone density increased from the 50th percentile to the 84th-99th percentiles (depending on the bone). Although bone density is not normally measured in children, a spate of broken arms, along with a lucky coincidence, colluded to having his bone density measured just before we switched to raw milk (at age 5), and again 3 years later (at age 8).I firmly believe that this book should be required reading for every pediatrician. It is a masterpiece, beautifully written, thoroughly researched, and truely deserving of more recognition than it has received",1
