"At 6 1/2 months old my baby isn't walking yet, but when we go out I put these on her feet with our without shoes. She moves her legs a lot and usually kicks off any shoes and socks on. These stay on better than any we've tried. She can't pull them off easily. They are holding up very well in the wash and the colors match the colors used in baby's outfits on the market - which is very nice. The ""non-slip"" part is the printing on the bottom of the feet that says ""Loveable Friends"". It is a soft rubberish kind of printing that feels very nice to the fingers. We started using these when our baby had just turned 5 months old and they stayed on just as well then. They seem like they will fit her for another few months. Overall these are very nice socks for a good price. I highly recommended them.",0,1,5.865005488955577e-44
"These shoes were exactly what I was looking for. I was worried after reading previous customer reviews that these shoes run small/narrow because I have a wide foot. However, they fit perfectly. The straps are feminine and the gold sole provides just enough glitz. And with a retail price of $105, how can you beat this great deal?",0,1,3.49938345269442e-53

I use a bunch of athletic shoes and I find that Asics Gel Nimbus is the pair I pick most of the time. These are light and incredibly 'springy' shoes that provide the right amount of cushion. These are much superior in my opinion to NB and Saucony.The price is the one thing I am not happy about but all manufacturers are the same in terms of pricing for specialized shoes,0,1,0

"I read other people's reviews before ordering this little bag. I sniffed it when it arrived and it does have a certain odor to it. After smelling it, I believe it to smell alot like some of the clothes that arrive packaged from overseas etc. I was told at the last clothing store I worked in that the smell is from a spray that is used to kill any insects that like to eat the material used for clothing, purses and the like. I do not find it offensive at all and the smell does disappear overnight.The bag is adorable and very chic!",0,1,5.31341417394081e-66

"We used Avent with our 1st baby and loved it. Now that we are expecting another munchkin, we planning on using them again. I loved these. I loved how simple it made it to store my milk. Straight from the Isis Pump to my fridge/freezer. Simple. Yes, the defrosting takes longer than some alternatives, but I always had a bottle in the fridge while one was defrosting. I found warming it in a boiling pot of water to work the best for quick defrost. They do take up more room than the bags when storing, but I think the convience outweighed that problem. I stored milk in the fridge and freezer and learned to rotate so room wasn't a terrible problem. (If you do this, it is important to label and date the containers) This also saved me from defrosting last minute. I had some leaking issues from time to time, but figured it out. If you tighten the container/bottle too much it will leak. Simple fix...don't over-tighten. (Avent's site has a short trouble shooting list for leakage problems) We tried other products, but Avent was the best for our family.",0,1,2.70722420082084e-62
"I absolutely LOVE this pump. It is fast and effective and I get way more milk with this pump than I did with any other that I tried. Also-- these things are expensive so shop around so you don't overpay. I got mine from a private practice LC at Add A Little Love.com and got not only the pump at a great price, but the owner helped me with the issues I was having. Bottom line - the pump is great but only if you have someone to help and support you too",0,1,4.730525354957438e-31
"I bought this toy for my 6-month old son to grow into over the next year because it seemed to offer a variety of ways to learn and play. When putting it together Christmas morning the pieces did not snap together securely and kept falling off. Also, one light does not work. The poor construction of this toy is disappointing coming from Fischer-Price. I will be returning (not exchanging) this toy. Luckily my son is young enough that he will not miss it",0,1,3.6959055546076346e-31

"I ordered the 30-day supply of the Murad Acne Complex--just to see what it was all about. I have always had oily skin and those little bumps on my forehead--but my biggest problem was blackheads on my cheeks/nose and those painful red bumps that always show up when I shave. After only a week or so of being on the Acne Complex, I IMMEDIATELY noticed a reduction in the post-razor bumps as well as the little red bumps on my forehead. And the refining mask is AMAZING! Let it sit on your face for 10 minutes and you'll be amazed at how it makes blackheads DISAPPEAR. Plus, Murad's formula doesn't have any of that drying benzoyl peroxide, which means no irritation, no drying, and no bleaching the collars of your expensive shirts. If you've got acne problems, you owe it to yourself to give Acne Complex a try",0,0.9999999883373023,1.1662697645703565e-08
"Ok, if you weren't already aware, blotting papers are merely the same material you use to separate your bum and the public toilet. However, I am not inclined to stuff a few seat covers in my purse. Sephora has put their blotting papers on a mini roller in an attractive light blue container. This is better than other packaging options, where the too small papers are offered in kleenix-box style. Sephora's rolling sheet option allows you to take as much as you need, and offers an efficient cutting edge for easy tearing. Now that's what I'm talking about",0,1,1.287325594543376e-31

"If the woman on the cover of this book looks familiar, that's because you've probably seen her in one of countless fitness magazines, sporting a winning smile and a fabulous figure. I used to read some hardcore fitness magazines until I realized that the women featured in them had made working out their lives...and I wasn't ever going to go that far. I used to marvel at the strict regimin of low fat, high protein mini meals coupled with intense daily workouts. Being an on-again-off-again raw vegan for years, I used to wonder what they would say about strength training and the raw diet. Well, now there's someone doing it! When national fitness competitor, model, and personal trainer Kathy Feldman was diagnosed with hypothyroidism causing excessive weight gain, she began looking for new answers to her diet and exercise regimin. She discovered raw foods and learned that she no longer had to over-exercise to keep her lean and strong physique. Kathy recommends an 80% raw diet consisting of fresh juices with Vitamineral Green for breakfast followed by fresh fruits; an early afternoon snack, one of her delicious Raw Crunch Bars; a mid afternoon salad; another Raw Crunch Bar in the late afternoon; and your dinner of choice (cooked). She highly recommends vegan eating, but this is not a strict, boring diet, and it will definitely appeal to the average eater of the Standard American Diet (SAD). Kathy keeps it simple; this book is short and sweet and explains all the basics of eating raw without getting too deeply into the details of nutrition for those who are anxious to get straight to the information about transforming their bodies. Her background in cellular biology combined with an easy-going writing style make this petite diet manual a real plus to the field of fitness and nutrition. Like Fit for Life, which helped countless people change their eating habits back in the 80s, this book will appeal to anyone wanting to transition to raw foods or just incorporate more raw foods in the diet without going to extremes. But let me tell you, the real kicker here is that the diet includes her Raw Crunch Bars, which are just to die for. I'm totally addicted.",1,5.577557521088239e-68,1
I found this book to be full of practical guidance about how to use storytelling more effectively in business settings.

"I became engrossed in this book from the minute I started reading it. Ms.O'Connor has that uncanny knack of being able to write insightfully about both men and women, and as I grew to know them intimately and experience their emotions and passions, I found myself deeply rooting for each of them. Their attitudes towards the theatre and towards each other kept growing and changing -- always with a wit underneath that was enormously appealing.

"Wolfgang Lotz's Architecture in Italy, 1500-1600 is a wonderful introduction and survey of the majesty of Italian Renaissance Architecture. I had the privilage of studying under Richard Tuttle who is recognized in the introduction, who showed me the brilliance of Lotz's work as well as his ability to show the beauty of architecture. This book is a must for any serious academic student or architectural enthusiast. Lotz's presentation of Italian Architecture is a continuation of Ludwig Heydenreich's Architecture in Italy, 1400-1500, and when read together is certainly the definitive work on Renaissance Architecture. The marvelous pictures and diagrams are the best published images I have come across",1,3.0889995146509564e-06,0.9999969110004854

"Albert Goldman, the author of this book is on one level, a brilliant writer......But, his entire slant toward John Lennonis negative...and he seems jealous of John Lennon.. he has mad jealousy!!!That's the only conclusion I can come to here... and In the end, I really don't think this can be considered an autobiography of Lennon becausewhatever objectivity Goldman does retain is overshadowed by his gross subjective generalized reasoning...So it's a bathroom trashy, somewhat fictionalized account of John Lennon and it's one of the mostentertaining things I've ever read... and I love John and Yoko even more afterhaving read it... it makes you become obsessed with their myth..",1,3.840332459925751e-61,1

"I thought the book was very good. Anderson's background contributed to that. He is a scholar, having taught Islamic law in England for many years, but he also takes an evangelical approach, which is helpful for Christians with traditional backgrounds. He also refutes many of the better known pluralists (Hicks, Cantwell, etc.), and helps the average person better understand the whole issue. This issue is extremely important to the church. Anderson discusses such questions as: Is Christianity unique? Can one be saved by any other name but Jesus? and so forth. This is a good book to read about this important subject and while meaty it is not too hard for most lay people to read and get something out of it",1,2.188966932390205e-44,1

"This is by far the best book in the subject, as one can see surfing through the sites of CA courses in several universities around the world. The most important feature of the book is the well founded exposition. With the book it is possible to understand why the designers of modern computers take the decisions that we read in the processor reports. Every decision is based in performance measures and good cost-benefit relation. The book emphasizes this point of view. Every thing must be measured in order to take the right decision. Also this is the reason because several more recent books are not bestsellers as this book in a field where the time is very important, the principles remains. However I hope a new edition sonner.

"I thought this biography was detailed mostly around this film. On page 262, first paragraph, I think Mr. Coppola would agree to mention the fact that &quot;The Chief Phillips&quot; made a life last attempt to end Willard after getting speared on the boat by Kurtz's mongrules. Overall, the book was a manificant biography of a Itailian-American film maker of our time",1,2.680990072670506e-57,1
"This one is awesome. I followed the series of Inspector Banks books from In A Dry Season onward and this one is probably the best so far.Part of the reason is that the protagonist, Alan Banks got fixed pretty good in the previous book -Playing With Fire. This story starts with him still recovering from all the psychological and physical wounds that he had incurred previously. You follow along with his struggles through his attempt at coming back to a place where he can be normal again, as well as the rebuilding of his home as well as his relationships with his co-workers, especially with Annie Cabbot. The story then forces him to re-establish or re-evaluate his relationsip with his younger brother, the evidence of the their relationship had been hinted at throughout the previous books, but this book places the relationship front and center.Robinson once again uses his signature plot device: the dual story and the intertwining of the twin narratives. Whereas previously Robinson used this device to tell two stories which are related in a philosophical sense, this time the two murders are intimately related and inextricably become the same investigation. Robinson builds the plot line and the tempo of the narrative brilliantly. This time, he is a little more guarded with his storyline so that he doesn't telegraph the ending as much as he did with Playing With Fire, which makes for a much more satisfying ending. This particular will be my personal favorite out of the series so far just because it involves so many emotional changes with the characters and the story line is so personal for Banks. Robinson has also started to flesh out the other detectives at Eastvale, giving them points of views, foiles, strengths and weaknesses. It makes me care a lot more about the story and it also makes the story much more complicated and real",1,2.680990072670506e-57,1
"What can you say about a book that introdouces three characters in one chapter? Or has a character thats entire vocabulary seems to consist of ""Hotcha, Gotcha"" and says that nearly 10 times a chapter. I would honestly not care if all the people upped and died. This book has no surprises but one, a ""plot twist"" that was obvious 6 chapters away. Did I mention I hate the annoying, underdeveloped, characters. Oh yes. I usually like Bruce Coville, but with this book, he has bought himself to a level of unreadability that is only outclassed by the sequel",1,4.236083546170892e-31,1
"I purchased this book two years ago and read it through, but it didn't impact me very much. I just pulled it out again to reread and was deeply moved by the author's conviction about the spiritual nature of life. Even if one has strong spiritual convictions, it is all too easy to compartmentalize work, family, friends, and spiritual life. Bolles reminded me of the &quot;integrity&quot; of integrated life and work. Although it is very short, this book should not be a quick read, rather, it is something to meditate on",1,4.3664867250072034e-66,1

"Gary Smalley was obviously a horrible husband in the early years of his marriage to a wonderful woman. He later repented, and now he assumes that all women are wonderful and all men are horrible. In the edition of this book that I read, he relates telling an adulterous wife that her affair was completely her husband's fault. Quite frankly, I am offended that Gary Smalley has the unmitigated gall to call himself a Christian.If you are a wife who wants to find many ways to blame all problems on your husband, this is the book for you. However, if you want to have a Godly, fulfilling marriage, try ""His Needs, Her Needs"" by Willard Harley",1,1.2844789566157199e-107,1

"Soil organisms seldom get their due. Despite the fact that we gain our food directly or indirectly from the soil, few people think much about what exists between the soil particles. In fact the soil is so full of living things that it could almost be considered to be alive itself. If an alien spacecraft landed on almost any soil surface on earth it would find recognizable life processes without much trouble, but then our planet may be a bit weird (at least as weird as Mars or Saturn's moon Titan!).David W. Wolfe has presented a very readable and fascinating view of the soil and its biota in his book ""Tales from the Underground."" From soil microorganisms (some not so ""friendly"") through earthworms to prairie dogs, the reader it treated to a broad panorama of life. It is now suspected that the number of species in the soil (and even into the rocky crust) may be larger than for that on the surface. E. O. Wilson has said that if he were to have another career it would be in the ecology of the microorganisms in tropical soils, and I think he is on to something.Sadly, there are relatively few soil biologists. Specialists in, for example, earthworms (creatures that as Darwin noted are largely responsible for the development of humus in the temperate parts of the world), are few and far between as noted by Ehrenfeld in his book ""Beginning Again."" Yet our crops, and thus our very life on this planet, depend on such soil-forming organisms.I once visited a citrus grove in Florida where nearly every chlorinated hydrocarbon known to man had been used against the ever present insect pests. It was a spooky place. The soil itself could be used as a pesticide and there were, as far as I could ascertain, no ants or spiders. While I was there I heard no birds singing. All of these observations were certainly odd as in every other grove I had ever visited both ants and spiders were common and bird song could be heard periodically. The only living creatures I found were earwigs! Thousands of them existed under the leaf litter. Apparently resistant to the DDT, chlordane, toxophene, aldrin and dialdrin that had been used on the grove, they had proliferated beyond belief. Human activities such as this, as noted by Wolfe, need to be mitigated if we are to have a sustainable society. We cannot think of nature as something to conquer. His last chapter ""The Good Earth"" should be read by anyone who has a stake in solving the problems that may lead to our demise as a species- and that means all of us! Still Wolfe points out that we have to be ""conditional optimists"" to progress. Pessimistic despair will get us nowhere and ""pathological optimism"" has gotten us to this point. Perhaps it is a time for moderation in our thinking, while knowing that we may have to make some drastic changes in our attitudes to get anywhere! It is certainly unfortunate that several current governments are still in the ""pathological optimism"" mode, but then facing unpleasant facts is always hard! However, many national and international corporations, the World Bank and a number of insurance agencies are taking the threat seriously. After all they will certainly be affected by such drastic changes that may be in the offing. They cannot afford the head-in-the-sand thinking that politicians seem to need to get re-elected.Read this book- it will change your attitude about the dirt we walk on and from which we probably originated",1,2.6902352520526334e-30,1

"""If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man,"" Hemingway wrote, ""then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast."" For this reason, in 1995, New Yorker ""Paris Journals"" columnist, Adam Gopnik, and his wife, Martha, moved to Paris so that their son, Luke, could grow up ""someplace where everything he sees is beautiful"" (p. 167). M. F. K. Fisher observed in her book, THE GASTRONOMICAL ME, that Paris ""should always be seen, the first time, with the eyes of childhood or of love."" In the 23 essays and journal entries that constitute PARIS TO THE MOON, Gopnik's best writing occurs when he is describing Paris through the experiences of his young son, though as a whole, the book may be read as an intimate memoir of Gopnik's five-year (1995-2000) love affair with The City of Lights--its cafs, brasseries, and shops, the aesthetics of the carousel in Luxembourg Gardens (in striking contrast to the stupidity of Barney on American television), and the never-ending, small moments that that infuse his life in Paris with profound meaning. During his tryst, however, Gropnik also learns that Paris can be difficult mistress. For instance, he recalls the frustrations he encountered upon joining a French health club, and in attempting to purchase a Thanksgiving turkey during a 1995 strike. While he offers no apologies for mooning sentimentally over his subject, Gropnik never loses his objective, journalist's eye in writing about his subject. Equally funny and intelligent, Gopnik's observations will not only appeal to readers of the New Yorker magazine, but to anyone interested in French culture, cuisine, and bureaucracy. G.

"I read this book for the 1st time right after I became a new Christian almost 20 years ago. It changed my life. The title that Melody used for this book perfectly described Keith Green's heart. He made many mistakes and was often over zealous in his faith, but what inspired me the most was his complete trust in God at all costs. He gave up the opportunity to be rich and famous according to the world's standards, and in turn became rich and famous according to God's standards. I recently read this book again and cried so hard I couldn't breathe. Not so much for Keith & his family, but for myself, that I wish that I had even a fraction of the faith and zeal that Keith had.",1,4.996231913059994e-28,1

"When I first started reading this book, I thought it was good but lacked a little in detail. It skimmed over some parts when discussing various events the band experienced. At first, I thought this was because so much has been written about these before. But as I read on, it appears more that the author either didn't do his research, or didn't do enough of it. When it comes to Kurt's experiences with Courtney, no mention is made of Courtney's actions, leaving the reader to believe Kurt was always at fault. Also, it glossed over the heartbreak Kurt suffered when Frances was taken away and what they both went through to get her back. Considering what an impact this had on all three of them, the lack of information is questionable, at best. He also never mentions the fact that the doctor who treated Kurt during the Rome incident said there was no evidence Kurt had swallowed ANY, let alone 50, Rohynols. He simply goes by Courtney's comments around this event. When it comes down to Kurt's death, not only does the author always refer to it as a suicide, which has not been 100% proven to many people, but he gets his 'facts' wrong. Kurt was not disfigured so badly that he could only be identified by his fingerprints. He did not barricade himself in the greenhouse; the stool in front of the back door - where there was no way of gaining entry as it was a balcony - was a small barstool that couldn't block anything even if someone could scale the balcony. Kurt's wallet wasn't lying open next to his body; a policeman stated HE had opened the wallet and put it there when they were taking pictures. Also, Wendy didn't make the missing person's police report; Courtney has admitted that she called the police pretending to be Wendy. The author states that Wendy, Courtney, and Krist decided where Kurt's ashes would be spread. As far as anyone knows, besides Courtney, some of Kurt's ashes were made into several tsatsas by monks in Ithaca, NY, some were buried under a tree at the Lake Washington house (both of these according to Courtney), and some were allegedly spread on the Wishkah River. No one really knows what happened to Kurt's ashes, except for Courtney. When one looks at these items the author either didn't include, or made major mistakes about, it makes it hard to take any of the rest of the book as truth. While it's a good read - at least the first part of it - there are many other books out there about Kurt that are much better",1,4.772085862205045e-75,1

"This is an easily accessible, short and reasonably thorough introduction to the subject of risk. The authors touch on almost every dimension of the topic, including financial risk, operational risk, reputation risk, governance risk and even the risk of terrorist attack. The book might have been quite a bit shorter and somewhat more focused on corporate management if the authors, KPMG vice chairs Mary Pat McCarthy and Timothy P. Flynn had tightened their anecdotes about anti-terrorist preparations at the Olympic Games. However, they seem to have believed that they would lose readers unless they provided a few entertaining distractions, and they could be right. Though it breaks little new ground, it plows the old ground interestingly. We recommend this portable summary of useful information to the CEOs and board members who are its intended audience, as well as to anyone responsible for risk management",1,2.8690869375481947e-62,1
"This is another great book in the Joanna Brady series by J.A. Jance. This time she throws a little romance into the mix of things as Brianna O'Brien is found murdered and her Hispanic boyfriend is the main suspect for some, while others don't believe he could kill. This teenage girl had many secrets and her boyfriend was only one of them. While investigating this crime, everyone's favorite female sheriff, Joanna Brady, uncovers more than she bargained for and has a difficult time in dealing with some of it. Again, we see some of the cast of support characters return, but others are mentioned in passing, so we know they will be back in future tomes. We're given a little glimpse of what's in store for Joanna Brady with her daughter growing up quickly and her mother's new relationship that seems to have transposed some of the former anger and has made her almost approachable.I find it interesting that Jance not only tells a wonderful story, but throws in a moral issue as well. She deals with the topic of racism in this book and does so in a very civilized way showing the prejudices of some and the extremes they will go to continue that narrow-mindedness. However, she also gives us hope for the future. She shows us that no matter what the odds some will not follow in their parents' beliefs and will, instead, have friends based on things other than the color of skin or social standing.And along with the story line and moral issue, you can always rely on Jance to paint a mental picture of the Arizona desert at it's best. Having lived in Arizona, I can remember the millions of stars in the sky that Jance describes in detail. I can remember the rugged beauty of the various wilderness areas that are similar to those portrayed. No one gives a better mental image of these things than Jance does. Having read all of the books in this series, I feel like I've actually been to Bisbee, Arizona. I'm sure if I ever do get the chance to visit that town; I'll see things as I've seen them before in my mind while reading these novels.After reading the first book in the Joanna Brady series, I didn't think Jance would be able to keep up with the standard she set. I was very mistaken. She has not only achieved that level of excellence but has surpassed it and continues to set new standards with each new book she writes.I highly recommend not only SKELETON CANYON, but any and all books in this series. They're wonderful, exciting and highly addicting! I do suggest that you read them in order to get the background on the characters - it's not mandatory, but will make for a more enjoyable read and will let your imagination run wild with possible scenarios for the future!",1,1.5848393015460656e-46,1

"Even if only the tip of the iceberg, Nicolle's work is certainly enjoyable for readers with only a casual interest in the subject. Despite its title, this book deals not particularly with the Huns, but with the Turco-Mongol nomads of Central Asia in general (the author adds in the forest peoples of Siberia). The influence that these hardy horsemen of the steppes had on military science and even chivalry was staggering. These people, it would seem, practically invented warfare. Even the oath on the sword taken by European knights was apparently borrowed from the nomad Turks. Nicolle's general discussion is followed by profiles of the nomad groups between the Huns and Genghis Khan (Kipchaks, Bulgars, Seljuks, Karakhanids), including cultural details (they were no mere barbarians). The color drawings were beautiful and intricate, right down to the tiny brass bells decorating the Turkic warrior's spear. Overall, it's a colorful and fascinating introduction to the nomads of Central Asia",1,1.5392105452030117e-91,1

You can't stay locked up in your house to aviod these people who have such hate against people that mayb be a different, or not as ""perfect"" as them.

"This book is a must-have! It's a great conversation piece for get togethers. When I read my birthday I was amazed at how the analogy applied to me. I bring it to work once or twice a year for people to read about themselves, their children, spouses, etc. Most are awed at the accurate depiction illustrated of themselves or loved ones born on a certain day. The only people that have picked up my book and denied the accuracy of what the book depicted were people whose personalities were negative. When I read their birthday personality I felt the book was right on about them. It described their negative and maybe vindictive personality which I saw in these people. The negative/pessimistic personalities that read about themselves denied any truth to what they read because they don't want to accept who they are. I have read numerous birthday personalities for my spouse, my children, relatives, friends and acquaintances and found this book to be very accurate. I feel it's a must-have.

"&quot;Becoming Mae West&quot; is simply the best book written about the star because it is focused and meticulously researched, employing primary sources when available. Ms Leider's book has the authority without sacrificing readability; the author writes well. The fascinating part of West's life is how she cobbled together an act and a personality that is an amalgam of Police Gazette melodrama, the comic camp of female impressionist Bert Savoy, and the daring sexual style and musical sense of the great African American blues women. Mae West's sense of possibilities allowed her to transform herself from a pudgy Jewish/Irish girl with more guts than talent into a blond sex symbol of amazonian proportions (okay, she used six inch platform shoes) who refined the rough soubrette type into a witty American icon. Emily Leider tells this story well. For those who wanted the dirt on West's declining decades, Ms. Leider sketches it in to complete the tale. But as Leider warns the reader, it was the act of Becoming Mae West that prompted her to write this book, not the effort of a woman entrapped by her creation to preserve it. Highly recommended",1,6.075056351573187e-28,1

"What a remarkable book, one with a fresh perspective toward the young adult novels that are assigned in middle school English classes. Barbara Feinberg's central question is, when and why did books for preteens get so grim? In an extended essay mixed with personal reflection, Feinberg examines the YA ""problem novel,"" the books that more or less began with Paul Zindel's ""The Pigman"" and which some librarians call ""Doom and Gloom"" books. The ""child"" protagonists in these novels face abuse, abandonment, incest, trauma, loss, and lots of death, as if the child needs to suffer and someone needs to die to make the child grow up, accept reality, and be a resilient, self-reliant survivor. In the meantime, most adults in these books are useless for helping the kids to cope, and imagination and play are completely sacrificed, as the kids in these books are expected to grow out of such hindrances.As the founder of a long-running children's program in New York called Story Shop, Feinberg knows and talks to real children and gives them places for play and imagination. In the book she also writes extensively about her children, 12-year-old Alex (the victim of this dismal school summer reading) and Clair, age 7. This gal knows and loves kids, and her book is an impassioned defense of childhood from an adult who has worked through her own issues.I heard a sermon several years ago by the Rev. Mary Harrington, a Unitarian Universalist minister and mother at the time of similar-aged children to Feinberg's, talking about environmental education programs for young children. In standard environmental education programs, children were given the message that the world was going to hell in a handbasket and they needed to save it. Interestingly, these children did NOT grow up into environmentalist adults. Instead, they became environmentally apathetic adults. The children who became environmentalists as adults were taken into nature and allowed to enjoy it, look at bugs, take hikes, NOT scared to death and given adult responsibilities to shoulder. As Rev. Harrington pointed out, children can't even make their parents recycle, much less can they save the world, and it is our duty as adults to take those actions, not foist it onto vulnerable, helpless children.Feinberg makes a similar point about the spate of young adult problem novels currently on schools' required reading lists. By and large, 12-year-olds hate them when they are required to read and analyze them in school. These books -- the same books they could love if they found them on their own at age 15 -- are depressing and demoralizing. Who are they trying to teach with these fake ""child"" narrators, who have an adult perspective in the guise of a child? Is it the adult's ""inner child,"" a wish to protect our lost child selves by giving our own ""past"" selves a context for the suffering of life, and also trying to toughen ourselves by toughening up the kids? If so, do the books they are required to read help the actual children, right now, or are they taking childhood away to reassure overwhelmed adults? I remember hating ""The Red Pony"" in 8th grade. They assigned this Steinbeck novel because it has a young protagonist and the pony dies. So it wasn't until years later that I tried Steinbeck again and was surprised to find that it wasn't all just Faulknerian trauma; why didn't they give us the fun Steinbeck novels to read, like ""Cannery Row""?Feinberg's sacred cows include the whole list of Newbery winners. I work in an independent bookstore, and when a 12-year-old comes in asking for a good book, I would never recommend ""Bridge to Terabithia,"" although author Katherine Paterson writes so beautifully; the book is just too stark and depressing, with a bleak and devastating surprise ending that gives only one chapter for resolution.The writing in ""Lizard Motel"" is lovely as well. Memoir is certainly more popular right now than educational theory for preteen readers, so I understand why she wrote the book this way. Teachers, librarians, booksellers, YA authors and readers, and parents should all consider Feinberg's perspective. Memoir writers can also take inspiration from her skillful weaving of personal history and essay.I'm rather sorry I've given 5-star book reviews so often, because when a book like this comes along, one wants to put in extra-credit stars! But this does have the distinction of being my 100th review for Amazon.com",1,6.288984691622311e-64,1

"Terrifying story of the dangers of the sea and the horrors of life on prison ships. Thank heavens I have never committed any of the crimes (or at least been caught) that would have doomed me to the punishment of being on a ship bound for Botany Bay.Mary Broad's story of ""Crime and Punishment"" is a vivid description of 18th century survival under the harshest conditions. Sealed into a filthy, animalistic hold of a ship and bound for halfway around the world to be imprisioned on the primative Botany Bay, Mary's life goes from bad to worse prompting a plan to escape via a small boat.With her husband and friends, Mary sets off to get anywhere but Botany Bay. Battered by weather that would have challenged the largest of ships, the little group of escaped convicts suffer hunger and thirst, lose sight of the coast, and find themselves in the open sea.Finally they drag into the harbor of Kupang where they are accepted and given the warmest of welcomes. Finally, for the first time in her life, Mary experiences pleasures of life that had always been out of her reach. But this dream-life comes to an end when the residents of Kupang realize that their new friends are escaped prisoners.Mary is turned over to the British and returned to England. Standing trial once again she is to be remanded to Newgate Prison -- it was new then -- but public sentiment moves the courts to determine that Mary has been punished enough and she is released. The rest of her life is spent quietly and she passes into history without any more notice.

"Excellent review of major events and social issues that have shaped the &quot;War in Drugs.&quot; While Baum is openly critical of our nation's policy, he backs his points with facts, rather than anecdotes. Unlike other authors in this genre, Baum does not portray the nation's leaders as purposely perpetrating evil on its citizens, knowingly perpetuating the War for their own benefit. Rather, he shows that underneath the utter failure of our drug control policy lies errors in judgement and poor political choices--foremost among them the choice to view drug addiction as a moral evil rather than a neuropsychiatric disease. Furthermore, Baum's scholarly, analytical tone prevents this book from seeming like most others: a bitter, indignant plea for marijuana legalization. An excellent excellent history and summary",1,2.336469962548314e-45,1
"I gave this a five-star rating not because ""I loved"" everything the contributors wrote but because it is a must read by anyone wanting to become truly conversant with emerging churches.So many books, reviews, blogs, and watch dog websites have created a caricature, a monolithic ""Emerging Church"" straw man. They then set their fictional creation ablaze to be warmed in their hearts as they discern the truth.The truth is, emerging churches are all over the theological spectrum and this book shows some of that spread in their own words.As a middle-aged evangelical who was raised in a thoroughly modern world, I find (a lot of) the beliefs and tactics described in this book to be encouraging. Not all post-moderns are sacrificing biblical truth on the altar of relativity. Most of the contributors show their belief in historical orthodox Christian doctrine. On the other hand, one contributor in particular shows a markedly lower view of the Scriptures - but he's being consistent since he shows a low view for written words in general. This is played out as he reads additional meanings into the writings of others (meanings that are far beyond the original intent) then attacks what he has added.Bottom line: regardless of your starting point, whether you see the emerging church as a new reformation or the great end-times apostasy, either way - if you want to make an informed decision on these streams of the emerging christianity... listen to them... read this book.",1,2.2445522085446093e-87,1

"Johnny Depp Starts Here' is definitely an excellent resource for the serious film scholar. Pommerance synthesizes multiple strands of theory with the multiplicity/performativity of identity and works of Johnny Depp in an engaging and accessible manner. Having done previous film projects on Depp, I tend to be skeptical about texts purporting to address the actor and his works as what I have found up to this date, for the most part, more resembles an extended issue of 'Teen Beat' than an address of film, theory, or any scholarly engagement. This book, however, does not disappoint -- easily the best book-length text on Depp theory and film I have found so far.",1,1.0917314399732096e-08,0.9999999890826856
"Zell Miller is an old school democrat. He was brewed when democrats had character and when the democrat party stood for something. Zell Miller came from the time when Ronald reagan used to be a democrat and when the democrat party had real leaders like John F. Kennedy.As a result, Zell Miller like Joe Liederman takes a lot of flack from current members of the democratic party who rely on disingenuis film producers like Mike Moore and unethical authors like AL Franken, just a more hygenic version of Michael Moore to be their PR men. The current democratic party relies on lies by liars like John Kerry, John Edwards, Howie Dean, Teddy Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, Al Gore, the Clintons, Nancy Pelosi and more.So is it any wonder that the democratic party is in disawray, is losing members and looks like a Marx brothers comedy?I am not a democrat, but I respect Zell Miller for his honesty and concern. When Zell Miller speaks, it is for for power of his dying party, but as a proud american who served and loves his country. My only complaint with Zell Miller is that he hasn't left the demcoratic party. Clearly he is in the miniority there and whatever dignity and horor that the democratic party once had, is long gone",0,0.5696241420849216,0.4303758579150784
"I found Tris to be a great hero!! He was such a complex individual - having been such a wild young man, he is beginning to fight some of his rakish ways - feeling compelled to settle down and be a ""Duke"" but in so many respects, really just wanting to be a good, carefree and decent person. Enter into his life, just when he is beginning to come into what he will be, Cressida - a young lady with so very many problems of her own. And Tris just becomes her knight in shining armor. What a knight he is too - wow he was so gallant, caring, romantic and just a delightful unassuming person. I loved some of the dialog between these two. Cressida also is the first woman that really emotionally and romantically takes ahold of Tris's heart. Because of that he seriously questions how far he is willing to allow the dictates of what is supposed to be a Duke's life and a Duke's wife and what will really compliment Tris's life. Cressida was the one thing that would make him the best that he could be - she truly brought out the best in him and it was a wonderful romantic tale.

"It took me three separate attempts, over the course of my life, to successfully read Ivanhoe. The first two times, I didn't make it past page 50. This third time, I almost stopped again... but, resolutely, I continued on, because I'd heard so many good things about the novel over the years that I knew there'd be reward waiting, just around the corner.The reason why I had stopped reading the book two-and-a-half times was because the language and syntax seem so very heavy and dense to the modern reader. And, this isn't just a ""19th Century British"" thing (though that does play a part), but, I believe, a Walter Scott thing. He has a style that seems a little impenetrable, at first. But now, having read the work to completion, I am happy to report the following: that, over time, the reader's ""ear"" becomes accustomed to Scott's storytelling; and that, the journey, for all of its initial difficulties and obstacles, is absolutely worth it. As advertised, Ivanhoe is a great novel.Set during the reign of Richard the Lion-Hearted, who is absent from an England suffering under the stewardship of the much-maligned Prince John, Ivanhoe is the tale of Saxon partisans chaffing under the yoke of their Norman masters, and of the romances and battles which result. Wilfred of Ivanhoe, son of a Saxon noble, recently returned from service in the Crusades, becomes embroiled against Norman knights during a tournament, and risks the loss of his lands and lady-love when he is gravely injured and she, kidnapped.While this happens, we also get to meet a host of widely-diverse characters, some of which are already familiar, such as Robin Hood, Friar Tuck and Allan-a-Dale, and some of whom are new, but wonderful heroes in their own rights, such as Cedric the Saxon Thane, Wamba the Jester, and Issac, the Jewish money-lender and his daughter, Rebecca. To balance such a scope of heroes, we of course need great villains, and Ivanhoe does not disappoint, rounding up (among others) the infamous Prince John and the Order of the Knights Templar.The plot is a wonderful bit of romantic action, taking us from a tournament, to an attack on a castle, to a trial-by-combat, etc. It's everything you'd expect from a story set in the Robin Hood genre.I've heard some complaint of Scott's shoddy historical details--that there are anachronisms aplenty to be found throughtout the work. As a one-time history major, I suppose that I'm the sort who ought to care about such things? And yet, I believe that the virtues of this novel, including its exciting plot, complicated characterizations (especially that of the Templar, Brian de Bois-Guilbert) and engrossing narrative voice make any substantial attention given to these temporal flaws a little off-point. We admit that Ivanhoe is not a solid history textbook; it was never meant to be one, and if you're looking to learn the history of the time, you should find something a bit further removed from the fiction aisle. What it was meant to be was an exciting, entertaining, enjoyable novel, and in that, Ivanhoe succeeds admirably.Beyond just being entertaining, Ivanhoe is also a fairly sophisticated social statement, through Scott's representation of his Jewish heroes, Issac and Rebecca. Rebecca, especially, who never acts as anything less than a saint in the work, and yet is the only hero denied a happily-ever-after ending (an interesting bit of dischord at the end), points up the hypocrisy of religious intolerance rather well. I've heard that there are lots of readers who had hoped that Ivanhoe would wind up marrying Rebecca, instead of the Christian, but rather bland, lady-fair, Rowena. I am of that number, and I suspect that Scott planned it out that way.In summary, I'm awfully glad that I managed to make myself press on, this third time around. Ivanhoe is a novel that might demand a little patience and perserverance from the modern reader, but stands ready to amply reward the efforts made. I plan on investigating Scott further in the future, and hopefully soon, before my ear once again dulls to his older, but rich and worthy voice.A true classic and a wonderful read. Five stars",1,1.4466507354266422e-50,1

"I found this book to be the most inclusive pyrography workbook in the marketplace! From the basics of equipment and safety practices, to transferring images, to techniques and troubleshooting...this book has it all. The texture chart showing how to achieve a plethora of realistic textures is absolutely incredible. Simple and easy to understand and all with just the use of three nibs! I was amazed at just how versatile this tool can be. The 3 projects included are beautifully laid out in a series of step-by-step pictures outlining the progression of each work...so you can truly watch them come to life in front of your eyes. So many manuals are vague and obscure in their direction...but not this one. Details are outlined to a ""T"". An additional section on realistic fur burning techniques is a must for all us animal lovers. What is generally deemed such a difficult subject to tackle is presented in a totally new light...not nearly as daunting as one would think. I recommend this book to both novice as well as veteran pyrographers everywhere. It is more than apparent by the picture gallery that Ms Walters is a truly gifted artist and the content of this book reveals a willingness to share her wisdom and expertise in the field of pyrography. Thank you for an outstanding book",1,6.645970473570786e-31,1

"Prof. Siegel's book is a great introductory text for business graduates with little prior exposure to statistics. The text covers many of the basic topics in statistics and ties them nicely to real world cases and problems. The book starts with a description of the basic constructs of statistics - data sets, distributions, and variability. IT follows with an introduction to probability and covers random variables. The text continues to cover statistical inference, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. Finally the book gets to regression and time series analysis and demonstrates several applications of the techniques covered.The book comes with a CD that contains lecture presentations (very useful), all the data sets in the books (saves you typing), and an excel add-on called StatPad that provides many useful statistical tools.Overall I think that this text is a good choice for MBA students and business professionals with little background in statistics.

He pokes fun at his family and describes his college years through a hauntingly funny light which at times makes the reader laugh, and yet groan audibly at his gross bordering-on-vulgar moments. Nonetheless, Sedaris finds a way to connect to his audience by highlighting the familial dysfunction that every reader can relate to. Naked is comprised of a bunch of segments of Sedaris' life and we are able to experience the love, pain, humor and anger as Sedaris recounts his life story to us. I highly recommend this book!

"Once more Christopher Tolkien has done a valuable service for literary historians and anyone interested in the craft of writing in his elegant overview of his father's struggles in creating the Lord of the Rings. His recounting of his father's writing is a fascinating saga in its own right, chronicling his father's subtle changes in the personas of characters as diverse as Boromir and Treebeard. Of special note is how significant Boromir's role might have been if he hadn't died in battle at the end of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. I was also intrigued with Tolkien making numerous changes in his depiction (and indeed, names for) of Gondor and Lothlorien, among others. There is a excellent overview on Tolkien's map of Middle-earth, noting its significant changes over the years from the 1920's until it assumed its present form for the Rings trilogy. At the end of this lengthy tome is a fine introduction to runes and how they underwent their own transformation while Tolkien was at work writing the Rings trilogy",1,2.386709684692082e-99,1

"`staffmeals' written by David Waltuck, owner and executive chef of the famous Soho restaurant, chanterelle is a very unusual restaurant cookbook in that it's recipes are made in a restaurant, but in a fashion which is more fitting to home cooking, as they are meals to be served to the staff at 4:00 PM, before the day's evening service. This means that all the meals are made for many servings at once rather than for a single serving at a time.Since all this is pretty obvious from the title and a quick read of the book's cover, let me say that I was just slightly disappointed by the fact that the book's recipes give only six to eight servings and not the 25 or more which would be needed at the restaurant. While I would (and have) criticized a home cooking book for giving recipes for twelve servings, there may be people (like me) who may really be interested in a good book of recipes for a large number of people for things like church dinners or bazaars. In all my reading and reviewing cookbooks over the last few years, I have found only a single volume which addresses cooking for a crowd. Waltuck's book doesn't even have any comments on how its recipes can be scaled up, in spite of the fact that I have seen advice that when you do scale up, it doesn't always work that you simply multiply all ingredients by two or four or eight or whatever. Spices and cooking water for rice are two things that come to mind as not easily scaleable. Waltuck's `lasagna for a crowd' recipe is one major exception to the six (6) to eight (8) serving scale. It serves twelve or more and needs a 16 x 9 inch baking pan.Now that all that grumbling is out of the way, let me say that the circumstances of this book's recipes result in lots of good meals based on easy techniques with inexpensive ingredients. The restaurant, after all, doesn't make any money on staff meals. This also means that the book is heavy on the soups, salads, roasts and stews and light on sautes. I do suspect, however, that some of the dishes that use pricy or unusual products such as crab meat or rabbit or quail may not be made very often. They are probably reserved for holidays and birthdays.While this book should not be taken as a teaching cookbook, it does contain many suggestions and much information on cooking which I have seen in few or no other books. I don't need to be convinced to use a food mill or be advised on techniques on defatting stock, but the advice on roasting beef has a lot more than I have seen elsewhere. It even gives us yet another trick for peeling lots of cloves of garlic a one time. Something you may not need for your usual Italian meal for four, but which you will need once you start in on Spanish dishes. Some of the advice may be familiar, but it is nice to have your beliefs reinforced, as when Waltuck suggests that potatoes always be boiled with their skins on, as boiling them peeled or, even worse, diced, makes them soggy and robs them of some of their flavor. The only exception is when boiling potatoes for mashed potatoes, as the point is to mash the spuds while they are still quite hot, and mere mortals without asbestos hands can't peel the hot spuds quick enough to get them mashed while still hot.One of the very best aspects of staff meals at a good restaurant, aside from the fact that the cooks are professionals, is that even the condiments such as salad dressings are `homemade', and this book is a very good source of recipes for all sorts of salad dressings, mayonnaises, remoulades, dips, and stocks.I must give credit for the book designers at publisher, Workmans, who seems to make a habit of putting a lot of careful thought into their book designs. I find myself admiring the look of their books (like this one) more than any other publisher except Alfred A. Knopf. This is a cookbook for which I suggest Bob Kinkead's advice. Kinkead has thousands of cookbooks, yet he practically never actually cooks a recipe straight from the book. So, I suggest you take this on as primarily an armchair cookbook, and expect that if you find a recipe in which you are especially interested, take it on in the knowledge that they have all been put through their paces by numerous talented professionals. And, I suspect that you will find much to improve your current favorite recipes.",1,7.554545566513667e-46,1
"When I was a child I had this book , as well as two audio tape versions of the story. ( one read by Claire Bloom, the other by Christopher Plummer, both are great!)

While the language may be more complex than some story books there is no reason why a young child can't understand it. If parents expose their children to more sophisticated language then they learn it. Toomany books, cds, tv shows etc... talk down to children! If a child is never exposed to language then they can't learn it.

"The aim of this book is to provide the reader with a comprehensive textbook that surveys the emerging body of research literature, and clearly describes procedures and methods for carrying out new research. (From the back cover) This book does that and more. While most historical overviews will cover the major personages and movements, Polkinghorn does so with easy-to-understand and adequate descriptions so you get a good idea how of the field of science, and its methods have shifted through the years. His work served me like a tour guide, and filled in the gaps in my thinking about the historical unfolding drama in science, and their seminal figures.

"In Miss T.'s book ""The Guide to Becoming the Sensuous Black Woman"" she helps black women to begin to appreciate their bodies and as a result become more sensual. Miss T. believes that being sensual means loving yourself and being in touch with your senses, your very being. She urges black women to value ourselves as the sensate creatures we are. She invites us to taste, feel, smell, and be in the moment as we explore our bodies. She declares that no man can resist a sensual black woman.Why is this book a guide for black women? Since the days of the objectification of the Hotten Tot Venus, black women's sexuality has been relegated to the physical. In other words, we have been seen as merely sexual creatures with ""abnormal"" physical dimensions such as grapefruit sized breasts, melon sized buttocks, voluptuous hips and thick lips- but that's it. Sadly most black women do not fit the mold of western standards of beauty so we internalize the distortion of our bodies and grow to hate ourselves as a result. Most black women, me included, were not taught how to be sensual, so we chase after being sexy instead of learning how to become sensual much to the detriment of ourselves and our relationships. Miss T. celebrates being a black woman who truly loves herself for all the reasons the world has tried to put her down- her hips, nose, lips, butt- her blackness!Ladies, now that the mushiness is out of the way, be sure to read her tips on swallowing, the Lifesaver trick, and anal sex (if that's your thing). Your man will definitely appreciate it, but most importantly, you will love it",1,7.41359347877085e-30,1
"This was a great book! It answered so many questions and was very thorough and easy to understand. There were sections on choosing what type of Conure--if any--is best for you, feeding, houseing, understanding, health, personality, training, behavior modification, nutrition, and even answers about all of those &quot;little things&quot; your conure does! Also, many wonderful pictures. The best book I have read on Conures yet. The information was also provided for the single companion bird environment--where most others are geared to breeding and aviary set up and care! This should be your first choice if you must only get one book",1,2.7442666116778628e-28,1
"Having never read anything by Tim Winton prior to picking up this book two weeks ago, I had no expectations whatsoever. However, from the first page I was drawn into his tale and suffered several near sleepless nights as a result of not being able to put the book down. The characters, location and plot are all highly believable AND interesting. His descriptions of the landscape just made me want to go back to Western Aus and explore more vigorously. Having lived and worked for a short time in the gold mining industry in that state, I can assure the reader that Mr. Winton captures the essence of this land and it's people. It is a truely great book and I will be reading all of his other works",1,4.612690748282132e-57,1

"As an adoptee whose circumstances are remarkably similiar to Katie's, I was blown away by this book. I am currently searching for my birth mother, so this account was fascinating.

"After writing fourteen academic books and publishing numerous articles, Eva Etzioni-Halevy has written her first splendid, lusty novel that is based on a biblical tale and her own imagination.According to Eva Etzioni-Halevy, the inspiration of The Song of Hannah emanated while she was attending services in her synagogue. As she listened intently to the biblical tale of Hannah, Pninah and Elkanah, she became greatly troubled. If you remember your Old Testament, Elkanah had two wives, Hannah and Pninah. Unfortunately, Hannah, during her early days of marriage to Elkanah, could not conceive a child, whereas Pninah had several, however, Elkanah favoured Hannah. It should be noted that eventually Hannah, after promising God that if he permits her to bear a son she will give that son back to Him as a Nazarite. Hannah is rewarded with the son she craved for, Samuel, who ultimately became a renowned prophet and leader of Israel.(The Hebrews gave the name Nazarite to a person set apart and especially consecrated to the Lord).It was difficult for Eva Etzioni-Halevy to reconcile how the Scriptures show a great deal of compassion for Hanna, the barren woman, yet no empathy for Pninah, the unloved one. In fact, the name Hannah in Hebrew means grace or favour and in the bible she is represented as saintly and aggrieved. On the other hand, the beautiful shepherdess and scribe Pninah, is depicted as being the jealous one, constantly taunting Hannah. How could this unloved one, who must have been deeply pained, not be permitted to give voice or tears to her anguish? It is this sense of unfairness and intolerance that our author identifies with, thus prompting her to take up her cause in her novel The Song of Hannah. Etzioni-Halevy poignantly reflects time and place in the eleventh century B.C when Israel was a polygamous society, as she weaves a twisting and meandering plot following the intricate inter-relations of these two women and the husband they share, as well as Hannah's son Samuel.The story also interweaves the biblical tale of Samuel, who after having lived with the high priests at the Temple, becomes one of Israel's greatest prophets. He was Israel's last judge and the first priest and prophet to serve during the time of a king. It is he who visualized the ensuing wars and endeavoured to change the lives of the Israelites who were revelling in troublesome behaviour lusting for forbidden fruit and worshipping idols.We witness Pninah's devastation when her sons are obligated to enter the war with the Philistines. Arnon, her Canaanite lover, comes to the rescue and is instrumental in saving their lives. To complicate matters, when peace is restored, Samuel cannot conceal his attraction for Pninah, his father's wife. Will he let his senses take over?No doubt, it was the author's intention to turn out an enjoyable read, however, in this case we can assert that the entertainment it affords can best be described as ""the sugar that makes the medicine go down,"" since the novel also incorporates some hidden feminist messages. By permitting two biblical women to express their own voices, the narrative movingly portrays how they were able to face life in a patriarchal society. Although weak in their position, they were strong in character, discovering ingenious ways of promoting their interests. This is a book where entertainment, religion and feminism meet.Etzioni-Halevy has seamlessly painted realistic characters living thousands of years ago with whom contemporary readers can readily identify, and portraying them as individuals with strengths, as well as with weaknesses, some of which stem from their sexuality. Surprisingly, Eva Etzioni-Halevy's mother tongue is not English. Yet, the language of The Song of Hannah is a work of art, and one of the novel's strengths is the author's uncanny ability to hone her words in sensual language devoid of vulgarism, effectively employing metaphoric expressions throughout such as, ""women who did not guard their vineyard"" (virginity).The Song of Hannah gets top marks for its sheer delight and will surely sweep you off your feet, keeping you enthralled until the last word. I cannot wait for her next novels: The Garden of Ruth, scheduled to come out in January and The Palm Tree of Deborah on which Eva Etzioni-Halevy is still working.Lily Azerad-Goldman, Artist & Book Reviewer for Bookpleasures",1,4.9302091914161545e-32,1
"This book is the best Response Surface book available today and was used in my graduate Response Surface courses.

"Giles Tremlett has written a highly readable, incisive portrait of Spain today--its problems and its pleasures. His presentation of the manner in which Spain has chosen to deal with the aftermath of Francisco Franco's death is particularly well written and revealing. He examines how the decades of dictatorship and brutal repression have been swept under the rug of collective consciousness by Spaniards choosing not to confront it or attempt to reconcile themselves with this difficult episode in their nation's history. The author's years of closely observing Spain, and reporting on its politics and culture for Britain's most respected newspaper, The Guardian, have given him a wonderful sense of both the large picture and the quotidian details, which do so much to bring this book to life.Anyone wanting a sense of what today's Spain is all about will find it in these pages.",1,3.47079032035475e-89,1
"With ""The Black Veil"", Rick Moody has written a brilliantly realized memoir which I suspect will one day be remembered as well as Frank McCourt's ""Angela's Ashes"". Indeed there are many passages throughout ""The Black Veil"" which rank alongside ""Angela's Ashes"" for their elegant literary quality. If some readers - and I might add, book reviewers such as the infamous Dale Peck - have been frustrated with ""The Black Veil"", then I suspect it may be that Rick hasn't written nearly as engrossing a tale of survival as the one depicted by Frank in ""Angela's Ashes"". It also probably has hurt Rick that he has told his tale in a nonlinear fashion, jumping to and fro between various points from his childhood to early adulthood, while trying to mingle successfully with his memoir, writing a thoughtful literary exploration of the Nathaniel Hawthorne short story ""The Minister's Black Veil"" (The entire story is reprinted in its entirety at the end of ""The Black Veil"".) and of his own biographical odyssey in search of Joseph ""Handkerchief"" Moody, the ancestor who inspired Hawthorne's short story.Among the more memorable passages are those relating to Rick's mental collapse and rehabilitation in a psychiatric clinic in Hollis, Queens (a New York City neighborhood in the borough of Queens) back in 1987. Indeed, I might add that I found most refreshing his acknowledgement of personal flaws such as drinking which led to his hospitalization (This is in stark contrast to what I read in Frank McCourt's ""Tis"", in which I perceived - whether correctly or not - that Frank was more willing to blame others for his own problems rather than acknowledging his own responsibility.). I also found rather interesting his relationships with his brother, sister, parents and grandfather, though I shall note that none of these are nearly as memorable as the anecodotes which Frank recounts of himself and his brothers in the dirty lanes of Limerick in ""Angela's Ashes"".Rick Moody has demonstrated in ""The Black Veil"", his novels and short stories that he is among the most interesting literary stylists of our time, and perhaps among the finest in our generation (Editorial Note: Rick and I were classmates in a fiction writing seminar in college taught by British feminist science fiction novelist and short story writer Angela Carter.). I suppose that's why I regard him as among my favorite authors, ranking behind the likes of William Gibson and Jonathan Lethem, in my personal list of twenty five favorite writers (And yes, of course Frank McCourt is on my list, though I will plead the fifth regarding his placement on it.)",1,2.188966932390205e-44,1
"Lucretius expounds the epicurean philosophy in this book. No one could have done it better. It is clear, logical and understandable. The book is far and away better than all atheistic and materialistic books ever written. Lucretius not only shows that reality is eternal and infinite, having no need of a creator. He argues that one does not need religion and is better off without it. He shows that life is to be enjoyed and that death is blessed nothingness,eternal freedom from suffering. The latter parts of the book deal with intriguing speculations on natural phenomena. While other books on atheism and materialism give one the impression that if god existed,the writers would be his slavish followers. Lucretius does not deny the existance of the gods ie; zeus,jesus, buddha, etc. He simply argues they are not needed. It is better not to exist than it is to exist, he argues. Although it is true he writes, that one should live out his natural life. It is a pity that this book is not mentioned in many critiques on god and the supernatural life. It belongs in the top ten of the greatest books ever written",1,1.3203878227837987e-31,1

"This is what I love about sf/fantasy: the unlimited possibilities in worldbuilding compared to stories that are more ""realistic."" And yet at the same time, stories like this book can tell us so many things about ourselves and the world around us. What would our own world be like if we weren't ""sick"" - if we didn't practice death-hastening? Could a world like Shora ever truly exist? Do we have any Spinels among us? Or are we more like Nisi?

The past few books from Suzanne have been good -- but not nearly as good as her earlier Team Sixteen books. It was almost as if Suzanne was tired and was just writing to fulfill her contract. This one, however, was Suzanne reinvigorated and at her best. High adventure, travel to foreign lands, intrigue, humor, suspence, star-crossed lovers and hot romance.

"There's no need for me to comment on Emily Dickinson, or her phenomenal poetry that is the content of this book. It will speak for itself. What I will comment on is the authenticity of this book compared to others in that this book preserves Emily's poetry the way it was, with all the ""mad"" dashes, to convey the uncontainable element within her that she was only able to release through her poetry. The author is the primary researcher of Emily's poems and has thoroughly researched the world to compile the collection pretty much as the world knows it, and he has presented it in this book in full. If you are to have a collection of Emily Dickinson's poetry, it should be this one. No questions about it",1,1.163728881411468e-32,1
"Anyone working in Interactive Marketing, whether as a Project manager or Account Manager, should keep a copy of this book on their desk for everyday reference. The authors provide a great information source for web projects, with chapters covering everything from the basic definition of the PM role within an interactive/web development project, to a detailed list of responsibilities for every team member. The chapters on team roles and Communication Cues are a must-read even for seasoned PMI certified PMs.The rest of the chapters follow the standard PM process (Project definition, planning, managing the various stages of the project, QA etc), putting everything within the web development perspective. The real life case studies are a great learning tool, and anyone who has worked as a PM on a web/interactive project will undoubtedly must have already faced similar challenges.Extensive chapters on Technical Build and QA are written without inundating the reader with tech acronyms and confusing jargon. On top of that, the book includes an appendix which addresses specific projects such as brochure ware, B2B portals, e-commerce web sites, intranets and e-marketing projects. Even better, a second appendix offers a great overview of what you really need to know regarding technology as it applies to the needs of a web development project manager. Whether you are new to Project Management or a seasoned PM, this book is a must read and great reference for the next time you will find yourself managing a web project and a number of cross functional team members who all seem to have a different vision or agenda. If nothing else, get this book for the CD.

It is packed full of important, potentially life saving information that will help you navigate safely in the desert. Everything from techniques for hiking,mountain biking, and 4x4 trips including vehicle preparation is included. There is an interesting section on troubleshooting worst-case scenarios and even a section on selecting the proper gear and equipment for desert conditions. When considering desert trips it is well to remember the admonishment of famed desert rat and author Edward Abbey:""...Enter at your own risk. Carry water. Avoid the noonday sun.

"Other reviewers have used the word ""strange"" to discribe this work. I think the words ""haunting"" and ""mysterious,"" probably hit closer to the mark. At least they do for me. This is one of those works that will certainly make you think. More importantly, it will make, or should make, the young reader think. That is the key to the fascination of the text of this work. Beyond doubt, the illustrations are quite wonderful, even beautiful. I did note that some of the youth reviews here were not overly enthusiastic. I have found that many young people do indeed ""get"" the story, while others do not. Some simply do not have the capacity to wonder, to imagine. This is sort of sad in a way, but on the other hand, it is works such as this, that if read with an adult who does have that spark of wonder in them, might allow some of that wonder to rub off. I like a good fantasy and a good mystery, ergo, I liked this book and do recommend it. The art work and stark writing alone are worth it.",1,8.703537572233465e-50,1

"If you think you know anything about Ajax, you're wrong. After you read this book you'll realize how little you knew. Michael Mahemoff has a PhD in Computer Science, but it might as well be on Ajax since I've never read a book with so much useful information about it. There are about 8 or 9 Ajax books on the market right now and none of them come close to giving the useful information this one does and that is only after reading the first 150 pages. This book really is the complete tutorial and reference to learning and using Ajax properly.The first 2 chapters go over the basic components of Ajax and some basic code examples different techniques Ajax is used to enhance functionality and usability: live search, progress indicators and the one-second spot highlight. The end of chapter 2 is a kind of teaser of what is to come in explaining some of the patterns that will be discussed with website examples to illustrate how they are done: data grids, suggestion, popup, virtual workspace, browser-side cache, fat client, drag-and-drop, image slideshow, web services, etc. Chapter 3 focuses on the basics of an ideal Ajax application and some the design principles that programmers should follow such as following web standards, accessibility, bandwidth issues, latency, and graceful degradation, among others. He sets you in the right direction in thinking how you should code your application with all these ideas in mind since proper patterns will give you smoother working applications with fewer problems when it is released into production. It is a very interesting chapter that does not go into much code but is more of a background on the issues that need to be thought about before developing your architecture. Some of these things you may have already read about in various blogs but is put together wonderfully in this early chapter.Many of the chapters to follow go through various solutions and Michael goes through various techniques ion how to solve it giving the advantages and negatives starting in chapter 4. The first solution is an Ajax App that helps user enter data quickly with instant validation, integrated searches, and dynamic form field updates. Then he asks questions in order to create this application by first giving a background on how standard web apps (flash, java, desktop, etc) have done this in the past and how Ajax can do this now. This is done throughout the book in covering different patterns with code illustrations, code snippets and web site examples. This is not a book that you can quickly breeze through mid you. It will take some time for you to read and understand everything the author is trying to get across, but you will have a greater understanding of how to use Ajax effectively and you probably will go back to this book time and time again after you finally finish it. I've never encountered a book quite so informative, but I'm so glad I did especially on such a topic such as Ajax that will be around for many years to come.The end of the book has a great appendix on the many Ajax libraries and frameworks (Backbase, Dojo, Mochikit, OpenRico, Script.aculo.us, Moo.fx, JSON, SAJAX, Atlas.NET,, etc) that are out now.Very well done",1,9.918280585058012e-69,1

"This is a concise, readable, and logically coherent book that balances the fundamentally biological perspective of the material with a genuine introspection regarding the inconsistencies in the literature. Pulling from some of the most recent literature on the topic, it delineates the major uses, actions, and effects (both positive and negative) of each major psychopharmacological agent. The two most appealing additions to this book, setting it apart from its competition, are some rather compelling side bars focussed on critically thinking about the use and misuses of psychopharmacological agents, and the wonderful appendix that lists the major psychopharcalogical agents, with generic name, trade name, and manufacturers. I would highly recommend this book to any undergraduate or graduate student/professor with interest in/instructing a course in psychopharmacology. Furthermore, I would recommend it to anyone, both layperson and expert, who might have an interest in learning more about this complex area of study",1,9.484638184949342e-29,1

First off , the author does change some of her code in the source files, which I myself found to be annoying. but she does a great job covering directx, and if you wade it out, you will find a great instructional manual.The material is solid, and it successfully covers a lot of ground.

"This book is far and away the best reading possible. I am an avid reader of the classic, country house murder mystery from Britain's golden age of mystery writing, and James Anderson just nails it here. Masterfully. He somehow combines complex plotting, excellent writing, and humor so that the story is both a suspenceful whodonit as well as an entertainment tour de force. You simply must buy this book.To be more specific:1) The setting: Alderly, the ancestral pile of the Earl of Burford. And an alarm system that makes entry or exit from Adderly impossible at night.2) The time: 1930s.3) The cast of characters: an eccentric peer, his stately wife, their spirited daughter, an ""Honourable"" on hard times, a beautiful but mysterious woman who fascinates, obscure dimplomats and foreign office men, a secretary of questionable skill, rich Americans carrying diamonds, an author of dubious intent, and Merryweather - the omniscent, ever-present, yet dignified butler.4) The clue: a blood-stained egg cosy.5) The plot: epsionage, jewel theft, murder, impersonation, a secret passageway, in fact everything but the kitchen sink. It's right on par with Agatha Chirstie's ""The Secret of Chimney's.""How could this go wrong? It doesn't. It goes very right. And you will NOT figure out who the murderer is. Save some shipping and order this book with Anderson's other masterpiece ""The Affair of the Mutilated Mink.",1,5.877897458089586e-28,1
"I'm a Republican and I voted for Bush twice. Like the author, I did not want to believe that our president acted in bad faith or that he has made deliberate assaults upon basic Consitutional rights. But unfortunately the facts and the record seem to bear that thesis out. True conservatives are supposed to believe in limited, smaller government. Bush does not. True conservatives are supposed to support the Constitution. Bush does not. True conservatives are supposed to be, at a minimum, skeptical of government authority. Bush is not.One of the biggest problems with too many critics of Bush is they will argue and say just about anything. Eg. Bush is a ""Nazi""; Bush only wants to help out his friends in the oil industry, and so forth. Most of it is angry and irrational. This sort of hysteria hurts their credibility. Indeed, it actually helps Bush and his people because it tends to cloud the real issues. Greenwald cannot be lumped in with this crowd. His writings are well reasoned and his facts are sound. Instead of just clamoring for power, instead of patting themselves on the back for having the ""moral courage"" to watch the latest Michael Moore adolescent film, instead of shouting nonsense, good Democrats (and Republicans) need to be asking the President the following questions: (1) Are you or have you been authorizing or encouraging abuse and/or torture of prisoners? How do you define torture? (2) If there is indeed a ""war"" on terror, is it your goal to increase the authority of the executive branch during such a ""war"" such that it cannot be checked by either the Congress or the Judiciary? (3) Can you explain why you would give less due process rights than those recommended by your own military lawyers? (4) Do you intend to abide by the Supreme Court's ruling in Hamden v. Rumsfeld?As a conservative Republican, I cannot avoid the conclusion that these policies have damaged our nation and its battle against those who would enjoy seeing it destroyed. As evidence accumulates that tends to show that the abuses of Abu Ghraib were not merely an aberration, but part of Administration policy, it becomes increasingly difficult to argue to others that we are indeed a beacon of hope and freedom to the world without incurring a scoff. Here's hoping that Greenwald sells a lot more books and helps start a national dialogue that we need to have.

"After 20 years of reading about Last and First Men I have found it at last. If your idea of a novel is a book about people's relationships, it may not be for you. That particular element of novels bores me to death and this is more my idea of a compelling read. The history of mankind from 1930 to a few billion years hence is pre-written by a philosopher and fantasist possessed of a great and unquiet mind, inhuman but not inhumane as someone has well put it. On no account skip the opening chapters, whatever anyone tells you. The fact that S got the world's history 1930-2003 completely wrong is not the point -- the rest of it will almost certainly prove to be all wrong too, if we think like that. What these first chapters do is to get us into the author's weird exalted and passionless mindset. He is not so much on another planet as in an alternative universe. It is entirely to the book's advantage that he has no grasp of Realpolitik and even that he has no detectable sense of humour -- when I was beginning to feel the latter as a lack I came to the only bit where he ascribes humour to any of his characters, a race of monkeys depicted in general unsympathetically and not least for their possession of this deplorable characteristic. That put me in my place I can tell you. From start to finish I got no sense of either pity or cruelty as he chronicles the the periodic near-annihilations that overtake the various successive human races, and while his account of the systematic extermination of the intelligent life on Venus filled me with a wrenching sense of tragedy that I did not feel for any of the mankinds the author himself seemed as unmoved as ever. If Wuthering Heights was written by an eagle, who or what wrote Last and First Men? Of other human proclivities I can report that sex is methodically accorded its place in a thorough and businesslike manner reminiscent of Peter Simple's great sexologist Professor Heinz Kiosk (assisted by Dr Melisande Fischbein). Of anything I would recognise as love or affection or friendship I can find not a trace.

"Ray Kurzweil brings us a fun and fascinating diet with aspect of this book is that it provides a look into the progression of medical research and technology and the amazing possibilities that await us in the not-so-distant future.

"Islam and terrorism provides a basic (very basic) introduction to Islam and Islamic history focusing specifically on people, events and ideology leading up to modern terrorist movements. The author claims that he is a former Muslim, Ph.D. professor of Islamic history at Al-Azhar University in Cairo. This is confirmed by one of the reviewers listed in the book who says he personally met with and checked out the author's references. The author writes under a pseudonym for reasons that will be quite obvious after reading the harrowing story his background. After reading the Amazon reviews by critics of this book I had to wonder if some of them had ever actually read the book. For example, one says that there is no record of the author at Al-Azhar University, although the book makes clear that the author is writing under a pseudonym. Others write as if the Author is simply spewing hatred against Muslims when it is very clear from the book that the author has a deep personal love for the Muslims. His intention was to explain the rise of Islamic terrorism, not to cast aspersions on the Muslim people. It is hard to understand how anyone who actually read the book could miss that.The book is outstanding and should be considered essential reading for every adult in America.",1,3.9538360422565706e-49,1

The information contained within it kept me fascinated for hours and still does. I refer to it anytime I wish to know anything about the planets, eclipses, statistics concerning the planets etc. Each planet is addressed separately giving a history of the founder, how it was located. The beginning of each section pertaining to a planet includes items such as:Physical Data: Size, Mass, Escape Velocity, Temperature Range, Oblateness, Surface Gravity, Volume, Magnetic Field Strength and orientation, Albedo, Density, Solar Irradiance, Atmosphere Pressure, Composition of Atmosphere, Maximum Wind Speeds, Cloud Features, Surface Features, Orbital Data, Observational Data, Early Ideas (a good history of how people interpreted information in earlier periods of time when technology was not as advanced as now), Important Concepts, Transits, Interesting Facts, Observing Data which includes Conjunction dates, elongation dates, Close conjunctions, Eclipses if applicable, Historical timelines. The above information is provided for each planet, which makes this invaluable source book. In the beginning of the book there are comparison charts showing how each planet compares in Albedo, Angular Size, Atmospheric Composition, Atmospheric Pressure, Brightness & size of the Sun from each planet, Brillancy at Opposition, Cloud Features, Constellations Visited by the Moon and Planets, Density, Distances from Earth, Distances from Sun, Eccentricity, Escape Velocity, Future Dates of Conjunction (up to 2010), Future dates of Opposition (up to 2010), Future Significant Alignments, Future Transits (up to 2255), Inclination of Orbit, Magnetic Field strength and orientation, Mass, Named features on the planets and the Moon, Names of the planets, Sun and Moon around the world (includes: Arabic, Danish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Russian, Spanish, Swedish), Oblateness, Orbital period, Orbital Velocity, Rotational Period, Rotational Velocity (equatorial), Size, Solar Irradiance, Speed of Light Travel Times, Surface Gravity, Synodic Period, Temperature Range, Tilt of Axis, Volume, Winds Speeds, Satellites (which includes all the subject headings here for each satellite)This is a wonderful book, packed with information that will fascinate and amaze at the same time teaching you about the universe.

"Travel on a gastronomic journey through the Middle East and learn about the wonders of Arabian cuisine in this great little cookbook by Mike Harrison.Mike Harrison is an English Language teacher who has been living in the Middle East for years. He has traveled all over sampling the cuisines, and even consulting local chefs and restaurants for tips on how to recreate the delicious meals he had sampled on his adventures. This is his first book.There are wonderful color photos showing the delicious recipes, and the scenic views of the Middle East. Both were wonderfully photographed, especially at a time when some citizens are intimidated by this area with the current political situation. The recipes are easy-to-read and easy-to-prepare. I would say that a novice cook is capable of preparing these meals. Mike Harrison even helps explain certain spices and techniques utilized with the cuisines of this area.There are over 50 recipes in this book. The chapters in this cookbook are: soups, salads, appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Some of the delicious recipes you can find in this book are: Arabian Lentil Soup; Moroccan Carrot, Date and Orange Salad; Iranian Eggplant Puree; Beef Tenderloin with Tamarind Sauce and Spice Island Spice Cake.Whether you are into Arabian food or are an armchair traveller, check out this book.",1,1.644300373233037e-106,1

"This brilliant book is the best one-volume account of New World slavery I have seen, or could imagine. Davis has done something rare here. Having mastered this history over a lifetime of distinguished scholarship, he has now distilled his knowledge for a general audience. Too often, the experts won't, or can't, ""popularize,"" and the popularizers are not expert. Davis is a gifted writer--some of the prose in this book is breathtaking--and an unusually lucid thinker. And so he was able to get his vast knowledge into a tight frame.An earlier reviewer, while acknowledging how ""glorious"" this book is, complained of digressions. But where that reader saw detours, I found electrifying connections and illuminating comparisons. To survey history is to digress, because there is always more than one thing going on at a time, always more than one current steering events.Slavery is not a pleasant subject, but it is as important to American history as any subject could be. Here we have the book that allows every sincere reader to acquire a broad understanding of this sordid, crucial story.I rarely pay much attention to blurbs on the back of a book. But the testimonial to this book by Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson bears repeating, because it is exactly right. This is a ""gracefully fashioned masterpiece ... simply indispensable ... the glorious culmination of the definitive series of studies on slavery by one of America's greatest living historians.""",1,1.0471858792949538e-92,1

"Oh, please, this book is just ridiculous and trite.Here we have Olympia, the ""perfect"" modern woman, beautiful, a successful, high powered lawyer, who has the perfect job, gets to take every Friday off even (don't we all?), a perfect and wealthy husband who loves her dearly (but of course), two gorgeous twin teen-age daughters, one a ""rebel"" interested in protesting everything, the other a social butterfly (would you expect anything else?), a mother in law from heaven (An Auschwitz survivor - to bring a little pathos into the story) who she loves better than her own (dead) mother, (what other kind of mother in law could she be?) and a young, perfect son (naturally). Oh, did I leave anyone out? Let's see - she has her requisite ex-husband who naturally is an alcoholic and a complete jerk (hmm, nothing new there), with his silly new wife (well, did you expect her to be anything else?) , her one black friend (yes, keeping the story ""real""), and oh yes, the real point of the ""coming out"" - not her beautiful twin daughter's coming out ball, but her eldest son admitting to her that he is gay, at the ball, of course, while she gazes up at him proudly with tears in her eyes. (let's bring the storyline right into today's headlines).The book was so filled with cliches it was pathetic. From the husband taking a stand against going to the ball because it was against everything he believes in (while he is, naturally, fighting for the poor and downtrodden in his high powered legal job), to the ex-alcholic husband ""playing the ponies"" and living on his trust fund (has not worked in 15 years), to one of the twins getting a tattoo, which just almost destroys Olympia because the tattoo will show when the twin wears her dress to the ball, oh, but, handy survivor grandma to the rescue, who manages to sew a perfect stole by hand in one afternoon, after Olympia dashes around and naturally is able to find the material in the exact shade, weight and hue as the dress. Of course this coming out ball is supposed to be for ""WASP"" society only, so the husband makes a stand by refusing to come to the ball. Olympia decides to make her own stand, by inviting her black friend and her husband, as well as her Auschwitz survivor mother in law, to the ball. In the days before the ball, the youngest son gets chicken pox, the mother in law falls down and breaks her ankle, one of the twins boyfriends breaks up with her, one of the twins loses a glove (chewed up by a friend's dog) and Olivia has to run out to buy a pair of manolo blahnik heels for her daughter. Oh, yes, and the twin's escort shows up to the ball with electric blue hair.But, because Olympia is perfect, she manages to ""fix"" everything at the last minute . . did you expect anything less?This book was just awful, and did not ring true at all. Each character was a cliche in themselves, way over the top. The premise of the story was ridiculous. . . I have read most of Danielle Steele's work, ok, so she is not Dostoyevsky, but her books were good for sitting down on a long afternoon with a nice cup of tea and reading a juicy and interesting story. This short book seemed like it was almost written because she had contractual obligations to fulfill. There was no passion, the sentences were short and stilted, and she seemed totally disinterested in her characters.

"In early adolescence I fell in love with a young girl who inhabited a picture frame in the corridors of our high school.Our gazes were mutually netted. In 1982, whilst touring Holland, I detoured to den Hague to renew that engagement, only to see in her stead a plaque indicating she was on loan to a Texan museum for 12 months.But it's some consolation to encounter Edward Snow's study of Vermeer, whose cover is adorned by that image of my adoration. Even better, Snow is an adept reader of Vermeer's vision of inner equalibrium and imperturbable calm. Lawrence Gowing provided my 1960's art college template, but I think no serious admirer now should overlook this book. The subtlety of thought and feeling in Vermeer has found appropriate eloquence. Vermeer's 'hermetic inwardness','magical silence', his'unity of being as structured by perception', his contemplation of women caught in precious domestic moments of equanimity & pleasure in the happiness of their mere visibility, are given appropriately intimate treatment. There are telling parallels made with Degas's pursuit of feminine imagery. And Snow isn't averse to pointing out Vermeer's 'failures', which, he argues, reflects the artist's proclivity for negative reflection.' I'm sorry I can't enthuse over the recent film,'Girl With A Glass Earring'. In spite of the set pieces, and the attractiveness of the actors; the enigmas of Vermeer remain opaque.The book, however, is an absolute master stroke",1,3.4308325357382234e-33,1
"This is neither a sugarcoat bio or a hatchet job. The author gives the reader a thourough look at Joe Namath both as a man and an athelete.For those of us who remember him as a gimpy kneed quarterback it came as quite the revelation to find out he was a slam dunking guard in basketball and a baseball prospect. Namath was a natural but he wasn't afraid of work either. In spite of his playboy image he spent a lot of nights at home studying game film. Not only of himself but of the next weeks opponent. Apart from the usual money motivation he also pursued endorsments because he thought he would have a short career due to his knees.His life most recently has not been the happiest, his wife left him for a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon. Plus there was his humiliation on national TV when he offered to kiss a female reporter during a live interview.

"I'm old enough to have been baking for quite a few years, and young enough to be surrounded by people who generally don't worry about their weight--people who have never made a cookie in their lives, but are wonderful for testing out large batches of baked goods. While I would not recommend this book to one of them (when I told one of them that my brownie recipe was ""easy,"" she happily exclaimed, ""Oh, good, which mix is it?"") I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a fantastic cookie and is willing to take the necessary time and effort to make it. Some of the initial recipes are a bit repetitive--I don't necessarily believe that one needs a whole new recipe just to make white-chocolate macadamia cookies when a substitution instruction from the choco chip-walnut cookies will do--but every one that I've tried has been mind-meltingly delicious. The quotes are nice, and the varieties of tips for cookie making are concise and, as far as I can tell, spot on the mark. My favourite recipe thus far has been the chocolate sugarsnaps, but then, I'm only halfway through the book..",1,2.5710527699476557e-07,0.999999742894723
"Steve Taylor manages to come up with a seemingly obvious but until now neglected theory about human nature and the development of civilisation. He analyses not only where we went wrong historically but also where we are still going wrong today. Our intensified sense of ego distorts the way we behave, as does the establishment of a culture that rewards selfishness, aggressiveness and the whole me-me-me I-want-it-now childishness that embodies the modern world. He says what a lot of people (including me) have been thinking for a while. If there is war, oppression and hunger in the world - how did it get here? And can we ever change? Steve Taylor suggests some fascinating answers to these questions. I was impressed enough to give up my job and house and go and live in a field growing my own vegetables... well, maybe not yet.",1,0.4709589640355548,0.5290410359644452

Most of the others are comforting but lack detail. In contrast, this book is very thoughtful - it offers multiple alternatives for specific situations and it tells you WHY you would decide one way or the other. Sometimes it recommends a course of action and other times it lays out the alternatives and their pros and cons. But it always treats the reader as an intelligent and thoughtful person. I expected most pregnancy books to be written that way, but unfortunately, this is the only one I have found that arms the reader with the &quot;why&quot; behind each option",1,5.00006802352587e-100,1

"For the past two years Dr. Goldratt (Founder of Theory of Constraints) has been going around the country providing Viable Vision Seminars to explain the concept and what is required to develop a Viable Vision. What is a Viable Vision? It is basically a comprehensive strategy that leverages all of the disciplines of TOC.Gerry's book is the perfect compliment, guide if you will, to the Viable Vision seminar. The book starts by describing the premise behind a Viable Vision. It then goes on to detail each of the disciplines that will need to be considered when developing a Viable Vision and the TOC approach to each of them. The disciplines are Marketing, Operations, Project Management, Supply Chain, and IT. The book then talks about how to gain buy-in, as well as strategy, and executing the paradigm shift required in order to implement a successful Viable Vision.The book concludes with actual examples of some Viable Vision's created for a Distribution and Irrigation company.Viable Vision is an excellent overview of Theory of Constraints and its application to each function within an organization.

"Garage Band may be the coolest and most powerful of the Apple iLife applications. It allows virtually anyone to create an at least decent-sounding musical composition. However, it is not simple and its many features allow for quite sophisticated and complex compositions suitable for professional level use. Yet, Apple provides only minimal on-screen help material. Hence, the need for a book like Garage Band: The Missing Manual. This is another of the O'Reilly Media Inc. Missing Manual series, and like all the many others I've read, this is a well-written, content-filled volume. O'Reilly should write manuals for creators of all full-featured applications as they have the formula down for doing it right. This volume is written by David Pogue with his usual combination of substance and style. The presentation is systematic, yet friendly, and with handfuls of wit. The book has two main parts and an appendix containing a mini-music crash course, a menu-by-menu description of Garage Band, and a list of keyboard shortcuts. Part 1 covers the basics of using and understanding Garage Band - how to install and set up, and how to understand the concepts of tracks, loops, editing, and recording. Emphasis is made of the two types of data input used by the program, so-called digital recordings and MIDI. Each is handled differently by the program and care is made throughout the book to explain how to deal with each. Like the rest of the Missing Manuals he's authored, Pogue uses a hands-on approach to describe and explain how to produce quality output from the program, He weaves music theory concepts with program feature descriptions and gives helpful suggestions to the typical user how best to use the program's features to make music your family will be proud hearing. In Part 2, Pogue explains how to publish your output and use the results with iMovie, iPhoto, and iDVD, He covers more advanced topics as well, like troubleshooting and extending the program with available plugins and compatible software. References to the more professional level features of Garage Band are noted but not covered in any detail, as most users will never touch these features. O'Reilly's website (www.missingmanuals.com) has tutorial samples and shareware programs to download and use while going through the chapters.

"This audio book really got to me. It started out slow, with Nick, the main character trying to sort out how to deal with the death of his father in a car crash, and hearing a variety of &quot;voices,&quot;as he seems to wander in and out of reality. I found myself wondering where this strange beginning was going, but very quickly I was caught up in Nick's predicament. Several things take place later in the story that will break your heart. It is masterfully told by an outstanding narrator and I found myself wiping tears from my eyes on several occassions, as the story came to a close. Although the two-tape audio book is an abridgement, it is very powerful. I also like the way animals are strangely &quot;drawn&quot; to Nick. A real keeper...don't miss it",1,2.0469127689093477e-86,1

"As a graduate student who studies human memory (and its errors), I picked up this book as a &quot;fun read&quot; to suppliment my academic curiosity. While I am familar with much of the research Dr. Schacter summerizes in this book, I never found the text &quot;too dumbed down&quot; for my taste. In fact, I found it to be a very enjoyable read and discovered many new studies I was previously not familar with. At the same time, I do not think this book is too technical for the average educated reader that may not be familar with memory or even psychological research. Dr. Schacter's book provides an interesting framework for considering many of the everyday (and not so everyday) problems with memory. By combining research from psychology and neuroscience, with anecdotes from popular culture and history &quot;The Seven Sins of Memory: How the Mind Forgets and Remembers&quot; gives a complete overview that is both stimulating and entertaining",1,2.064475334379819e-35,1

"Allright, listen: I will break it down for you country simple. There is very little actual literature in the world and most of that is not recognized as such. Why? Because most of the people who set themselves up as arbiters of literary art have no discernment and bad intellectual character and so are easily bamboozled by writing that reflects to them their own dishonesty and narcissism. Cobroc McGonigle, or whatever his name is, is one of the writers who will be ballyhooed to the skies by the taste frauds who cannot tell what makes good writing and what makes bad writing. They just can't tell the difference. And so they are suckered by pretentious, narcissistic phrase-making and word molesting. Like for example inventing new words like ""candleflame"" And churning out lots of copy. With pretentious and asinine titles like ""All the Pretty Horses."" This is the kind of title a teenager with no talent for writing should have come up with in the process of getting an F in high school creative writing. Basically, the same people who cannot see through William Fakener will be unable to see through Comrod McDougal, only more so. William Fakener may as well have been reincarnated as Copran McViegle. He wrote the exact same type of tripe, complete with pretentious, meaningless titles like ""Intruder in the Dust."" You intrude in any dust lately? Oh, I forgot, I'm just not with it enough to swing with the hip literary fast set. You know, the fast set that is composed of (not ""comprised"" of , that is a pretentious mis-usage) middle-aged women with vague but rather humble pretentions to art appreciation who join and promulgate book clubs. They know they're too dumb to ""get"" why this stuff is so great.

"This book is very well researched, but is EXTREMELY poorly written. It is the driest and most boring history book that I have ever read in my life. The entire thing is presented as a simple collection of facts and the author hardly gives you any insight into what the major characters were really like (sometimes you get a little glimpse in the footnotes).

"In my consulting career, I have worked on lots of models to value M& A candidates, to restructure debt, to perform due diligence etc. My main problem was that I always found it difficult to get a good reference book on valuation. Most books just give the basics of DCF and treat valuation in a straightforward manner. Arzac's book on the other hand treats valuation from a practical and theoretical perspective and is supported by research evidence. I found his book to be very helpful as it contained the different types of valuation tools and arrangements commonly found in practice i.e. adjusted present value, earnouts, original issue discount, synergies and scenario analysis, contingent clauses, entry, foothold and exit options etc. I am an engineer by training so I found the technical notes at the end of the book to be very handy. In addition, the CD accompanying Arzac's textbook is very useful as it provided many essential valuation tools such as option pricing, debt capacity calculator etc. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a serious interest in corporate finance, consulting and investment bankin",1,1.1896326255098142e-74,1
"Since I am currently participating in the Neophyte grade of the Golden Dawn, I purchased this text as a supplement to my study regimen. While there is some disagreement among my proctors as regards the propriety on the Cicero's part in making this information for the outer grades available, it has been immensely valuable to me as a secondary resource, the the Ciceros have basically done nothing any more inflammatory than Regardie himself in the Publication of the Golden Dawn so many years ago. While the basic information in the various grade lectures is intact, there are also some differences in the perspectives and points of view, as well as some in the timing of information presented (an example of the latter is that the meanings associated with the Tarot cards is presented as if it were part of the Philosophus grade, whereas one is actually exposed to this material during the Neophyte and Zelator grades in the actual Golden Dawn). However, I must concur that &quot;self-initiation&quot; into the Golden Dawn is an onerous, if not impossible, task. It's like writing a text on &quot;Self Admission to and Study of a Harvard MBA&quot;, or such-like. You cannot be part of the Golden Dawn without being intiated into it. The Golden Dawn is not a way of thinking, or a religious belief that one can associate with simply by having a like mind. It's an established magickal order, and to be appreciated by its membership, one must join it. This is much simpler than following the book. First, the Order is actually quite easy to contact, and generally welcomes everyone, at least in the early grades. Second, the course of study is difficult enough, but the initiatory experiences proscribed in the book, while very much the same as in the Temple, are FAR too complicated for a beginner to successfully perform, and completely omit the astral and essential benefit of the performance by ordained initiates of the Golden Dawn. Believe me, it's much simpler to pay your ?120 per year and go through the initiatory experience within the temple, as well as have a dedicated instructor/proctor to quiz you on the material. You would spend AT LEAST that amount of money on just the implements required for just one of the initiatory rituals included within this text. Finally, any organized Golden Dawn temple would likely refuse to admit or recognize the work you have done until you actually do take the plunge and JOIN, and even then you would be required to pass through the various grades (no Advanced Placement credit allowed, I'm afraid). If one is looking for a course in magick based on the Golden Dawn system of magick, Modern Magick, by DM Kraig, still stands as one of the best. If one wants to be part of the Golden Dawn, join it! It's easy to do! Then buy this book to supplement the order's already phenomenal course materials",1,2.8394770885079444e-134,1

I can understand how it might be a neat story that she went there not knowing spanish but that she still learned how to cook some things... however, her ""outsiders perspective"" comes across as irritating ignorance. her methods are anecdotal (as oppossed to researched) and in her recipes and stories she manages to miss both the grace of high class mexican cuisine and the flair of mexicos bountiful street food culture. diana kennedy and rick bayless (to name the two most famous) both have books in english that are more thoughtful and authoritative. even a quick glance at one of these far superior books will expose ortiz's attempt as the exercise in vain superfulousness that it is",1,2.54457301747753e-36,1
"This is a powerful little book that will be of interest to teachers, college guidance counselors and curriculum directors. As luck would have it, I am a teacher and the curriculum coordinator for the humanities departments at my school, and I am teaching senior English for the first time this year. I had just initiated conversations across the grade levels (7-12) regarding the dearth of assignments that include narrative writing and the importance of that in terms of developing a critical set of writerly skills, in particular because of the college essay, when Mary Jane Reed's book became available. In it, Reed addresses all of the concerns we were raising, sees the connections we were seeing, and extends both of them. She provides powerful tools for teachers and for students in this very essential arena. Reed's goal is to help teachers and guidance officers to help students write powerful college essays, and she points out that this an important way of writing and thinking that is often overlooked across the curriculum. I know that it is true at my school, and when I worked with my senior students this year to create a portfolio of college essays, this authentic and meaningful (few, if any, scholarly activities have meant more to students by this point in their academic careers) exercise opened the door to discussions about writing and about their writing in particular, that I had never experienced in my years of teaching grades 9 through 11 and college composition. What a delight to find my growing awareness and concern mirrored in this meticulously crafted little book. High school teachers who crave practical advice and applicability will find that here, along with a compact disc filled with material that can be used as handouts and transparencies.

"As hopeless as a town that will always burn. Doctrow's novel is sleek and powerful, not just an American story, but the story of all society, building up and breaking down, of the dirty nature of the human soul, and the little spots of light that try to burn bright; a story in which the democratic mass is dangerous and the philosopher king is not as powerful as he aught to be, and the Bad Man from Bodie, like the Lord of the Flies, is not only always waiting to ride down from the mountain, but resides in most every human heart. Still, it is an essentially American novel and pays particular interest to deconstructing the Myth of the American West, a kind of anit-Shane.",1,6.902655974482426e-35,1
"Louis Armstrong is one of the central figures along with Duke Ellington of Giddins's incredible Visions of Jazz, and that sent me to Satchmo, a mindblowing collection of photographs and a biographical and musical discussion that brings the man and his work to life. Although Giddins covers some of the same ground here as in Visions, it is a far more expansive study built on the idea that Armstrong was at once a great artist and a great entertainer and that his role in one area did not diminish his role in the other. The pictures are remarkable, and numerous excerps from Armstrong's own writing show what a decent and joyful man he was. Highly recommended",1,2.872927653956188e-35,1

"This is a book I wish I had when I was a child. The mother and child featured in this story are beautifully illustrated and I like the intelligent conversations they have about improper touching, whether or not it is sexual.The book respects readers' intelligence by using the proper terminology for genitalia and the generic term ""bottom"" to mean the buttocks. I like that. Too many works are weakened by silly euphemistic or babyish names for the anatomy that do nobody any real service. This book is a good teaching tool and an excellent forum for discussion of a serious topic. It is one that all ages would find beneficial. Another reviewer made the good point that boys also can be sexually abused and this is never addressed in this book. I agree that this already excellent work would have been even more effective had the discussion included a brother as part of the discussion. While it is only natural to want to preserve a child's innocence, it is still very vital to empower children with information about what constitutes desired (non-sexual) and ""good"" touches and what doesn't. This in turn will help families build a more safety-savvy world.This book does an excellent job of defining ""privacy"" replete with examples, e.g. ""private parts"" are the parts of one's body that is generally covered by their underwear or a bathing suit. The girl featured in the story declares that nobody can touch her private parts in ways she does not want and then goes on to describe other kinds of touching she doesn't like, such as sitting on her uncle's lap. On the flip side, ""good touches"" are highlighted, such as loving cuddles and dancing and an arm around the shoulder. The distinction could not be more clear and for that I salute this book!Gray areas such as tickling are explored. Tickling can be fun, but it can also go too far where the one being tickled is not enjoying it. That is another example of when to demand that a certain ""touch"" or tactile activity be stopped. The children are well within their rights to do so at any time. Hugs and kisses are described as generally being welcome and acceptable, but children should not be forced to kiss or endure being kissed by someone who makes them feel uncomfortable. The literary mother is very wise; she makes it plain to her daughter that it is the child's feelings that are paramount and not to worry about hurting somebody's feelings if she tells them not to touch her in ways she does not like. Genital touching including being forced to touch someone else's private parts is discussed; the girl is also told not to take photographs of somebody's private parts or willingly allow anyone to photograph hers. My favorite part was when the mother tells her daughter that the predator is NOT always a stranger and can be someone the child knows very well, including a relative. That point CANNOT be stressed enough. The child is told to try to escape as soon as possible and tell an adult she trusts what happened. I agree with another reviewer that there is a dearth of stories like this for boys as boys also can be the recipients of sexual abuse. Since the girl has a brother, one wonders why he was not included in this safety talk since part of the discussion involved him. His safety has to be considered as well. Another good point is made by having the mother tell her daughter that it is never acceptable for ""other children"" as opposed to ""older children"" because that could be misleading. Those few things notwithstanding, I feel this is one of the best books I've encountered on this very serious subject.I also recommend Sandy Kleven's ""The Right Touch: A Read Aloud to Help Prevent Child Sexual Abuse,"" Cornelia Spelman's ""Your Body Belongs to You"" which is ideal for the preschool set on up and Peter Alsop's collection ""Songs on Sex & Sexuality,"" most particularly the song, ""My Body.""

"I received this book as a gift when it first came out. I had always admired this great president, but hadn't read anything else on Lincoln prior to this book. I found that I couldn't put it done and read it in like 3 days. I almost would describe the book as a picture album full of snapsnots taken by Lincoln's friends, family, and acquaintances. I write this review nearly 4 years later because I picked it up again to read after a recent Lincoln program on PBS aired on television. I fell in love with the book and the man once again.

"At first the different labels can get confusing for the lay-person but I found Dr Simon's analysis of the manipulative character and personality so illuminating. I have had relationships with manipulative partners and made that mistake of coming from the classical model of defence systems - developed sense of conscience etc. I was stymied! I could not understand their actions in relation to what they professed to believe etc. Now I do! Thank you Dr Simon for sharing your work with us. I also believe it is extremely dangerous to approach these disturbed characters from the classical psychological models as it really enables them to ""hijack"" the services and keep on manipulating. That doesn't help society nor the manipulator one bit. I hope that you can convince contemporary psychological field to take on board your findings.

"I have enjoyed many books by Mr. Beevor, and this one is as well-written and infornative as his others. Everyone knows, at least in some way, the story of WWII and the Occupation of Paris, but most of us do not know what happened in that city, and in France, after it was liberated. This book fills in our gap in that knowledge quite well, and it shows that France was really on the front lines of the Cold War during the latter part of the 1940's. We read of the humanitarian and generous contributions of the US to the initial recovery of France, and how its leadership strove mightly to regain a stable government while. at the same time, trying their best of overcome the stigma of Vichy. What amazes me is that there is such a lack of gratitude among the French to the US for all that we have done for them in the 20th century. This book shows that, once again, ""No good deed goes unpunished"".",1,2.5536886692521554e-54,1
"If I didn't know any better, I'd swear this was a book written by a Satanist. The author seems to be rejoicing in the prospect of armageddon, including mountains being blown up and the destruction of all the world's cities. I bought a tatty copy for one penny and I was somewhat surprised to see that by 1973 it was on its 27th printing. It seems reasonable then to assume that Mr Lindsey's views are fairly representative of mainstream America. If that's the case then that suggests that plenty of Americans are keen for armageddon to erupt in the Middle East so that the ""good Christians"" may be whisked off for a private audience with J. Christ while the rest of the population burns. I would recommend this book to all Israelis. In his book The Last Days of Israel, Zionist author Barry Chamish declared that Israel's main enemies were European Socialists. Well, I reckon that Hal Lindsey and his fans present a greater threat. It seems likely that if the supposed Temple of Solomon is not rebuilt and Israel isn't annihilated then a lot of committed Christians are going to be most upset. The bit of ""good news"" in Lindsey's book is that the surviving Israelis will convert to Christianity with such passion that they will be like ""144,000 Billy Grahames"". It seems that committed Christians are in charge of both the UK and US governments and that the US government could be described as a theocracy. I wonder if the theocrats share the views of Mr Lindsey, who states in this book that each Arab generation hates Israel more than the one before, which would be good news as it would mean that they would be more likely to attack and initiate armageddon and cause the return of Jesus Christ.Russia is portrayed as the villain of the book, but ""Red China"" and the ""Red Chinese"" get a look-in in a chapter entitled ""The Yellow Peril"". The book however does contain one true statement, on page 120: ""Religion is a great blinder of the minds of men."" and frankly, I hope ""the rapture"" does happen soon. The sooner that people like Hal Lindsey are whisked off the face of the Earth, the greater the likelihood for peace in the world",1,3.151387367874355e-104,1

"In the review: ""Buyer Beware! Raw meat kills...""Reviewer Shani most likely has not read this book, as what Kliment says is not to drink raw milk, rather to look for organic milk that has been safely pasteurized with different techniques to retain important enzymes. She writes:Milk Raw,p. 24-24: ""It was common for physicians in the early part of the twentieth century to use raw milk and butter made from raw milk for therapeutic purposes... Federal and state laws requiring pasteurization of dairy products, however, make raw milk almost impossible to come by. Most agribusiness dairies heat their milk to 212 degrees. Louis Pasteur discovered that milk heated to 140 degrees for one-half hour was enough to kill bacteria. The purpose of boiling the milk at 212 degrees is not to keep the public safe from bacteria that causes disease but to extend the shelf life of the product... I buy a brand of organic milk called Organic Life that hasn't been heated to such a high temperture that all the enzymes have been destroyed and will spoil in two days if not used. A brand of milk that seems to last forever in the refrigerator, even if it is labeled organic, should be avoided.""Kliment addresses other raw foods (meat, eggs...) in the same safe and insightful manner as she discusses milk. Even an improperly balanced vegetarian diet can potentially lead to degenerative diseases, and Kliment discusses those diets as well, providing many safe and effective dietary plans.There are so many different dietary recommendations in this book that if one doesn't suit your style, then there are others that are equally effective.Berthe Gerard",1,8.7649593170763e-69,1

"Divided Houses: Gender and the Civil War is a collection of essays pertaining to the crisis in gender relations that accompanied the Civil War in America. As a collection, the essays present a narrative that chronicles the various impacts on gender that affected men and women, the North and the South, as well as slaves and non-slaves. What emerges is a cohesive body of text that is informative, illuminating, and instructive. The themes most explored in this volume are those of empowerment through abolitionism. In The Civil War as a Crisis in Gender Relations by Leann Whites, the two groups most perceptive of the gender crisis were Northern feminists and black abolitionists. During the Civil War, the public status of motherhood increased. This leads to another theme that will later be explored in following essays, that of the State as family. In this first essay, Leann Whites argues that the Civil War created circumstances for gender equality, both diminishing white Southern male masculinity and increasing black manhood. Ideas of manhood during the Civil War are further investigated in Part II and in Reid Mitchell's Soldiering, Manhood, and Coming of Age: A Northern Volunteer. The journey from civilian to soldier was mirrored in the transition from boyhood to manhood, and the constitution of manhood evolved as a delicate balance of masculinity and manly restraint. During the Civil War, the body politic as well as the army assumed familial ties to facilitate solidarity. Despite the changes in notions of manhood, for the black male population the ""empowerment"" was not always beneficial. Jim Cullen's Gender and African-American Men details how conceptions of black manhood changed during the Civil War, with the mastery over one's own body leading to mastery in warfare. Despite being placed on some of the most dangerous fronts, black soldiers endured low pay and high disease in exchange for their mastery over their bodies. In Part III of Divided Houses: Gender and the Civil War, the themes move from issues of manhood to those relating to women. In Arranging a Doll's House: Refined Women as Union Nurses author Kristie Ross writes about female volunteers on hospital transports, and she draws from the familial theme by presenting the hospital transport as the rearrangement of a doll's house to appear domestic. Ross also reveals a sense of agency for women volunteers, claiming that many felt ""...an eagerness to seize an occasion to escape the routine pattern of their lives and a familiarity with genteel standards of household organization."" (101) Lyde Cullen Sizer's Acting Her Part: Narratives of Union Women Spies also deals with the issue of female agency during the Civil War, but Sizer further examines the repercussions women felt depending on whether they were white or black. For white women spies, their efforts were more dramatic than substantial, whereas for black abolitionists like Harriet Tubman the cause and consequences of being a spy were much more realistic. Sizer's essay is also an attempt to place female spy narratives in a literary context from which they have been excluded. Of all the essays in Divided Houses, none is more colorful and titillating than Michael Fellman's Women and Guerrilla Warfare. Through his dramatic prose, Fellman explores how peacetime morality was subverted through guerrilla warfare, with male guerrilla fighters attacking traditional values while physically attacking women. Fellman, doubtless, is presenting a form of psychological history by claiming ""there was also an additional element here of bad boys acting out against a nagging, smothering mother."" (151) For many Kansas guerrilla regiments during the Civil War, the ""freeing"" of slaves was an act of defiance rather than a moralistic pursuit. Guerrilla warfare finally reinforced the need for love, security, and family. The fourth part of Divided Houses closely examines dynamics on the Southern homefront. Peter Bardaglio's The Children of Jubilee: African-American Childhood in Wartime explains how prior to the Civil War, slave children were age-segregated but not gender-segregated. With freedom as a concept first emerging for many slaves during the Civil War, play activities among children became more gendered. Martha Hodes's Wartime Dialogues on Illicit Sex: White Women and Black Men further draws on the theme of black male power as a political issue emerging during the Civil War, which consequently led to sexuality itself becoming a political issue. With most yeoman farmers at war, the homefront became a location for ""illicit"" sex as well as the performative stage for class discord. The Southern states were not the only ones to feel the impact on gender relations that the Civil War created: Part V examines gender issues on the Northern homefront with Patricia R. Hill's Writing Out the War: Harriet Beecher Stowe's Averted Gaze. In Part VI, essays examine how the politics of Reconstruction became gendered, with Northern women beginning to campaign for the vote and new labor opportunities for African-American men and women. In spite of these advances, however, the ruling classes in the South still attempted to exert authority and black women were still subjected to southern white male violence, as evidenced in Catherine Clinton's concluding essay, Reconstructing Freedwomen. Divided Houses: Gender and the Civil War is a combination of various historiographical methodologies; cultural, social, psychological, intellectual and political, which simultaneously present a coherent and evocative study of wartime's affect on gender relations. In addition to mapping themes in gender relations during war, narratives of women's undertaking of professional and managerial duties while men were fighting in the Civil War provides a historical anchoring of the themes of female labor that were to arise again during the First, and especially Second, World War",1,6.817449184634217e-76,1

"This is a ""concise version"" of Solomon and Higgins's A Short History of Philosophy (1996) which wasn't all that short at 329 pages--well, for a history of philosophy actually it was kind of short. As the authors point out, a ""short"" history of philosophy (in German) by Hans Joachim Storig, runs to 750 pages, and Bertrand Russell's famous popular opus from 1945, A History of Philosophy was 895 pages long. What the authors have done here is to distill the essence of their larger book, mostly by judiciously pruning. The result is a witty, pithy and very well edited introduction for almost anybody interested in knowing what philosophy is all about.Speaking of Russell, the authors's treatment of him is characteristically sly: Noting that Russell turned his attention to more worldly matters after his youth (and the Principia Mathematica), they add that ""he wrote an elegant and impassioned autobiography, conclusively documenting his political commitments, his love of philosophy, and what we might politely call his love of love. He also declared--as the First World War had clearly shown--that 'the world is horrible.' Formal philosophy, by comparison, seemed both a refuge and a waste of time."" (p. 115)Solomon and Higgins cover Eastern philosophy (which many Western books do not), and they bring us up to the postmodern era, although they scrupulously avoid discussing philosophers still living--a wise decision no doubt since most of us are still trying to cope with what happen to philosophy after the logical positivists got a hold of it early in the 20th century. Solomon and Higgins also address religious philosophy, which again is right, especially when you consider that most of Western philosophy since the Greeks has been strongly influenced by Christian values and ideas--and of course, the Eastern ""philosophies"" from the Vedas, the Buddha, Lao Tzu, etc., cannot really be separated from religion.It is good to compare this to Russell's best-selling opus since Solomon and Higgins do very well exactly what Russell did very well, that is make philosophy interesting and even exciting for the general reader; and like Russell they write with unusual clarity. Unlike Russell however they refrain (mostly) from taking sides in the various philosophic disputes and they don't reveal who their favorites are. I guess I could say that Russell's approach was a critical one as he found fault with many of the icons of philosophy, even--or perhaps especially--Plato, whereas Solomon and Higgins try for a more descriptive and informative approach. I love Russell. He was a delight to me when I first read him as a teenager, but I must say that the approach of Solomon and Higgins is the more judicious.Philosophy is like history in this respect. We cannot adequately critique the ideas of today because we are so completely immersed in them that we have no real objectivity. As the authors put it so very well on page 113, ""Philosophy is never isolated or immune from its time and place, no matter how abstract it may be or however 'eternal' or 'untimely' it may declare itself. Philosophy may be prophetic, it can be nostalgic, or it can act as a mirror, a reflection of a culture. But more often than not, it expresses in abstract terms the ideals and aspirations of society.""This follows their observation that Nietzsche had predicted the horrible wars of the 20th century. Their treatment of Nietzsche (and virtually all of the philosophers) is generous although there is just the slightest hint that his ideas may have been in some part responsible for the rise of the kind of mentality exhibited by the Nazis. They recall Nietzsche's ""incredible suggestion that human beings...[are] nothing but a bridge between the ape and the Ubermensch ('superman')"" Personally, I am not a big fan of Nietzsche; nonetheless it is striking to consider that he may be exactly right: the science of the 21st century may fuse us with our machines, and through genetic engineering allow us to become something ""more"" than human.The book is in three parts, Part I: ""Is There Ultimate Truth?""; Part II: ""Faith and Reason""; and Part III: ""From Modernity to Postmodernism."" I think this is just perfect. The search for what is true and/or to what extent we can know what is true is at the very heart of the philosophic urge. And the struggle between faith and reason rages on today as it has since before the Greeks. And what we have experienced in our lifetimes is the rise of postmodernism which is a serious critique of the self-satisfied modernity that grew out of the Enlightenment.I guess what I like best about this book is a sense that it is a return to the kind of philosophy that I loved as a young man. As the authors put it, while they are excited ""by the bewildering variety of ideas"" that we have today in philosophy, they are ""at the same time...disturbed by the fact that the old ideal of philosophy, as a search for wisdom rather than a peculiar professional skill or a merely clever game, has gotten lost.""

(...)All the characters are described like they are models, or porn-stars and the other characters are evaluating them with an eye to ripping off their clothes and jumping their bones. The main POV character, a woman, is one of the worst offenders and a disgusting stereotype of a women who only goes through life with one aim: trapping her man, while thinking with her anatomy. She acts and dresses like a bimbo, but then she becomes enraged when she garners male attention. Males are bashed as the root of all evil, for both sex, love, and practical matters. Eventually the main character has wild quasi-public sex, and for a bit it seems like the story and the science mystery might gain the upper hand. But that is when more male bashing comes to the fore. The men who aren't bed-boys are arrogant, macho, and blinded by their own stupidity. The main character now has to protect science and scientists from murderous Marines. The mystery does pop up and get interesting again. (...)",1,0.026159033907562704,0.9738409660924373
"Mark M. Smith has given us a splendid account of the 1739 Slave Revolt in the Charleston, South Carolina area. Rather than simply giving us his interpretation of this important, yet not widely studied event, Smith gives us the opportunity to look at some of the key documents relating to the uprising and then provides the reader with four separate essays to show different interpretations of the documents.The essays Smith presents are written by well recognized historians, including one by Smith himself, and vary in analysis - we see such concepts forwarded as the idea that the rebelling slaves were mainly ex-military, that these male slaves revolted because they were pushed into agricultural work that they saw as ""women's work"", and that the slaves revolved on September 9, 1739 because of the religious significance of the date.All told, this book will make an exceptionally useful case study of this revolt, and the presentation of the material makes it a most valuable addition to the field of historiography and training of future historians in how documents may be interpreted differently to come up with the ""real"" picture of what happened in the past",1,1.8576462850870584e-08,0.9999999814235372

In particular, the additional material on multiprocessors is especially welcome, given that it has become much more difficult to speed up uniprocessors.Most people who work in or near computer systems architecture know these books, but I have often recommended them to others, such as technology journalists, venture capitalists, and financial analysts, i.e., people who are rarely computer archtiects, but need to understand computer technology and its trends. Many such have been surprised to find the book was useful to them.H&P write very clearly, and each chapter outlines its key concepts for a topic, then works down to detailed analyses, and then comes back up to summarize. hence, I've often recommended to people:1) Read the first few sections of each chapter.2) In each remaining section per chapter, read until the going gets heavy, then skip to the next section. In some cases, this will happen after reading the first paragraph, but don't worry, the writing will return to a higher level.3) Read ""Concluding Remarks"" and any ""Fallacies and Pitfalls"" or Historical Perspectives"" sections at the end of a chapter.Anyway, I expect this Edition will be just as indispensable as the earlier ones",1,1.0017975058405244e-06,0.9999989982024942

"This book changed my life! I couldn't put it down and the tragic though triumphant stories will never leave my mind. Susan Bergman, who writes with all the beauty of classic authors, shares the stories of many different modern-day martyrs. The pain and sorrow these people endured are beyond comprehension and yet their faith in Christ sustained them to the very end of their lives. The legacy of faith and hope that these 'Spiritual Giants' left behind are worth their weight in gold. Foxe's Book of Martyrs illuminated many a generation on the reality of Christian martyrdom but this book is for the present generation. We are called to suffer many things and this book reminds us that it is all for a wonderful purpose. God's Glory",1,5.1767247517475756e-61,1
"While I have admired those with the ""Do-It-Yourself"" attitude, people who set out to publish and distribute their own writings and art, I've never really been a participant in the independent printing movement. It has been a lifelong dream of mine to have some of my work published by a nationwide distributor with fine binding and all that jazz. Little did I know I could show people my work now with little more than a copier, some staples, and a stolen Sharpie.Stolen Sharpie Revolution is a very small but intricately designed book that tells you everything you need to know about creating your own Zine. Alex Wrekk, who's been self-publishing since 1995, provides thoughtful suggestions for laying out pages, printing and binding, distributing your work, and raising awareness of free-speech independent zines in your community. The simple, clean, stylish layout of the book is inspiring, as it looks like something anyone can do with a bit of planning. In addition to all her helpful tips, Wrekk has compiled a listing of zine distributors, libraries, communities, and websites. This book is a great starting point for anyone considering self-publishing, and for a mere $4.00, you can't go wrong! Jump in a let your voice be heard",1,2.4860889338625462e-42,1
"This book is a reproduction of the classic out of print book entitled ""Book of the Fallacy: A Training Manual for Intellectual Subversives"", which is one of the greatest and wittiest books ever written about fallacies and argument I've ever read.I'm happy to see that it is now available again - for a reasonable price, because it makes a wonderful gift especially for young adults, or for anyone who would enjoy learning to win arguments.I equate this book in importance to a parent teaching their child boxing to defend themselves on the playground. This book teaches how to defend themselves in debate, where one's opponent will cry uncle from a few well placed ""argumentum ad ignorantiam"" or a couple ""tu quoque"" with a swift kick in the rump from a well placed ""red herring"" as they scamper a way and submit in defeat.If there is any question of the value this book has to us ""fallacy buffs"", simply look at the used book prices for the original book, and thank your lucky stars that it is now available again.Madsen Pirie is the master",1,1.3577183127364196e-10,0.9999999998642282
"Dunn does an excellent job of explaining the planter class in the West Indies. His research is excellent and his writing style is clear and devoid of that crazy academic jargon so often found in history books. This is my first book on planters and it gave me a good fund of knowledge on the histories of Barbados, the Leeward Islands, and Jamaica, and it outlined in detail how the planters made or lost money. For me, it's Dunn's careful unraveling of the planters' financial arrangements and entanglements that made this book absolutely hard to put down!",1,2.322305994954391e-183,1

"I was born during WWII in 1943, and during the 1950's while yet in high school became aware of Winston Churchill. During later military and college years gained even further appreciation and admiration for the man, the leader, and the politician. Here at Amazon I have written at least a couple reviews of recent books about him or written by him.In the last couple years it seems we have either gained an appreciation of him or at the least developed a need to investigatingly write about him. Books have been rolling off the press at an all time high on Winston Churchill, with this author beginning his book by asking the question: ""Another book on Churchill?"".My home library shelves hold many volumes about Winston Churchill, and while having all six of his hardcover WWII books, am considering ordering at least two additional recent volumes about him. This book I'm reviewing is one of them (I checked it out of our local library in order to review and to read before purchasing).Winston himself had been quoted as saying that he could hardly wait to read WWII history because he intended to write most of it! And as this author also states Churchill is quoted in May, 1938, as saying ""words are the only things that last for ever"".When one admires Winston Churchill as I have nigh on to 50 years, one must if realistic, accept him flaws and all. He was as human as any of us and imperfect in many ways, and anytime I light a Cuban cigar, it's difficult not to think of him. Coming away from this book as The Daily Telegraph has stated: ""This book leaves you admiring the man more, not less"".He was a hard man to know, and an even more difficult man to work with or for. Even the two American men most close to him during the WWII years, Eisenhower and Roosevelt, were at many times overshadowed by both Churchill's intellect and abilities. And as Winston alluded to on on the floor of Congress had his parentage been different, he might have made it there himself. Who knows with his ambition and abilities we might have even had him as one of our presidents!As soon as I knew this book was coming out I intended to both read and buy it. It will be a welcome addition to anyone who is an admirer of Winston Churchill. While he did need the money these books brought in, he could not know how successful they would be, nor just how much they would enrich him, both as an author and as an eventual millionaire.If a reader has any interest in Winston Churchill, this book cannot be bypassed.Semper Fi",1,0.3774780635695615,0.6225219364304385
"""The term [Professional Learning Communities] has become so commonplace and has been used so ambiguously to describe virtually any loose coupling of individuals who share a common interest in education that it is in danger of losing all meaning.""Really? Thank goodness the authors of LEARNING BY DOING have returned with a fifth book (and CD!) on Professional Learning Communities to clarify things and distinguish their PLC from all those cheap imitators. Plus, it's important that teachers, the pawns currently tasked with implementing the PLC concept by fad-chasing school administrators all across the land, be set straight. Where would we be without these enlightened swamis to point the way? Not teaching, that's for sure!So what exactly is a Professional Learning Community? In Chapter 1 of LEARNING BY DOING, our puissant authors spell out their definition of PLC in only four short pages, using plain, simple language that is refreshingly free of educratic clichés. Lest we all die of suspense, let's review what the Holy Scripture Saith. PLC's are defined by:""A Focus on Learning"": Because schools have never focused on that before, have they?""A Collaborative Culture with a Focus on Learning For All"": Interdependence, collaboration, and collectivism are key to PLC. Anyone caught thinking for themselves, or by themselves, will be ritually sacrificed in the next round of campus budget-cuts.""Collective Inquiry into Best Practice and Current Reality"" [NB: This statement and the passage that follow it are not translatable into any written or spoken language that I'm aware of, including English. I thought I was a professional teacher, but because I don't understand a word the authors said on this page, according to them I'm not a professional at all. If anyone can tell me what it means, please e-mail or fax me. I wait with bated breath; apparently my job depends on it.]""Action Orientation: Learning by Doing"" [Ditto this statement. Although, speaking of breath, doesn't the act of breathing signify an ""action orientation""?]""Results Orientation"" [Now that I've caught my breath, the only tangible result of PLC that I can discern is that any teacher who refuses to play ball with the PLC cultists should plan on early retirement or a change of career.]I could go on, but why bother? Until teachers themselves start standing up and asserting intellectual authority over their profession, the educrats and charlatans behind PLC will have us chasing our own tails until the end of time, or until they find another gimmick to fiddle with. And all at the expense of our students, who deserve far better.",1,3.2570556171799e-06,0.9999967429443828

"Fantastic read. Goodwin makes well-travelled history new again by focusing specifically on Lincoln, his cabinet, and how he dealt with the various political conflicts during the civil war. Excellent description of how Lincoln played off the various factions to unite the North. NOT about specific battles, except in their political context, and very brief at that (Gettysburg occupies all of three pages, though the address covers a bit more paper). NOT particularly about the generals either, except how they interacted with Lincoln and his cabinet. It's a long read, and you won't get through it very fast, but it's worth it! I learned a lot about Seward, Bates, Stanton, and Chase. Ideal for those interested in a different side of the civil war, those interested in Lincoln, or those interested in American political history",1,3.706242061078429e-21,1

"This book by the Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce is well written in clear terms with summaries and simple graphics. It is a must read for anyone interested in the future of the US economy. The Commission points out the risks of our poor pre-university education to the US economy. India and China are now competing with the US in the high skilled labor market (not just low skilled) and at lower wages. With the Internet, many jobs can be done anywhere, and companies will hire the best at the lowest cost (Indian engineers make $7500 annually with the same qualifications as US engineers who make $45,000). The Commission describes how US universities continue to be the best in the world, but grade schools and high schools have fallen behind. In the 20th century the US pioneered universal education, and received an influx of talent, from scientists fleeing Germany before World War II to a more recent influx of Asian students, who stayed and worked here. But now, other countries have passed us in pre-university education and many foreign students are going back to their own countries after graduating.""A Nation at Risk"" came out in 1983, saying ""If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre education performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war."" The Tough Choices Commission points out that since then we've had a more than doubling of spending on education (inflation adjusted) with only modest improvement. The Commission concludes that the main improvement, standards testing, turns out to be misguided because it is multiple choice, not essay, and thus doesn't teach the creative, out of the box thinking needed for the US to maintain its lead. Multiple choice tests are by definition ""in the box"" tests. ""A Nation at Risk"" proposals in 1983 for merit pay for teachers were resisted, and teachers continue to come from the bottom 1/3 of University graduates. The Commission proposes merit pay for new teachers, with an opt-in choice for existing teachers, combined with higher salaries made possible by eliminating pensions and using 401Ks instead, like other professions. Other proposals include universal pre-school, school choice with funding following students, less bureaucracy and more independence for individual schools, adult education coordinated with the business community, and inter-city schools and supporting social services being coordinated under one person, such as the mayor. Finally, partial funding can be found by reducing the number of students in the last 2 years of high school by allowing board testing at the 10th grade, with those passing going to community college then a university, directly to trade school, or directly to work.I have separately read that having funding follow the student to encourage competition among schools has been implemented successfully at the city level in San Francisco. The Commission shows that if pensions and vacation time are included, current teacher salaries are actually somewhat competitive. But talented young people prefer money now, and don't know that they would stay in teaching long enough to earn a pension. Thus, pension money could be moved to up front salary and portable 401Ks, with existing teachers having the option of opting in or staying with their pensions.The proposal to coordinate social services with schooling to help the disadvantaged, such as by putting all under a mayor has been done in New York recently, with great success. By providing programs for kids until 5 PM, and help to their families, the disadvantages of a poor home situation can be addressed. The US economy is healthy because of the waves of immigration it has had over the past 15 years, and we can't afford not to train those immigrants so our business have a talented labor pool to draw on.The board exams proposed at the end of the 10th grade will provide badly needed motivation to students, since they can get out of school earlier if they work harder, rather than marking time.To cut bureaucracy, the commission proposed principals be given free reign on how to spend the money they get (which is based on the number of students). Also, school boards would not run schools, but would contract with others (such as private companies, groups of teachers, etc.). The school boards would then become performance contract managers.Finally, the report proposes training of people in the workforce, since these people will be the largest part of our workforce for some time, and will need more advanced and creative skills.",1,1.784784926009747e-45,1
"The content and artwork of this book is as charming as any in the Madeline series, but it is marred by the blatant ethnic stereotyping of gypsies (the Romani people) as unclean, work-shy itinerants. Little enough is known about true Romani culture by most people today. Stereotypes like these only make the situation worse. Yes, the gypsy mother shown is loving. No one in the book is evil. But who would dare recommend a children's book that showed a kindly black mother whose family lifestyle epitomized racist stereotypes of unintelligent and lazy African-Americans?

"A discussion of fees is something with which many consultants are somewhat uncomfortable, and hourly billings may be an attempt to show we are not ripping the client off. Alan Weiss shows the absurdity and conflict of interest inherent in time based fees - to make more money you are tempted to stretch out your assignments. The buyer on the other hand while watching the meter run, is motivated in the opposite direction. Value is the victim here. The book places the responsibility for educating the buyer about value, squarely on the consultant.The proper basis for fees, according to Alan Weiss, are client results rather than time or material inputs. Prior conceptual agreement, your belief in the unique contribution you bring to the assignment, and your ability to create a win/win dynamic by providing a choice of yeses all through will enhance your ability to charge based on value.For existing clients, you are advised to gradually transit them to your new fee strucure, while offering even greater value.Also treated in the book are how to manage retainers, sixty suggestions for raising your fees, methods for handling the four basic types of objection, and non-consulting opportunities.All consultants who want to escape having their services treated like a commodity should read this book.",1,2.0058231886797082e-08,0.999999979941768

"This is a brilliant piece of crime fiction that earned its 5 stars from the first chapter through to the last. In a fictitious northern England town 4 young men have been found murdered with their bodies showing evidence of the most gruesome torture before death. All the broken bodies have been meticulously washed spotlessly clean of any obvious forensic evidence such as blood, skin, hair, fibres or the like which could provide a link to the killer. The police force is split between old-fashioned coppers with their traditional crime solving methods and the forward thinking university educated detectives who know that modern tools and techniques are what are required. The decision to bring in criminal psychologist Tony Hill to come up with a profile of the killer is thus a divisive one. The old-time detective leading the manhunt will not admit that there may be a serial killer on his patch, preferring to let the public think it is merely a wave or unrelated murders. The early conclusion by Tony Hill that it is certainly the work of a serial killer further alienates him from the chief investigator.Author Val McDermid allows us to read the diary of the psychopath as an introduction to each chapter, keeping up a parallel story in the same time frame. We see how each victim is selected and stalked in the lead up to his capture. We also see how the killer selects the torture instrument of choice and designs, builds and tests it. McDermid cleverly researches these mediaeval instruments. Hill's main support from within the crime squad is Detective Inspector Carol Jordan who campaigned successfully for the services of a criminal psychologist. A tenuous relationship gradually builds up between Carol and Tony, which despite their best efforts strays just beyond the professional. This relationship provides an element of relief and romance from the otherwise black storyline. The whole story is beautifully written and each character comes to life with his or her foibles, weaknesses and strengths. The plot is well conceived, well developed and the tension allowed to build to breaking point as the climax is reached.",1,5.986721844623572e-138,1
"If you can get your hands on this long out-of-print book on the religions of Melanesia, do so because it is certainly worth it. One of the earliest ethnographies of the region, this book focuses in on Australian New Guinea (now Papua New Guinea; kinda suggests how much has changed since this book came out) and the New Hebrides. The introduction explains much about this region, and also makes a point of calling it &quot;religion&quot; as opposed to &quot;mythology&quot;, &quot;legends&quot;, &quot;magic&quot; or whatever. I strongly am in favor of recognizing indigenous religions so I found that to be excellent. From there, each chapter focuses in on a particular tribe or group of tribes. Tribes covered include the Huli (southern highlands), Siane (northern highlands), Kamano, Usurufa, Jate and Fore (all eastern highlands), the Mae Enga and Kayaka (western highlands), the Lakalai of New Britain, the Ngaing (Rai coast), Tangu (of the northern Madang district) and the islanders of South Pentecost and the New Hebredies. Each chapter exploes their myths, history, religious beliefs, ceremonies, deities and magical practices in fairly good detail. Strong patterns can be seen emerging between coastal groups and highland groups. As the book points out, with Christianity's arrival in Melanesia many of these beliefs have changed. Some have since died out, others changed and adopted Christian elements and still others have been preserved in tact as an act of defense against the religion of their colonial oppressors. Even today, this change continues. Most interesting is the rebirth of Melanesian culture in some areas where it has been long gone. In summary though, this book is a wonderful historical glimpse at some of the many religions of the South Pacific",1,7.021520125642609e-81,1
"This work was the central text for a seminary course in Hermeneutics, and I had anticipated a somewhat dry, calculated, formula based approach to Biblical interpretation. What I received was a tool chest of invaluable exegetical tools with which to treat the Word of the Living God with the highest honor that it deserves. Drs. Kaiser and Silva are very obviously not only theologians and scholars of the first order, they are lovers of God's Word, and they pursue Him in their lives and work. Their instruction shines the very passion of knowing and following Jesus, while using every intellectual tool that He has given us.

"This tiny little book is an absolute gem of simplicity, love and hope. A precociously aware, yet innocent little girl has been left with the owner of a struggling restuarant and his wife, to raise, by her mother, a woman on the fringes of show business, who cares for no one but herself. The child, Lovejoy, becomes obsessed with the idea of creating a garden in the ruins of a bombed out church, and enlists the aid of a local boy, Tip Malone. When they remove earth from a nearby enclosed garden, they are prosecuted by Miss Angela Chesney, an opinionated, domineering woman who can see no other path in life except her own, and who rules even her elder, more compassionate sister with the iron fist of mockery. It's a short story but one which made me laugh and cry because I could feel the sheer frustration, as well as the determination of Lovejoy as she battles the inexorable might of the adult world, a world which can not, or will not, see things from a child's perspective. I'm sorry that I've missed this beautiful book until now, but am grateful to have found it in an op-shop",1,2.1020984826095493e-65,1

"I am an 18 year-old senior in High School, and I have read Carol Ellison's Women's Sexualities for my Psychology AP class. Reading about other, more experienced women's sexual experiences has helped me define my own views of sexuality, and has given me a chance that not every girl has, to learn from my elders the mistakes not to make. Ellison's book is detailed, informative, and interesting. It is well-written, and she gives many view-points for each topic, showing what happens rather than what should happen to women sexually. I recommend this book to any women who wants to know what other women experience. I especially recommend this book to teenage girls on the brink of adulthood, around the time that they start to experiment sexually, and young-adult males who want to understand the experiences of their girlfriends.

"As with his previous books, James Hollis offers no easy answers, no magic formula for happiness, no 10 or 12 or 20 simple steps -- which explains the disappointment of some previous reviewers, I guess, who obviously wanted the hard work done for them. But isn't that one of the most pernicious illusions we have to shed, if we truly want to find personal meaning? We have to accept that *we've* got to do the digging, the discovering, the accepting. Even if we have helpful guides along the way, in the end it's up to us, since an adult is ultimately responsible for his/her life.So Hollis presents us with the tough questions, the ones we need to ask ourselves without flinching or making excuses for our hesitancy & failures. The poetry, the excerpts from literature & myth, are potent models & examples for us -- not to follow blindly, but to mull over & use as illumination for our own lives. Striving for wholeness & authenticity isn't easy, which is why so many step away from it more than once, unwilling to go forward. But it's the only worthwhile goal for life, especially the second half of life. Once we realize that our time is limited, that we must find or make our own meaning, rather than depending on others to provide it -- well, once you feel that in your gut, in the marrow of your bones, then you know there's simply no time to waste on self-imposed obstacles or distractions. Every day is precious, and should be put to good use. Whatever has wounded us in the past, whatever has hampered us, can no longer be used as an excuse: once we see & know what restrains us, then we're responsible for dealing with it. The choice is ours ... and perhaps that's what's so terrifying for some people.So here is a book to read, contemplate, and then read again. It doesn't promise instant happiness, only the prospect of hard but rewarding work. The quest for personal meaning awaits, and sooner or later we've all got to embark upon it. Most highly recommended",1,1.8464962962026616e-200,1

"Dr. Gordon Fee's commentary on 1 Corinthians is one of the best commenataries on one of the most problomatic books in the NT. Scholars often debate the issues of 1 Corinthians such as the issue of the sexual immoral man in chapter five, the sexual purity of the Corinthians themselves in chapter six, the issues of the Lord's supper in chapter eleven, and the gifts of tongues and prophecy in chapters twelve through fourteen. Dr. Fee dives into the book of 1 Corinthians with careful exegesis of the texts. He is a charismatic in his own practice but he is often critical of charismatic abuses within the spiritual gifts context of the book. Fee is also one who is not ashamed to put the words of those who might disagree with him in this work. All Greek words are transliterated for those who do not know Greek.Overall this is a solid work on 1 Corinthians. While it lacks the expository outlines of Dr. John MacArthur's commentaries, it remains one of the deepest and best I've read on 1 Corinthians to date",1,7.755230752996553e-15,0.9999999999999922

"As a pastor who has been in ministry for over three decades, it takes depth plus reality to capture my attention. With Soul Physicians, Dr. Kellemen combines these two traits that are all too rare today: truth and love. I first read his second volume, Spiritual Friends, and was amazed by the practical model of sustaining, healing, reconciling, and guiding; and even more amazed to learn that it has been around for 2,000 years. Where have I been? And where have seminaries been in not teaching this? That motivated me to grab hold of this theological volume. I thought maybe it would be deep but boring or shallow but sweet. Instead, it provides new insights into age-old issues that my parishioners face every day--that I face every day! Each chapter was like a devotional taught by a seasoned theologian. I didn't want to finish it. Now I'm buying it for my friends in the ministry and for the lay leaders at our church. Indispensable",1,3.601565792163727e-35,1
"My son just turned 2 and is starting to show an interest in potty training, so I got several books for him...this one is definitely his favorite.

The text is nice (a lot of rhyming), though some of the words are too sophisticated for him...he doesn't seem to mind.

"Solnit's juxtaposition of the insidious nuclear poisoning of Nevada to the making of Yosemite National Park (that she shows has been &quot;loved to death&quot; since it was first discovered by whites more than 150 years ago)makes this book a must for all environmentalists. Solnit deals directly with themes of conquest and redemption in historic efforts to both tame and use these lands. Readers gain specific understanding about two places that are, after all, national icons. However, the deeper themes so well-developed in this book are being played out no less dramtically all across the country",1,1.831402007504883e-142,1
"Stoicism is the Philosophy of Choice. It emphasizes emotional responsibility, physical and intellectual temperance, and spiritual connection to a world beyond thoughts and words. The basics tenets of all Stoics are as follows:- I always have a choice. My impulses, whether emotionally or physically based, can be controlled by my Will. I can choose to react to them or to ignore them. - The choices of others only effect me in so far as I allow them to effect me. I Will myself into the role of victim or victor. These are choices. No one can harm me.- I choose to engage life rather than disengage from life. For a Will is best when it is tempered in action.The texts included in this book, written by Arrian, cover a myriad examples of these principles applied in life, as well as a large set of refutations of what the author construes as contrary philosophies. (The schools of Cynicism and the Epicurean are the main adversaries here.) Of the current English editions available, the Everyman Library's version is by far the most comprehensive collection.Why one of the reviewers below felt compelled to outline (rather clumsily) the differences between Epictetus and Jesus is beyond my field of study, but I can say that I find the two ""philosophies"" (for, in truth, Jesus offers not just a philosophy but a faith) quite complimentary. Gandhi thought so too, and his philosophy of satyagraha was a rare combination of both. As any student of Stoicism will find, the one tenet missing from the Stoic lexicon is the following:- I cannot say that he/she/it/they always has/have a choice.Adding this statement to the lot makes for a healthier dose of compassion in the Stoic system, and decreases the risk of the Stoic becoming apathetic or wooden. (Both characteristics condemned by Epictetus.)Readers who enjoy this work might also like Heraclitus's ""Fragments"" (although not a Stoic, he is oft quoted by Stoics as an antecedent ""member"" of the Stoic school), ""Gandhi On Non-Violence"", and Thich Nhat Hahn's ""Living Buddha, Living Christ."" They make interesting complimentary works.Those looking for a list of Stoic literature should keep in mind that the genuine article is fairly spartan. Most were written by Romans or Roman subjects well after the deaths of the more imminent exemplars. Marcus Aurelius is a notable exception, as are Cicero and Seneca (although one might argue that these latter two were more apologists for Stoicism rather than actual Stoics.) As such, one often finds true Stoicism in daubs and subtle hues rather than in strong, available works. Look at Seneca's ""On the Shortness of Life"" or ""Letters From a Stoic"" to see what I mean.",1,9.24297717944942e-210,1
"Authority: Under New Management reprints Authority vol. 1 #9-16, easily my favorite issues of this series, and among my favorite comics of all time. In the last volume, Authority: Relentless, Ellis introduced the team and became comfortable with the characters. It was all leading up to this. In ""Outer Dark"" (#9-12) the team faces their strangest, strongest threat yet. At first a few alien creatures appear that are nearly invincible, taking the entire team to defeat. Then the horror of the situation is revealed. The threat is nothing more or less than `god'- the creator of the world who wants the planet back. The worst thing about the planet in `god's' eyes is annoying humans are all over it, so they need to be removed. To make matters worse, the leader of the Authority- Jenny Sparks- is not at her best. Not the best of times to say the least. This is easily Hitch's and Ellis's best work together. It has the feel to it the creators had fun with this book, and that fun feeling is highly contagious. I just can't sing enough praises about this arch. ""The Nativity"" has a lot of changes, both on the creative staff and the characters in the book. The story revolves around a baby of immeasurable power. With Jenny Sparks gone from the team, Jack steps up as leader. However, Authority is not the only ones looking for the baby. A fleet of superheroes are also after the child. The main ones featured are a lot like a twisted version of Ultimates. Keep in mind, this is written by the Ultimates scribe, Mark Millar. There's also twisted versions of almost every Marvel hero here, and in the background of the Carrier, look for Gen 13 cameos. Though a lot of people think the Millar and Quietly combo was worse than Ellis and Hitch, I don't think so. Yes, the book changed, but it is still the outrageous, irreverent book we all know and love. This is a bloody brilliant graphic and WELL worth the money. It's mature readers, that's my only caution. Other than that, get a copy for you, a copy for your friends and enjoy!",1,1.2770010379430902e-68,1

"Somehow, I'd graduated from college - with a degree in English, no less - and had never had to read a single thing ever written by Charles Dickens. I read quite a bit on my own, but still found David Copperfield to be the height of ambition - my copy was 1001 pages long, and I hadn't ventured into a book over a thousand pages since I'd read The Stand at age 12. I cannot imagine that I am alone in completing my education and sidestepping Dickens altogether, so I think it's important I share my experience. In truth, the only reason I chose David Copperfield over, say, Great Expectations or Hard Times was the passing comment made by Jeff Daniels in The Squid And The Whale - dismissing a Tale of Two Cities as ""minor Dickens,"" saying David Copperfield was ""much richer.""It is rich. I tend towards modern fiction nowadays, fiction that, unexpectedly, takes you deep inside the heart of its characters sometimes bewildering behavior and humanity. What strikes me about the complex nature of the characters in Copperfield is the way it seems that no effort at all has been used to distinguish each of them, yet there is no doubt as to how vivid they are. Each character speaks in a tone that is a perfect elucidation of who they are - you can hear, just in the dialogue, the calm wisdom of Agnes, the parasitic obsequiousness of Uriah Heep, the punctilious rambling of Micawber, the pleasantries that barely mask the aggression of Miss Dartle, the rigid boredom of the Murdstones, the spoiled impishness when Dora speaks (so precise I heard her voice in cloying and nasal babytalk in my head). It's a delicate balancing act to keep this level of detail so hidden in his work, and it makes the plot machinations speedy and exciting. The varied heights in this book astound - moments of drama, whimsy, intrigue, romance abound, and the book is even prone to its bit of slapstick - midgets falling over into umbrellas, or extreme umbrage taken when donkeys appear on lawns. What I mean is that it's easy to know you ""should"" read David Copperfield, but as anyone who's ever had a reading assignment knows, that doesn't necessarily make it something you'd want to do. I know, in a way, that David Copperfield is considered a standard - a book Tolstoy and Virginia Woolf, for example, hold as the pinnacle of English fiction - but then again, I slogged my way through supposed classics in school that, over time, have turned out to appear dull and unsurprising. David Copperfield is so underread these days that I had no idea what to expect, no notion of the amazing surprises within, the sublimely addictive cadence of Dickens' prose, the dazzle of his language. Reading it for no particular reason, then, was a triumph all around - a book that doesn't require a degree to ""understand,"" that moves breezily through its pages, and that teaches a thing or two (or twenty) about the rich heights capable in fiction. It's as rich and winning as you've heard and then some",1,3.146616992732607e-129,1
"I am a mom with 2 kids in elementary school. I bought and read this book after meeting Rafe and his students on a book tour they were doing. I read it in every spare moment I had. I am incredibly grateful for this book. It gave me wonderful insights into children. It gave me some really great, creative ideas on how to teach and parent them. It gave me hope that it IS possible to raise children to LOVE learning and also to become kind human beings. Furthermore, witnessing Rafe's struggles, through his stories, and seeing that he could maintain, and even build his love for his profession (and dedication to it) over the years, greatly encouraged me. I am not a teacher, but the types of opposition he encounters in the school system are also found in other professions, organizations and other aspects of life. In fact, the principles Rafe teaches for dealing with immature, mean and unreasonable people, and with difficult circumstances, are taught in many other circles, such as the business world, sports and religion. They are universal principles that relate to becoming a successful person, a leader, and a great human being. This book is easy to read, since it basically a collection of true stories, with wisdom and insights sprinkled in. Rafe is sincere, and he has one of the most generous hearts I have seen. I highly recommend this book for anyone. And I think it is a MUST-READ for anyone with a responsibility towards raising children",1,6.957273951391562e-37,1

"Reissued in August 2006, the novel is part of the Dirk Pitt series; an ongoing character from Clive Cussler.The action surrounds a U.S. aircraft, Vixen 03, that crashes in a Colorado lake in 1954. It contained 36 quick-death germ bombs, but two are missing when Pitt and his pals find the sunken plane some 30 years later.The missing canisters are in the hands of some bad guys whose mission is to sail a battleship up the Potomic River and unleash the bombs on Washington. D.C.The premise is a bit silly and the writing is highly dated (the novel was initially published in the 1970s). Pitt seemingly has super-hero qualities - without having to dress in a phone-booth - and his pals always seem to arrive just in the nick of time to grab victory out of the clutches of defeat. I was waiting for ""zowie,"" ""pow,"" and ""bam"" to roll from the pages as the good guys battle those pesky evil-doers!The novel sets up well to the point of the discovery of the aircraft and Pitt piecing together the mystery surrounding the crash. After that, it becomes a tepid battle against time, with a sophomoric ending worthy of a creative writing class, circa 7th Grade.",1,0.44966845423465873,0.5503315457653413

"Mr. Nugent's treatise on the rights of lawful citizens to be armed for their own defense, and the value of hunting as a vital life skill. It is also somewhat biographical. Mr. Nugent tells it in the style that only he can! Ted Nugent has recieved an undue barrage of criticism from screaming hysterical leftists, merely because he is one of the very few people in the public spotlight to really speak his mind. The part that enrages the leftos the most, is that Nugent's opinions are based on fact and logic. The best they can do is disparage him for some long past alledged immature behavior in the earlier years of his music career. However, when compared to the absolutely repulsive behavior of the vast majority of so-called ""celebrities"" of ""pop-culture"", Ted Nugent's so-called scandals are quite minor. A major point of this book is the issue of a citizen's absolute right to be armed. The leftists think this a ""liberal versus conservative"" issue, it most definitely is not! The main point is, that free, law-abiding people have the right to defend themselves against criminal assault, it is the most basic human-right. Part of that right is possession of the tools or arms to enable you to protect yourself, your family, and associates. This is a right of every living person.

"A student gave me this book. Now I assign The Israelis in my university sociology class and students -- Jews, Christians, Muslims and Buddhists -- love it. It's lively, balanced and fascinating. The best book about contemporary Israelis I know.Israelis of very different backgrounds -- youth, high techies, soldiers, Jews, Moslems, Christians, left and right wing -- tell me this is THE most outstanding, accurate and up-to-date book written about them in years. My colleagues in Israel, Germany and Japan are assiging it too. The Israelis focuses on ordinary people, not the politicians. It smashes stereotypes. No better way to understand the many types of today's Israelis, from very modern to very traditional. And half of them are women.No matter who you are - university or high school student; priest, pastor, immam; Israeli, Arab; tourist, business person, or diplomat - you'll read and REread THE ISRAELIS. It's wonderfully written, packed with information and let's Israelis speak in their own voices.It's a mind opening gift for Jews, Christians and Muslims of all ages and outlooks.",1,3.570937185330992e-36,1
"Power Up examines video games in general, and Japanese video games in particular, as an interactive storytelling medium. But video games were not always regarded as art - Japanese influence pioneered cinematic techniques that transformed games from primitive, non-story plaything such as the classic Pong to sweeping epic sagas such as the hero's complex journey in role-playing games like Final Fantasy 7. Though non-Japanese games are included in the discussion, Power Up especially examines how storytelling ideas in Japanese videogames have so thoroughly permeated the gaming world, from the first-ever game cutscenes in Donkey Kong onward. Author and dedicated game fan Chris Kohler presents his research of and personal interviews with industry movers and shakers such as Shigeru Miyamoto (creator of Mario), Hideo Kojima (designer of Metal Gear Solid), and many more. The impact of classic series on game storytelling and narrative include discussions of specific series such as a Mario games, Pokemon, Final Fantasy, and Grand Theft Auto among others. Black-and-white photographs and screenshots illustrate this fascinating exploration of everything from how videogame music evolved from bleeps and boops to full-symphony orchestras to the adventures that might await any truly hardcore gaming fan who dares to shop in Akihabara. Though Power Up concentrates especially on video game history, references to modern developments up through 2004 keep this survey current. A highly recommended treat for gamers in particular, and a valuable resource for students and researchers seeking to better understand the cultural shifts in video games as a communicative, interactive, expressive artistic medium as vibrant (and popular!) in its own right as books and movies.",0,0.9988963660553505,0.0011036339446496032

"I'm surprised to see some of the bad reviews here. I throughly enjoyed this book and finished it in a day. While some may see the plots and characters ""formulaic"", heck, they work-and I might add,similar plotlines have worked for some of bestselling romance writers as well for years. ""If it ain't broke why fix it?"" Logan is a great ""tortured"" hero. 30, been around the block and then some with many lovers, but had only one ""true""love that betrayed him. Madeline is the perfect yin to his yang. Sweet, full of love and patience, but still a strong woman. Unlike others, I found it likable that here is a regency heroine who refused to sit back and be betrothed to a truly horrid person just because it's the ""right"" thing for her parents interests. She was willing to accept whatever fate her actions caused, and that would have been huge in those days.It was refreshing to see characters, hero & heroine both, who were basically abused growing up (he was physically, she was neglected/emotionally put down) that went on with their lives and became productive members of society rather than let their misfortune make then abusive themselves. The sub-plot dealing with these issues were very engrossing to read.The playhouse storyline was refreshing as most regencies deal strictly with the ""ton"", so this was a unique change of pace. This book struck me as similar in chemistry and plot movement to some other well known authors like Johanna Lindsey and Amanda Quick. I think Miss Kleypas has a long and illustrious career ahead of her and will in time become as popular as some of these authors if not more.The love scenes are highly sensual-I found nothing ""icky"" about the fact that she was 18 and he 30-hell, the man her parents wanted her for was probably at least 50, so what's the big deal? Marriages with this age difference were common in this time period, so I didn't find it implausible in the least.BTW-I think some reviewers of romances here should get a grip-it's just a romance people! If you have the need to nitpick every little nuance, ""historical accuracy"" and scene-MAYBE you should try reading another genre, Duh??!!? Potential buyers should take a few bad reviews with a grain of salt. If you enjoy romances for the pure entertainment that they are, then I feel you'll enjoy this book.Highly entertaining, highly recommended 5 stars",1,5.444190406726201e-131,1

"Since the Renaissance much of the Western worldview has been dominated by an Aristotelian scepticism and naturalism. In a response to this unbiblical philosophy many Christian authors today have espoused a neo-pagan dualism, supported by questionable empiricism rather than inductive biblical exegesis.

"One-volume histories of World War II are about a dime a dozen. Most of them seem to have the words ""Cambridge"" or ""Oxford"" in their titles, ignore the Pacific war, and are deadly dull. For an American, Miller and Commager's book is the best one-volume history I have found. I say ""for an American"" because the focus is on battles in which Americans were the participants. The brutal Eastern front and the war between Germany and the Soviet Union get short shrift; the spectacular air, land and sea battles of the war between the U.S. and Japan get equal attention with the Western Front battles in Europe. Miller doesn't spend a whole lot of time on the events leading up to the war. On page 19 Germany invades Poland and the same breakneck speed in moving from one major battle to another continues. The analysis of the strategy and politics behind the war is succinct but adequate to enable the reader to understand the big picture. What makes this history better than others is the reliance of the authors on the words of the participants in the combat. One half or more of the narrative consists of quotes from eyewitnesses -- mostly soldiers and journalists -- and this gives a worms-eye view of events that seems more valid, and certainly more interesting, that the detached analysis of many writers. This book gives you a good picture and what life was likein the front lines. The text is supplemented by many good photos and maps. If you are an American and you can only afford to buy one book on World War II, this is the one you want.Smallchie",1,1.972008517689554e-139,1

"When I first became interested in reef keeping and began researching it, I visited a neighbor who had recently spent a lot of money setting up his first tank. I asked if there were any books he could recommend. He had purchased several but said that the information in them all was rather dated. He suggested instead that the internet was a better source for more recent and up-to-date information. And while I've since decided that the internet is also a big source of ""myth-information"" on the hobby, I'd have to agree that many of the books I've seen are seriously out-dated.In a hobby where instant sharing of information has led to great improvements and advances recently, ""Aquarium Corals"" by Eric Borneman has perhaps been out long enough (since 2001) to have already become out-dated. But instead, this book is so well written and researched that it's still the most comprehensive and helpful guide. Borneman gives pretty much everything known regarding corals and how to keep them, whether common or uncommon in aquaria, and the information is laid out in such a way that it helps the reader to understand the different aspects and theories of coral husbandry. Plus he clarifies some of the taxonomic confusion as much as possible in an area where science still has a lot of research to do, and provides tons of excellent photos. But not only is this a great encyclopedia of species information, it also covers poorly-understood basics such as water chemistry and flow, lighting, feeding, reproduction, pests, conservation, etc., and all without being out-of-date.I imagine that advancing knowledge and methods may eventually require an updated second edition, but this book is so good that I expect it may take a while.",1,3.9180781251388574e-35,1

"I've had personal experience with Bibles from numerous American publishers, and can attest to the fact that there is nothing AMG, Holman, Nelson, Zondervan, or Tyndale can put out to equal the worksmanship of this edition. Those mass-produced editions are made out of inferior materials, slapped together with glue that breaks down after exposure to moisture, and more often than not are impossible to read from any distance. The only American Bible I've seen that compares to this is the Thompson as published by B.B. Kirkbride. The Thompson is great, mind you, but it has two big problems. First, it's expensive (though I don't think one should skimp on a Bible, especially if you're going to be reading it as much as you should be) and second, it's very big and clumsy. After my second Nelson Compact Reference Bible fell apart (I received the second as a gift- I'd never have bought another) I was in the market for a new travel-size one. It had to be lightweight and relatively small, and it had to have a concordance since I can't remember numbers to save my life.Fortunately, I stumbled by this Cambridge University Press edition. Being a conservative Christian, I don't believe in luck, so it must have been God's guidance. This is the perfect travel edition for me- it measures 7.25x5.25x1.25 inches (Amazon's dimensions apparently include the box), is barely heavier than my doomed Nelson despite being significantly larger, and has an excellent concordance. The typeface is easy to read even from my lap (I'm nearsighted- about 3 diopter prescription) and the binding is of superfluous quality. There's an added dictionary and a set of detailed maps as well, and center column references. Topic summaries are noted at the header of each page. Unlike many other Bibles I've seen, the pages turn easily straight out of the box, and are of exquisite quality. The printing in the concordance is significantly smaller than the rest of the Bible text, but this is forgivable. I'd rather have more references than have it perfectly legible. In all, I'm pleasantly surprised by the amount of helps in this Bible- it is much more than one would expect from an edition of this size. I still use my Thompson for desktop study, but I have a new companion when traveling and witnessing. It's clear to me now that Cambridge deserves its reputation as a producer of top-quality Bibles. Especially for its price, the Cameo Reference Edition comes highly recommended. It is now my gift of choice for loved ones.",1,1.0605104267206182e-66,1
"This book is based on a Churched Youth Survey performed in 1994 involving 3,795 youth from thirteen denominations. The eight-page survey questionnaire included 193 questions spread across four categories: Love and Sex; Marriage and Family; Faith and Religion; and Attitudes and Lifestyles. While there is no statistical weighting of the data, the results are weighted according to the responsiveness of the denomination's churches, which the authors' believe reflects a good cross-section of evangelical churches.A discussion of truth proceeds from the halls of history beginning in ""the Garden of Eden, when the serpent induced our first parents to trust their own reason instead of simply obeying God's command"" up to this present day. In the Renaissance, man (not God) became central, the Enlightenment found man's reason to be transcendent, the Industrial Revolution caused man to think of himself as self-sufficient, and Darwin's theory of evolution provided an alternative to a theistic understanding of origins. ""God was no longer `needed' to explain or understand how the world&#61630;and man&#61630;came to be."" The result is that man believes himself ""free to reach his own conclusions about right and wrong independent of God and His decrees.""Truth as God defines it in Scripture is radically different from what many define truth to be today. ""Absolute truth&#61630;that is, that which is true for all people, for all times, for all places"" is no longer consistently believed, defended, and applied in the lives of people. This book examines why this crisis exists in each of these three areas in detail.Be aware that realistic, hard-hitting anecdotes provide illustrative examples of the topics discussed. While many are fictional and some are drawn from factual personal experience, the authors' selections of these accounts are true-to-life and some readers may find them disturbing.This volume also offers chapters which deal with truth as it specifically relates to sex, honesty, family, love, justice, mercy, respect, and self-control. Truth is defined for each topic, a test for truth is given, and evidence for that truth. A full chapter is dedicated to recovering truth in the home, church, and community.In addition, data from the survey upon which this text was written are included in tables with summary statements and comprise the latter third of the book. Following is a section of additional resources for adults as well as youth. Included are listings of ministries that can also be enlisted to help.While providing specific information and instruction to parents and Christian leaders, this book is also valuable to all those who want to understand why and how biblical truth has become irrelevant to people today. For this reason, steps are given which can be taken to restore belief in absolute truth in the lives of all people of all ages in this generation.Reviewed by D. Garland",1,3.4950885210096825e-45,1

"At first I didn't expect much from this book by Jerry Vass. In his introduction he wrote ""This is a perfect book for the bathroom."" Talk about 'soft selling.'Soon you will realize that this book purely about a selling philosophy that is extremely practical. Myths, many of them, are debunked. The development of skills, not mere motivation, is the crux of this book. I especially liked the formula for establishing an effective mission statement. He discusses the various means of soft-probing, using supporting statements, and ultimately assuming the close with an oblique technical question. Every objection falls into one of seven categories which are handled differently. This is a great book. It would have been a super book had it been shorter and not so redundant at times.

"This book is one of many I have read on Wicca and I only bought it because I enjoy other books by David Rankine, such as his excellent book on Qabalah (Climbing the Tree of Life) and decided to cure my curiousity.As a non-wiccan I found this book to be far more readable and understandable than other books I have read in the past. It provides the reader with information on Wicca and the symbolism of the rituals and tools in a way that I have not seen elsewhere. It was also very refreshing to see visualisations for the different parts of the rituals as I have always felt this to be something lacking in Wicca. Maybe it has always been there, but the visualisations I have seen prior to that presented in this book has always left me wanting for clearer explanations.Although this book is being billed by some as a beginners book, it is definitely in my own opinion an advanced book in comparison with books by Cunningham, Silver Ravenwold and Kate West. It is obviously aimed at those already practising, who have already made the decision to follow this tradition and who are serious about actually wanting to understand what they are doing and why. Its not a big book, but its worth every penny.The authors' website www.avalonia.co.uk provides some extracts from this book, but sadly not the most exciting parts. All the same they should be congratulated on providing such a down to earth and as another reviewer put it straight to the point book on the subject. Their experience and understanding of the mysteries who through in the way they present their material, no need for trying to convince the reader that this is the only book, instead they seem to be saying the exact opposite - read this book to gain a deeper understanding on that which you already know and do",1,2.780840454003072e-106,1
"I've seen a lot of movies about the Three Musketeers but did not truly appreciate the story until I read the book. It's truly a classic novel with lots of swashbuckling adventure. The book is long but reading it is worth the effort. I recommend it highly.If you cannot get enough of the Three Musketeers, read For Honor: An Adventure of What Might Have Been by Kat Jaske. The feisty young heroine, Laurel, enlists their aid to save France. This lady can write! She makes the characters come to life. Wow",1,2.7657359701279105e-32,1

"As Hawking recently expressed, I have great doubt in an ultimate theory of everything. Supersymmetric (SUSY) theory, which makes string theory easier to deal with, is not necessary. Soon, hopefully with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), we will know if SUSY was so much math or not. BUT, even if we demonstrate SUSY physics, SUSY theory is really hierarchical. There will be a simplest theory consistent with observation up to the limit of our probing. Until we probe deeper, a whole host of alternative, more general SUSYs will crop up, and this process will likely continue indefinitely. Dito for string theory.HOWEVER, the use of higher dimensions in physics is already deeply fruitful. Take the use of dimensional regularization in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) for example, or the vivid connection one can see between Stokes' theorem and the divergence theorem in higher dimensions through differential forms, or the use of fibers and bundles in quantum field theories (QFTs) to name but a few cases. And higher space-time dimensions might soon become a part of our experimental world. We might show that Newton's law of gravity deviates from an inverse square law at short distances, or the LHC may show that gravitons leak out of our brane, or astrophysical data may yet reveal higher dimension.Halpern's book--which I found entertaining and easy to read--will let you in on the physics and physicists pushing higher dimensions to new heights of utility and deep insight",1,1.4467648849627429e-06,0.9999985532351151

"It is the story of a young teenage girl named Hillary who was speeding on a motorcycle with her boyfriend, Brad, when they ""crashed and burned,"" leaving Brad unharmed, but Hillary inches from death. She was rushed to a Jewish hospital, where she is slipping back and forth through consciousness, unable to contact anyone around her for the time she is in bed. When she is ""unconscious,"" she is a girl named Chana. Chana is a Jewish girl, living in the years a little before and during the war. While she is Chana, it is only Gestapo members on the streets, beating down the Jews and their pride. Eventually, they are all sent to a Jewish ghetto, where daily life consisted of a body under a 2-story building window, filth, disease, hard manual labor, families of eight to ten living in one room apartments, and more death. Then later, when the SS lines them all up yet again, she is almost deported, but when not, she escapes in the dead of night. For a time, she is able to pose as a Polish citizen, when someone she used to know rats her out as she gets on a train to be part of a Polish worker round-up, which had meant freedom. She is then imprisoned until she is sentenced to ""hard work"" for life, and is sent to Auschwitz. The real Chana survives the war. During all of this, Hillary sees what the Jews had to go through. She started out in the beginning completely hateful. She is part of a plan that locked up a Jewish boy in one of her schools lockers without food or water for a few days, and her Neo-Nazi group, the Warriors, are about to participate in a huge march. Her mother also comes into the story, and stays by her bedside as the story progresses, but Hillary's mother, we find out, is another reason she became a Neo-Nazi, as they have had no relationship during her childhood (her dad was her ""lifeline""). Then We see Hillary starting to talk (to herself as others stand around her), she reveals that she's had an empty chalky feeling ever since she was five, until Brad came into her life. It was he who influenced her to be recruited into the Warriors. Brad later comes to visit, with constant ""Heil Hitler's"" and informs her that they are going to torch the hospital, then leaves saying: ""You're a hero, Hil. Remember that. You're dying for the cause, White Power! ... Heil Hitler babe. See you in hell."" The fire turns out to fail, and the real Chana herself has just died of cancer as an old woman in the bed next to Hillary, but in was Chana who was able to supernaturally share her past with Hillary. Hillary is now changed, as this has been a very humbling experience",1,4.2313753986744436e-10,0.9999999995768625

"It's hard not eating meat, and I succumb often, usually with delicious fish dishes, always on Thanksgiving and Christmas, because I just love sitting down to a big turkey dinner with family and friends. But most of the time I try to stay away from meat, even though I quiver when I drive by a Mickey D's and smell that aroma. Yes, it's alright, I believe, to admit that you like going to McDonald's on occasion.Anyway, I'm rambling when I should be focusing my attention on this wonderful cookbook, this gem from the Moosewood Restaurant people that is chucky-jam-crammed full of tasty vegetarian fare. If you have a spouse who screams for his steak, meatballs or pork chops, try serving him up Japanise Braised Eggpland or the Moroccan Stew Moosewood Restaurant style, you'll have his mouth watering, have him begging for more.

"I hoenstly like THe Perilous Gard better each time I read it. I don't think I appreciated it enough the first time--I found the fairies so different from my Peter-Pan-ish idea of fairies. But this is a fairy tale in the best sense. NOt only is the entire story ""realistic"" (at least moreso than most fairytales), but I find the mood so captivating. Imagine a dark woods, deep in Northern England, a Medieval party on horseback, the haunting sound of a far-off voice chanting a ballad, and the sight of a mysterious and beautiful woman in a long green cloak. I love anything Medieval, and this book captures some of my favorite MEdieval topics: romance, Christianity (especially the part about the ""cold iron"" drew me in), paganism, ballads...together these create a thoroughly medieval mood. ANd the references to Tam Lin are wonderful.

"This book by the once husband of Terri Shiavo sits right next to the book written by the parents of Terri Shiavo. I am giving this book 5 stars not because I agree with it, but because you and I need to read it because we are facing a very serious threat to America today: Are we as Americans, much less earthlings, going to consider life sacred and something to treasure no matter what or are we (as Michael Shiavo shows) just going to throw life away whenever it is convenient for us to do so? I think this is important because in this issue, both for Terri and then for the issue on the greater scheme of things, you should receive both sides of the argument. And you should because this argument comes down to the very question: What is the price of life? Is life sacred or is life something that can be directed for a price? We see this daily. We see this in the abortion issue. We see this in the euthanasia issue. We see this in the stem cell issue. How are we as Americans going to, as this is still the beginning of the 21st century, view the meaning of life? We turn on the television and we see war in the Middle East. We flip through channels and are told about parents willing to use their children in their suicide bombing of airplanes. This book and the companion book by Terri's parents are specific examples as to whether or not we as a society will consider life to be sacred or not. Which side will we choose as time progresses? Will we see life as something sacred (such as we read in Terri's parent's book) or will we see life as commodity easily traded in (such as we read in Michael Shiavo's book)? I have to ask myself and I need to ask you the reader this: Can we turn off life whenever we feel like it and whenever we consider it the reasonable choice or will we as a society look upon life as something that we ourselves cannot govern, that the only one who can govern is GOD Himself. When I look at this book and then I look upon the horrors of society from abortion on demand (murdering millions of children per year in the name of convenience) to war on demand (i.e. let's have a war whenever we want to), I have to question the morality, the very tangible and intangible soul of society...and the only conclusion is what I read in Romans...that mankind, at our very heart, from man to woman, is evil, and that because of this evil that is in us, we do not recognize GOD's sovereignty over us and over our lives. Will we continue to slip away from the moral compass and believe that we can extinugish life whenever we foolishly want to or will we go back to showing that life, the very essence of us, is something that no man or woman has a right to arbitrarily take away whenever one feels like it.Read this book, you need to, then read the book by Terri's parents...then go back to the Bible and read from Genesis to Revelation. We are either as a society going to live for the LORD or we as a society will live for our own selfish desires. One way or the other we are either going to survive or crash and burn. That is our choice, that is the choice of the American society",1,1.2384425225377572e-75,1
"In his short life, Jack Cole, a hick from New Castle, Pa., managed to find himself at the center of three of the premiere cultural events of the 20th century.As a youngster just before World War II, he developed the goofy, idiosyncratic Plastic Man comic character, which remains among the most admired strips of the Golden Age of pulp, though Cole drew his last Plas in 1950.About then, too, a single panel of Cole's in another comic, True Crime, became the prime exhibit in one of the McCarthyite Congress's more ridiculous crusades, the one that said comix were sending our youth to hell. This brought the Golden Age of comix and the Linoleum Age of Congress to an end. After that, Cole -- now using a completely different medium (water color) and style -- became the signature artist of the new Playboy magazine.And not long after that, he shot himself, for reasons none of his friends could quite guess.Art Spiegelman, who brought comix to their highest peak of respectability (at least in the eyes of people who never read comix) with his ""Maus"" comix about the Holocaust, wrote a sensitive and complex appreciation of Cole and Plas in The New Yorker in 1999, and that text is reprinted here, along with a generous selection of Cole's output.This includes several adventures of Plas and his sidekick Woozy Winks, which rival Fontaine Fox's Toonerville Trolley strips, if not quite George Herriman's Krazy Kat, in wackiness; as well as Congress' favorite panel (a hypodermic needle aimed at a woman's eye) and the rest of that whole episode, ""Murder, Morphine and Me.""""Murder, Morphine and Me"" is no raunchier than the TV ads placed by the National Institutes of Mental Health (""This is your brain on drugs"") nowadays, but Cole was always before his time.Cole represented that nose-thumbing, razzberry-blowing strain of sez-who? Americanism that has just about been stamped out today, when we need it badly. If not the greatest, he was perhaps the most characteristic American limner of his generation.This collection was designed by Chip Kidd, in a sort of paper version of MTV film editing.

"This book is an excellent introduction to performance consulting. It assumes that you already have the ""tools"" and know-how to address performance needs, so the focus is on the consulting process itself. What I found especially useful were the question lists. In almost every chapter, Hale includes a list of questions you might ask your client in order to guide them and pinpoint the exact issue and identify the best solution. This is the side of consulting that is often given little attention in books and in the classroom, but is of vital importance.Another worthwhile highlight is the coverage on how to actually run a consulting business - in terms of financial considerations, record-keeping, etc. Another great book that goes into more depth on the ""running your business"" aspect is The Business of Consulting by Elaine Biech",1,1.6755847967052538e-91,1

"Fagan adds a new dimension to the failure of civilizations outside value reversals and psychological self-destruction posed by Brooks Adams, Spengler or de Tocqueville. Data from a variety of sources, not available until now, correlates with history the impacts of climate on civilization. Fagan opens with a curious personal experience - his small sailboat on treacherous Spanish waters, passed by cargo-laden hulks seemingly oblivious to nature's furry. This introduction becomes a wonderful analogy for the ""scale of our vulnerability"". As we complicate society and ""tame"" nature we also massively increase the calamity of nature's accumulating response. The Sumerian city of Ur becomes our first tour and what a tour it is. Fagan hits his stride, crystallizing his point when Sumerians are his centerpiece. Conceived around 6000 BCE as a collection of villages already employing canals for irrigation, the region suffered a monsoon shift driving Sumerians to increase organization through innovation. Hence, invention of the city by 3100 BCE. Volcanic induced climate shift eventually ran the Sumerian ship aground, as similar shifts did for others, not only starving the populous but dissolving faith in their gods, kings and way of life. But, Fagan writes, ""The intricate equation between urban population, readily accessible food supplies and the economic, political and social flexibility sufficient to roll with the climatic punches has been irrevocably altered."" ""If Ur was a small trading ship, industrial civilization is a supertanker."" And supertankers split in half now and then. The ability to simply return to farming or hunter gathering is now lost given that so many of us occupy the landscape, competing with everyone else under the same conditions. If some of us once comforted ourselves with notions of shinning up the hunting rifle, returning to nature in our tent during such a calamity - forget it. When societies - stretched to the limit - falter under climate change, stress in the psyche comes to the fore in ways never imagined, even (or especially) in abrasive group-oriented societies like ours. Tribal suspicions lie waiting for such opportunities. Making light of Postmodernists without trying to, Fagan notes the same human response by cultures separated by thousands of years, different continents, ""meaning and value"" systems; ""In both the Old World and the New, human societies reacted to climate traumas with social and political changes that are startling in their similarities."" Universal human truths after all. ""But if we've become a supertanker among human societies, it's an oddly inattentive one. Only a tiny fraction of people on board are engaged with tending the engines. The rest are buying and selling goods among themselves, entertaining each other...

"This book is a cornucopia of photographs and text. Paul McCartney, a veteran in the entertainment business and a class act to boot is clearly happy with himself and quite comfortable on stage, doing his job. No doubt fans as well as those with a more ""moderate"" interest in Paul McCartney as well as the Beatles will be delighted with this book. I love it!Paul McCartney is not only an extraordinary showman, but serious and dedicated to his musical Muse. He is a musical purist in the truest sense of the term in that he respects the art of being able to create and perform musically. He paints musical murals with his words; he has a full range ability in performing many different musical styles which makes him musically versatile. I like the feeling of cooperation that appears to underscore the people directly involved with this show...it sounds like the entire crew had a wonderful time and enjoyed the fruits of their success in technically enabling Paul McCartney to do a spectacular show! Paul McCartney acknowledges this which speaks highly of him. He also accepts the outpouring of love from his audience with grace and aplomb, never losing his humorous approach.To this book's credit, Paul is not put up on a staged pedastal and fawned and spoonfed obsequious flattery. The people who were directly involved in the production and execution of the concert were serious about doing their jobs well and that was reflected in the actual performance. They were doing their jobs and not currying favor from anybody. It is only natural to be enthusiastic at such a performance and no doubt making any contribution toward the show could only prompt enthusiastic delight. The photographs are delightful - readers see Paul having fun on and off stage; his lovely wife Heather and the crew who made it all possible. The book speaks to professionalism on the part of the crew; the performers and those photographing and writing about the concert. This book is truly beautiful and there are many funny, touching, endearing and serious parts. It is Gestaltism - the whole IS greater than the sum of its parts because it is the whole, that is the performer, the crew, loved ones, audience and all who had a part in the production who made the whole show/experience/book as wonderful as they are. It is a glimpse behind the performer's curtain.",1,6.996839704988878e-137,1

"Every American should know the story of Rosa Parks and all the people who helped dismantle Jim Crow and raise the dignity of all Americans. This is a fascinating and enlightening book that would serve well to be a part of every American's library. Despite its modest size it packs plenty of details most likely not part of the familar Rosa Parks lore. For instance, the bus driver James Blake had previously had a run in with her 12 years earlier and had since become a person she avoided. Also she had attended non violence resistance workshops at a School in Tennesee before her arrest. That her father had left when she was a child and that her husband was a barber who later had a drinking problem. These details give us insight to the human being Rosa Parks was and is today.

"Kern's easy-to-read, educated analysis allows us to relive the stories while seeing how they build confidence and self-understanding through Harry's choices, based on values rather than outside pressure. 50-some years old, left brained and typically interested in non-fiction, I started reading the Harry Potter books because I admired so that they made kids interested in reading. I believe reading is the key to a child's futures and I wanted to understand the motivation these books were giving young people. So far, I've loved 5 of the Potter books and the 6th one is on order. I also gave the Potter fever to my 74-year-old Dad and brother, a tough 34-year-old in prison who read and then passed them around to other inmates! He said, ""Now I see why Mom loved to read.""

"This book is quite easily the best text I have seen in breaking down cardiology into easy to comprehend and absorb topics. As a cardiovascular technician, I have used this book on numerous occasions to either better understand a patient's pathological condition or to help me prepare lectures and classes. I feel it does an excellent job of compiling the necessary knowledge, while making it very readible. Other cardiology standards, such as Branwauld's and Hurst's may cover some topics better, but Lilly and Co. do a great job at summarizing each subject. My personnal favorites in this book are the chapters on murmurs and heart sounds, congenital heart defects, and cardiovascular pharmacology (the best review on this potentially mind-boggling topic I have seen).

"This is an entertaining and informative biography on the development and continual reworking and modifying of the Theory of Evolution as put down by Charles Darwin, and other tidbits of information regarding Darwin's personal life and habits and behaviors. The author, David Quammen, also touches on the work of Alfred Russel Wallace and his parallel development of his own Theory of Evolution. Other aquaintances of Darwin, many of them prominent men of science, are also mentioned and elaborated on. Quammen is a very capable and talented story teller who brings a wry sense of humor and keen insight to a subject that could very easily spiral into a morass of boredom in less capable hands. Charles Darwin is brought to life as not only an assiduous workaholic prober of the natural world, but as the very human, gentle, and compassionate husband and father that he was. My only complaint is that this wonderful little nugget is too short. I would have preferred a volume twice as long but no longer. And Quammen also comments on the book's brevity. I recommend this work. It is not as thorough as Quammen's ""Song of the Dodo,"" but it is a good read and can be knocked off in an afternoon; plus you may learn things you may not have known about one of the great scientific theorists of the nineteenth century. One final note: there is a funny bit regarding the human genome vis a vis that of the mouse that made me laugh out loud for several minutes. Who knew that science could be so funny.

"This a very good book that gives much information on the Holiness and Pentecostal traditions. It does very good to talk also about the Charismatic movmenent in various churches. It is interesting how it documents the different approaches to sanctification and baptism with the Holy Spirit, and how these two works are experienced or dependent on one another. This did create division among early Pentecostals. However, I think all of today's Pentecostal believers will emphasize the need for holiness and sanctification through the Word, the blood of Christ, and the Holy Ghost.

"John Leslie may be familiar to readers either through his own work or through J.L Mackie's _The Miracle of Theism_. In the latter, Mackie presented Leslie's 'axiarchism' (essentially, the view that the cosmos exists because it's good that it do so) as a plausible alternative to traditional theism (though an alternative that Mackie himself rejected because he disbelieved in the objectivity of 'value' anyway).In fact it's not really an 'alternative' to theism; more correctly, it's one possible philosophical understanding _of_ traditional theism, a point Leslie acknowledges here.In this lucidly written and well-argued volume, Leslie presents his more or less neoplatonic/Spinozistic outlook in accessible terms (updating the version he expounded in _Value and Existence_) and replies to various objections to its plausibility.His theory can be summarized in two major theses. (a) Everything we mean by 'the universe' simply _is_ the thought of a divine mind. Every object in the universe is either an object of divine thought, or (in the case of conscious beings like ourselves) a portion or subsystem of the divine mind itself. (This 'or' is not exclusive; you and I may well be both such objects and such subsystems.) (b) This divine mind (or perhaps an infinite number of such minds) exists because it's _good_ that it should do so -- i.e., that there should be a mind that, in some relevant sense, 'knows everything worth knowing'. Its existence is one case in which a fundamental sort of 'ethical requiredness' has the power to bring the 'required' state of affairs into being.For some reason these two theses don't seem as intuitively plausible to everyone as they do to me. So Leslie raises and meets objection after objection in an effort to show how plausible they really are. (Some of the objections are based on recherche topics in set theory, quantum physics, and other such fields, so readers without much philosophical sophistication should be prepared to work a bit. But Leslie's explanations are both clear and self-contained.)Of course he doesn't remove all controversy (and doesn't claim to; he puts even the strength of his own belief in (b) at better than 50% but far short of certainty). But he does meet quite a lot of nontrivial objections. (And of course he's right that very few questions of philosophical interest have answers that are 'provable' in any strong sense anyway.)Strictly speaking, one could accept one of his theses but not the other. But Leslie also shows how they're related to each other -- i.e., why the creative-power-of-value argument makes better sense on a pantheistic cosmology and vice versa. (A crucial claim here -- and one that Leslie supports at length -- is the claim that only minds and 'mental stuff' could have a certain requisite sort of unity.)I won't try to summarize his arguments here; I'll just recommend them to readers who can profit from clear and nuanced philosophical exposition. I think both theses are sound -- and although I was already a panentheist/panpsychist before I read this book, Leslie has given me a lot of additional food for thought. (By the way, Leslie refers to his own theory not as 'panentheism' but as 'pantheism'. I hope we never meet, or we'll have a very boring argument.)If you like it, you might also check out Timothy Sprigge's _The Vindication of Absolute Idealism_, which is the one that sold me",1,9.113174342887755e-110,1
"Hell's Angels is an all-time enduring classic by the late ""Gonzo"" journalist Hunter S. Thompson. It is a very interactive, very detailed description of one's affiliation with the dreaded motorcycle outlaws known as the Hell's Angels. The writing style is quite fascinating, for if it were not based on actual accounts or the interpretations thereof, it would be a most fascinating series of pulp fiction stories.The group, Hell's Angels, is described as a group of unhygienic individuals who have no particular goals in life and who know that the roads they travel will lead to no success. They are highlighted as those who know that they are in financial and social oblivion and that their situations are only going to get worse. They are characterized, with the exception of a rare few, as uneducated bums with no purpose in the long run and who choose to live for the moment by going to bars, drinking heavily, engaging in unspeakable sexual acts, and torturing those who ""get in their way"" psychologically, physically and sexually.An intermittent account of how the Hell's Angels, especially the lower-ranking members, are portrayed is laden with paradoxes. Comparisons are drawn between their physical attributes and those of the bikes they ride. On the one hand, the Angels are the sloppiest individuals of the worst kind, yet their bikes are lovely, well-maintenanced machines of thoroughly polished chrome and steel. In one recollection, Thompson mentioned that when off their bikes, they appeared as clueless, spastic, inane and inarticulate dolts, but when they got on their bikes, they became transformed into something quite the opposite, which entitled them to being Kings of the Road. For the clumsiness on foot would be more than compensated for by masterful uses of their motorcycles, including an indescribable ability to skillfully and gracefully go around highly dangerous curves at 120 mph. It is at that point that the reader comes to realize that if he/she were on a California highway in the mid-1960's, especially any of those near Oakland or Berdoo, no one messes with the Angels.The paragraphs above shed light on the Angels in very notorious ways, and rightfully so. Indeed, the Angels could be quite a perplexing group. Despite the nihilistic tendencies of its several members, the Angels consisted of chapters throughout California and various parts all over the U.S. For these multi-faceted groups to be formed and maintained, the presidents had to be highly systematic, highly organized individuals. Hunter Thompson mentioned the Grand Poo-Bah of these chapters, namely Sonny Barger, who primarily ran the Oakland chapter and was a very astute and intelligent individual much attuned to the activities of and policies enacted in California law so as to know that, in order to reduce, if not eradicate, dealings with police and patrolmen, there was a time and place for Angels' ""activities"" as well as that for ""no Angels around"".Even included are unusual accounts where owners whose stores were along highways the Angels would frequent would be intimidated by the Angels and relinquish their businesses to the bikers for a few hours, only to return and find that nothing was stolen and that the shops were in even better shape than they were before the Angels arrived. Not only did Thompson record accounts that some of the Angels could be good storekeepers for the moment, he also made note that after some of their excursions, they would actually leave behind money on the counter for purchases of beer.Psychologically complex and dysfunctional, yet functional, could the Angels have ever been during Thompson's adventures with them. Thompson acknowledged that the Angels were to be regarded as hippies but not in the fashion attributed to the anti-Vietnam War demonstrators. In fact, Thompson mentioned that by-and-large the Angels did not like this latter bunch. Interestingly enough, Thompson pointed out that the groups were physically similar but were ideologically dissimilar; what was the present (the mid-1960's) was the only tie that would bind these groups. To sum it up, Thompson would cite the peace demonstrators as those who turned against the values instilled by previous generations and were ""rebelling against the past"", while the Angels, without the education and marketable skills to thrive in a developing, technologically-driven U.S. market, were ""rebelling against the future"".All in all, Thompson had his share of interesting experiences. I will not get into the juicy details, but one might as well receive the message that if you were to deal with people like the 1960's Hell's Angels and wanted to survive, you might as well put philosophical themes of ethics on hold, unless if they are equipped with the rationality needed for self-preservation. I conclude with portions of a paragraph regarding the nature of the Hell's Angels: ""Despite everything psychiatrists and Freudian castrators have to say about the Angels, they are tough, mean and potentially dangerous as packs of wild boar. The moment a fight begins, any leather fetishes or inadequacy feelings are entirely beside the point, as anyone who has ever tangled with them will sadly testify...[Y]our chances of emerging unmaimed depends on the number of heavy handed allies you can muster in the time it takes to smash a beer bottle.

"Change is no news. The great changes that will alter the commercial, political and demographic workings of the world are already underway and some of their consequences are quite predictable, says author Peter Schwartz. He outlines a variety of the more important changes, particularly in places such as China and India, and limns scenarios that represent possible futures. Perhaps this sort of book is inevitable at the turning of a century, of a millennium. The author, in fact, compares his work to predecessors at the end of the nineteenth century. Although some of his predictions fall far short of shocking - for example, global warming and aging populations are hardly undiscovered issues - the exercise of thinking about scenarios and preparing strategies is a good one. The book is also entertaining, because Schwartz writes with a light hand and a casual style. We believe this book would be a good airplane read. It would certainly be appropriate for a long flight, since air travel contributes to some of the more important changes the author discusses.

So you know they will provide excellent recipes. I have always had a hard time creating salad dressings, and original salads. Guess what? This book does it will ease. This book is well organized, and easy to read. I love all of the extra tips and extra material that they add to the book. I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I have",1,2.407827531879929e-68,1
"It's about time someone authored a good history of the Army of the Tennessee. We have had our share of histories of the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia.

As one disappointed person stated, its a glossary. Its supposed to be one. If you'r expecting anything else, then of course you aren't going to like it.If you're trying to find a certain page or scene, or you missed something and you are confused, then this book will help you out.

"I have had Leuci as a college professor, and after reading this book I can again remember his class lectures. The reality in his writing is sometime scary. This book is not just a cop story, it releases the truths behind police corruption. This book is the perfect compliment to &quot;The Prince of the City&quot; Finally, the book is written first hand by the person that went through it all. Highly Recommended!",1,2.4690100846520204e-35,1
"This book is written in the form of a diary--which if it is not done correctly, can be extremely boring. This is simply not the case with this book!! It was riveting throughout. I read the book in only 2 days and could not put it down. The book follows the life of Marie from her teen years until her death, written as she might have felt. The well-developed characters and fast plot made it a read for well into the night...I do not normally read this type of literature, but was in a bookstore and the cover caught my eye. I started reading it and I was immediately hooked. This book held my interest and complete attention from the first page to the last. In fact, I found myself re-reading parts of it that I thought were written extremely well. I don't think many of the people who have written reviews have given this book enough credit where it is due. Erickson was not writing a history book to be taken literally, though much of this book really had historical value. I felt that the image painted of Marie Antoinette was very well done. While some people have criticized the book because it softens the image of Marie, I actually enjoyed the alternate perspective. Erickson has often been adament in her non-fiction that Marie had only one extra-marital lover, which this book portrays. The book is, in fact, written as a diary and therefore through the imaginary eyes of Marie Antoinette. It is simply how she might have viewed/felt about aspects during her lifetime. The book was very well written, and did contain romantic sentiment--but I did not find it over-bearing or tacky. In fact, it only added to an extremely dramatic plot. This is one of the best books I have read in a long time and I am glad that I took a chance at reading it. I recommend this book whole-heartedly.",1,1.0942555376909145e-35,1
"An outstanding look at modern international crime. Robinson has all the details and facts but puts them together in a compelling fashion that makes this book as much a page-turner as any crime novel.

I highly recommend this book, especially if you want to know why the ""war on drugs"" is failing miserably",1,1.755400441143302e-189,1

"About a year ago, I began the Dean Ornish diet (low- to no-fat grains, beans, fruits, veggies ONLY). I needed to lose about 20 pounds, and even on a 1,500-calorie Weight Watchers Food Pyramid ""balanced"" diet and running several days a week, the weight just wasn't coming off. The Ornish ""vegan"" plan was a disaster. There was no noticeable weight loss and in fact I began gaining weight. This plan is about 80% carbs. The fact that these were ""healthy"" high-fiber carbs didn't seem to make a difference to my body. I was just not losing weight. Throughout the past year I started gaining more weight because I began binge-eating, even if it was ""healthy"" stuff like fruit, vegetarian soups, and grains. But my sugar cravings continued. They never went away, like Ornish says they will. All of this high fiber is supposed to ""regulate"" our blood sugar somehow. I don't buy it. It didn't work for me. But I stuck with it because I had been brainwashed to believe that a high-fiber high-carb natural foods diet was healthiest. But ingesting so many carbs keeps you in a cycle of binge-eating and wanting more and more food. It's like you just can't get satisfied. You don't get satiated, your body is always looking for more. I gained 13 pounds on Ornish over the last year. This was in addition to continuing to run 3 miles 3-4 times a week. I was not only not losing weight on Ornish, I was up 13 MORE pounds from my original 20 excess pounds.Two weeks ago, I started the Atkins diet. After all of my ""vegan"" brainwashing, it was difficult for me to even think about ingesting so many animal products, but I was now 13 pounds heavier than when I began Ornish a year ago. So I bought the book and started Induction, adhering strictly to the guidelines. I have dropped 9 pounds in the last two weeks. I don't know if this is all water weight - I have about 30-35 pounds to lose. Frankly, I don't care if it's all water weight - it's 9 pounds off my body, just gone. In two weeks. It's miraculous. I couldn't lose 9 pounds in a year on Ornish's plan. Not in a year. The best part of Atkins is how it cuts cravings. My body must not do well with lots of carbs, even the ""healthy"" high-fiber carbs, because I binge-ate on Ornish, even though it was ""healthy."" My cravings are gone. I just don't want to eat any junk. I'm not thinking about food all day. I eat until I feel satisfied, and I stop. I'm not looking for food an hour later, not foraging around, becoming obsessed with sweets or snacking an hour later. It's amazing. This is one of the most ""freeing"" aspects of the plan, the feeling of being in control of your eating. On Weight Watchers and on Ornish, I was constantly thinking about food.I bought into the ""vegan"" health food hype about high-fiber carbohydrates. It doesn't work. Perhaps it works for some. But many of us are just too carb-sensitive. It is difficult to adhere to and causes binge-eating even though it is high in fiber. I no longer believe the high-fiber ""hype"" brought to us by the grain and cereal industry. It's a crock. We don't need 40-50 grams of fiber every day packaged in a carbohydrate that sends our blood sugar through the roof and sets us up for weight loss failure. We don't need it. For an interesting follow-up interview with Gary Taubes from 12/03 (since his NYT article from 7/02), Google ""frontline interview gary taubes."" He talks about how we've all been hookwinked by the AMA, the FDA, and the powers-that-be with respect to our low-fat diets. People, we've been taken for a ride by the food industry and the medical establishment for the last 20-25 years with this low-fat myth, and it's killing us. It's been a long-running experiment on the American populace, and we're dying and killing ourselves because of it. Get off the low-fat bandwagon, folks. Your blood sugar will thank you, your body will thank you, and you will be more in control of your eating than ever.",1,2.531824051067951e-07,0.999999746817595

He was raised in a home of all boys with rather Godless and unstable parents. While I was raised in a strong Christian home, I think my upbringing would have been so much richer and less heart-wrenching had this book been around 38 years ago...

"I Know An Old Lady Who Swallowed A Pie is one of the best find for the Thanksgiving holiday. This is an adapation of the old classic rhyme, I Know An Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly, with a Thanksgiving twist. She eats and eats until she blows up like a balloon, and flies in the Thanksgiving parade. It's hysterical, and little ones love it. The cadence is wonderful, and a blast to read aloud!

If you're looking for a hilarious book for young children say 3 to 7 then this may fit the bill.",1,1.8920526119264993e-122,1
"This is a book likely to be stolen from your coffee table for its delicious romp through the back rooms of history. It's full of bawdy stories and poetry about history's most notorious figures written (mostly) during their lifetimes. You will laugh out loud at the verse about Julius Caesar's promiscuity and the size of King Charles II's ""royal sceptre"", the humorous epigrams of the great Roman satirists, the wit of Mark Twain, and the sexual superstitions of the past. It more than fills the void left by PLAYBOY when it ended the Classic Ribaldry section years ago because many of the entries are about real people whose names you've heard in history lessons since you were a child. My only complaint about this book is that it isn't longer with even more stories about Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson, and everyone else who seems larger than life. This book adds to their humanity.",1,1.4783084015856572e-175,1
"I recently cameto Southern Iowa and was struggling for what to plant in the Midwestern garden that had been left in a sad state of ruin by the former occupants.

I got the book last fall as a gift and followed all the suggestions. Now that spring is coming, my beautiful daffodils, crocus and other flowers are peeping up to be followed by the other flowers recommended.

"This is the Volume 6 of the famous Course of Theoretical Physics by L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz. All serious students of theoretical physics must possess the ten volumes of this excellent Course, which cover in detail and rigour practically all the branches of theoretical physics. The Volume 6 treats the theory of the motion of liquids and gases. The book opens with the theory of ideal fluids and drives the attention of the reader to a large amount of topics, which are discussed in greater detail and, moreover, discussing with details topics not usually found in other similar books, such as turbulence, sound, fluid dynamics of combustion, relativistic fluid dynamics and the dynamics of superfluids. The book is written in a language proper of a theoretical physicist, but owing to its clarity, it can be read without problems for other scientists. A superb book",1,3.2350726521143893e-119,1
"Several recent and outstanding books have each examined in detail a single address by Abraham Lincoln. These books have the overall goal of explaining Lincoln's Presidency, the meaning and significance of the Civil War, and the continued impact of the issues raised in this conflict upon today's United States. These books include Gary Wills's study of the Gettysburg Address, the books by John Corry and Harold Holzer on Lincoln's Cooper Union speech, Allen Guelzo's study of the Emancipation Proclmation, and, the book I will discuss here, ""Lincoln's Greatest Speech: The Second Inaugural"" (2002) by Ronald C. White, Jr.Ronald White is a professor of American Religous History at the San Francisco Theological Seminary. Given his background as a scholar of religion, it is unsurprising that Professor White focuses on President Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address and on the religious vision he finds Lincoln set forth in that great speech.The book begins with a chapter setting the stage on the cold and rainy March 4, 1865, in Washington D.C. when Lincoln delivered his brief 703-word address. Union arms were close to victory, and the large audience undoubtedly expected a paean to the might of the Union Army together with tones of triumph.President Lincoln delivered a speech entirely different. In short compass, he delivered a meditiation on the origin of the War, its cost in human life, its origin in the institution of slavery, a call to forbearance and charity, and, most importantly for Professor White, a religious understanding of the meaning of the War.Professor White explores the speech on a paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line basis. He discusses closely the words of Lincoln's text, and he places the text in context of events in the War and of mid-19th Century America. He offers illuminating insights on the Second Inaugural by discussing a short letter Lincoln wrote on April 4, 1864, to the Governor of Kentucky in which Lincoln explained his reasons for issuing the Emancipation Proclmation. He also relies heavily on a short passage of jottings Lincoln prepared for himself in September, 1862, captioned ""Meditation on the Divine Will.""The Second Inaugural as Professor White expounds it sets forth a complex religous message. The War, as Professor White reads Lincoln, was the will of a living and ethical God and was a recompense for the sin of slavery. This sin was nation-wide in scope and could not be imputed only to the rebelling Confederates. During the course of the conflict, Lincoln had moved from the agnosticism and determinism of his youth to a concept of a personal God. His God was nondenominational and nontribal rather that the God of any particular creed (Lincoln never joined a church) or of factions, including the North or the South. The scourge of slavery had brought on the War, but the end of the War opened the opportunity for forgiveness, reconciliation, and justice, ""with malice toward none,with charity for all; with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right.""It is an impressive and theologically-complex vision. Professor White writes with a purpose of encouraging meditation among his readers on the role of religion (not denominationalism) in our public life and on the continuing sruggle in our country to eliminate the vestiges of slavery and racism. He writes (p. 202):""The Lincoln that is available to us comes with no simple answers. The chasm of race, which undergirded the legal structure of slavery, continues even though the Civil Rights movement, a hundred years after the Civil War, spearheaded political and legal action intended to right ancient wrongs. Martin Luther King, Jr. chose to speak with the imposing statue of Lincoln as the background when he offered his dream for America.""Those readers interested in exploring further the complicated question of Lincoln's philosophical and religous beliefs may wish to read Allen Guelzo's biography ""Redeemer President"" together with his more recent study of the Emancipation Proclamation.",1,9.013713806610424e-07,0.9999990986286194
"This book is waaaay to detailed. If you want to know all kinds of facts that really have nothing to do with the battle, like what every politician was thinking, what every correspondent was reporting and all kinds of other side facts, this book is for you. It begins with no real history or set up and concentrates on the embassy in Ho Chi Mihn City like that's the center of it. No way. I enjoy history, but why does almost every historical book I read have to be an epic bogged down by minutia. Give me a really strong overview with only the essential facts, and if I want to know every detail I will pursue further books.

"I agree with the other reviews here that this novel was poorly written and edited. It was difficult reading because there were so many typos and some sentences didn't make sense. These mistakes distracted from the book, and neither the writing nor the plot were enough to make up for it. That being said, the main character is likeable, but the novel was a struggle to finish. A lot of ground that has been (better) covered by (many) other authors. I hate to write a bad review, but I cannot recommend this book, it was a disappointment!",1,4.7691216981831096e-67,1
"If you want a starting place in your search to find REAL Soul music, look no further than this book. Guralnick points you in the right direction. It is very clear that he loves the subject matter. He investigated the legends, and reports as much truth as will come to light, about performers like Otis Redding, Solomon Burke, James Brown, Sam Cooke, Arthur Alexander, Aretha Franklin, James Carr, O.V. Wright, Al Green, Wilson Pickett, and many others. There is also a history of Stax Records that Rob Bowman used as a reference for his epic history of the label. And there's a comprehensive discography, which has been updated for the CD era. Guralnick let the story take him wherever it led, even if he didn't always like the conclusions.

Definitely better than Lonesome Dove, because in this book stuff actually happens unlike L.D. where it takes 200 pages just to get their arses off the porch.

"I wonder if I should be even thinking of reviewing this book, given that I have had the very good fortune of being friends with the author for over 20 years now -- we met before ""Beans"" was published.However, I also feel that somebody out there should understand that this is a wonderful, honest, painful, loving, remarkable book. Carolyn writes about things she knows, and then gets very up close and personal about it.This book is an attempt to show those who have never known [or even seen] the lives of people some would term ""unfortunate"" and others simply disdain, and to show that THESE PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. Being poor does not mean that one cannot live with dignity, or honesty, or humor. Being poor does mean that these people are often forced to live in a society that demeans them, insults them, and often forces them into places where they are regarded as nothing but yesterday's garbage.Let there be no mistake; The Beans are with us, and are not about to go away anytime soon, nor should they. If we have eyes to read and lips to read aloud the story of The Beans, we just might realize that they have much to teach us about truth, honor, respect, and love.I understand that many people will not understand how on earth I can make this statement because I understand that many people prefer to look for the tawdry and speciousness in environments that they find uncomfortable or even unbelievable.But this is above all a book of hope. It shows us that everyone lives a life of worth and influence, even if at times some of these ""everyones"" live lives that are in large part cruel and uncaring. And in that is the challenge of this book; to look below the surface and to see that all of us are part of the Bean family, and that we should value that relationship.This book is an amazing literary achievement, and this is a statement that I never make lightly -- even if the author happens to be a friend. So read it and try to let its power and honesty confer those qualities in abundance in your lives. You may not find them in your first reading of the book, but trust me -- they're there.",1,2.6155398404743717e-138,1
"I bought the audio version (7 CDs), in part because it was read by Barret Whitener, who did an excellent job with the voices for The Confederacy of Dunces. I Googled his name and was glad he did the reading for The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History. Though not nearly as entertaining as ""Confederacy of Dunces"", the ""Guide"" was very informative. What we learend in public schools was often ""sugar coated"". Lets face it, busing and welfare were total failures. Two past presidents (both Democrats) were elected on far more suspicious circumstances than President Bush. The Soviet Union wasn't always our enemy: which led to the shameless betrayal of Russian soldiers that defected. Even President Lincoln had racist tendencies. ""Slaughter"" of the Indians was the exception, and by no means the norm. I'm sure they wouldn't, but I'd like my liberal friends to listen to at least the last two CDs in the set, that cover events since WWII.

"""How to Write a Damn Good Novel, Vol. II"" earns its claim as ""Advanced Techniques for Dramatic Storytelling"" with uncommon advice such as how to create a multi-premise novel and strengthening the narrative voice. Frey far exceeds the typical hints found in most writing books, including his own Volume One. This book covers completely new territory and will be extremely useful if you are interested in writing a dramatic novel. I can think of several best-selling authors who would benefit from the advice in this book. For the newcomer there is a lot of clear and practical information offered. I found the ""Seven Deadly Mistakes"" chapter particularly interesting and insightful. One warning: this book is definitely geared to a specific type of story - the dramatic novel. It may skew your focus if your goal is writing a satirical or allegorical story, for instance, as it's easy to become caught up in the author's enthusiasm for dramatic fiction",1,2.664075064297925e-46,1

"This review refers to the audio CD version of this book. From the very beginning, I found Allison's writing and voice to be very compelling. I was very impressed with this book. I have learned many life lessons from this book. To cherish the people and loved ones who are in your life and to let it show. Allison has also answered many questions I've had about the other side and has helped me to embrace my own psychic abilities. I liked hearing her stories about her numerous readings and details from the hit TV show Medium. A great book for all those interested in Allison's work and learning new things. Highly reccommended. The best thing I like about this book was Allison's clear writing style. She doesn't try to impress you with big words, which in my opinion, makes this book easy to understand and most enjoyable to read. You won't be dis appointed!

"This is my first book by Wilson and I am very impressed. He is one of those few thriller writers who relies on good old fashioned WRITING. No cheap tricks, no serendipitous coincidences, no whiz-bang save-the-world with only seconds to go. No, Robert Wilson takes his time, develops his characters, unravels his complicated plot, leavens each page with great wordsmithing and, in so doing, presents the reader with a treasure. This book, however, is not perfect. There are so many characters that he thoughtfully provides a cast of characters at the end of the book. And the pacing of the novel bogs down right at the outset, but like a big train engine, the novel rolls down the tracks, gaining momentum that, by the end of the book, seems unstoppable. I liked this book because it was a good read and it didn't insult my intelligence",1,1.1605528017522514e-166,1
"Tom Brown is, quite frankly, a terrible writer. Had I not heard him speak live, I would have thrown this book away and written Tom off as a half-educated moron who thinks he has something intelligent to say about touchy-feely, self-centered, pseudo-spiritual mumbo-jumbo. Fortunately, personal interaction with the man tells me that he is far more intelligent than his grasp of grammatical and large structural elements of writing would indicate. His famed charisma and passion for what he teaches is sincere. His understanding of the human condition, the material and spiritual deficiencies of this culture, and the importance of re-education (as opposed to political movements, fads, etc.) are what make his message so powerful to so many people. Awakening Spirits is, as I said, not the most well-written book I've read in the last several years by far. There are only clich attempts and eloquent language, this style and structure is repetative, and there are nearly constant instances of places where another word or phrase would have been better used. Nevertheless, if the reader is willing to overlook these annoyances, as well as do some of the extra work required to understand what Tom is valiantly attempting to communicate, this book has the potential to reveal profound truths and offer a new approach to the world that is sorely needed in our day and age. The exercises are effective, and the philosophic principals can be applied to everyday life.It's unfortunate that this book doesn't have the same power as Tom Brown in the flesh. The reader misses out of the convincing charisma Tom can give to his live students, and is required to take much more on faith.

"All I wanted to do was learn html code in a short peroid of time. I did not have any prior knowlege so I was looking for a beginner book. This book is terrible. Half the chapters don't even deal with html at all. There is an entire chapter on the different colors that you should use in your site. It is as if the author is trying to give you an art class.

"I write this review for a specialized audience. As an EFM mentor of 7 years, I highly recommend this book as background and supporting reading for Years 2 and 3. It contains a wealth of information covered in these years as well as lots of additional information about many of the documents that did not make ther final cut into the New Testament. White covers his material in very clear prose and relies heavily on boxes to summarize complex material. This should be invaluable in your EFM studies. So, I recommend getting this book and using it throughout year two and in the beginning of year 3.To the general public, I do issue a caveat related to this book. This is not a book about Jesus. It is a book about the environment in which Jesus lived and about the growth of the Jesus movement through the first two centuries. It is NOT a Bible commentary, although it is a great companion for Bible study.",1,6.032144908334486e-36,1
"This is definitely a book that has helped me struggle through my teen years when I was learning how to write, and it still does help me as a college student in my creative writing courses. It is a book all aspiring young writers (and old, too) should read. It's both inspiring and helpful, offering advice on character creation to plot-building. There's even a cool chapter on writing mysteries, for all of you Arthur Conan Doyle hopefuls. So check it out. I can't say enough how much it's helped me.",1,2.261306531724097e-35,1
"Let's clear up any possible confusion from the very beginning: while The Cat Who Came for Christmas did indeed come for Christmas, this is in no way a Christmas book. That's important because this book is completely delightful, and I don't want anyone who comes across it in July to think he needs to wait five months before he can read it. Animal lovers, especially cat lovers, will find this book absolutely delightful, and those readers who are so unfortunate as to have never had the privilege of being owned by an animal will get a moving picture of the kind of human-animal bond the rest of us are always going on about. Indeed, the book closes with the suggestion that pet-less owners would do well to go down to their local animal shelter and find a faithful friend for themselves. We first meet the aforementioned cat on a snowy Christmas Eve in New York. Cleveland Amory, the founder of The Fund for Animals, helps rescue a poor feline from the streets of the city and takes him home - temporarily - to care for him until a suitable home is found. Amory is, by his own admission, a dog person, but he quickly falls in love with this poor young cat who has obviously suffered much in his young life: he is terribly thin, his body bears several wounds, his back is obviously injured, he is filthy, and he may well have never known the affection of another soul. Someone has reportedly thrown things at him and hit him in an effort to run him off, so his emergency rescue is a necessity. Underneath all of the dirt, Amory finds a beautiful white cat with magical eyes and a spirit that wins Amory over from the start. He is so beguiled by the little guy that he talks a prospective new owner out of adopting him the very next morning.The book, as it unfolds, is the story of this special cat and the human he owns over the course of their first year together. Amory describes many of the conversations he has with his lovable but stubborn new friend, expounds greatly upon matters of cat psychology that all cat lovers will immediately recognize, and basically delivers a truly heart-warming story about two curmudgeons, one human and one feline, who magically find each other and develop a deep and lasting friendship. You'll read about the cat's behavior toward new people (including the likes of celebrities such as Walter Cronkite and Cary Grant), other animals, travel, veterinarians, and basically life in general. The stories of Amory's behavioral modification techniques and feline communication skills are as insightful as they are funny and do nothing to dispel the notion that cats are very stubborn little creatures. The chapters on the cat's domestic and foreign policies are especially instructive and endearing. Amory is a wonderfully witty storyteller. Some may complain that he sometimes goes off on tangents, but these are most instructive as they invariably relate to early efforts by The Fund for Animals to protect those creatures being brutally exploited by human beings (e.g., whales and baby seals); I must say I don't approve of some of the techniques the group employs, but certainly the group's heart was in the right place. Amidst all of the cat-related humor, Amory is wont to slip in some wonderfully subtle little jokes and literary references, and I would argue one learns as much about human nature as feline nature over the course of the book. You might notice I have refrained from giving the cat's name; this is intentional on my part. A cat's name is very important, and the author devotes many pages to the naming process of this cat in particular, so I would be remiss to simply blurt the name out here",1,8.662532087280449e-134,1
"It's not too much to infer that the author's main concern in writing this book was to be the first person to deliver a Java image processing book (1999), since he says as much in one of the many radically uninspired (and frequently self-generated) ""pithy"" quotes that precede each chapter. Every bad thing the other readers have said about this book is true- here's my contribution. Throughout the book, he references advanced mathematical concepts as though the expected reader was a graduate mathematics major. Nevertheless, when the concepts get easy enough to cover comprehensibly without too much effort, he explains them in detail. So, for instance, he goes into what a histogram is, what the formula for finding the roots of a binomial equation is (which we all learned in 11th grade ) etc. etc. Compare this to his explanations of the higher mathemtical concepts upon which his code depends which seem to be penned in order to win some contest for expository opaqueness. Basically, if you can understand his fragmented, confusing, telegraphic and seemingly careless explanations then you already know enough so as not to need the book in the first place. But hey, it was first.",1,2.814735297551575e-35,1
"A few years ago, I read this fascinating account about the famous ""Weschester Boomerang"" sightings of the Hudson Valley and what made this so believable was that it was coming from the type of people who were highly educated and were the type of people who laugh at people who claimed to have witnessed UFO's. The first time I had ever heard about these sightings was on an Unsolved Mysteries episode. A number of people thought this was a spaceship from another world and so did I at one time. However, it wasn't until I researched the life, times, and inventions of a brilliant genius named Nikola Tesla that I realized that all UFO's are most likely secret government projects that are still using his inventions to this very day. What is incredible about Tesla is that he invented a lot of technology that we use today back in the late 1800's!! Among his inventions were remote control, lasers, X-Rays, Alternating Current, Radio, Robotics, and Wireless Communication, just to name a few. What is amazing is that he had over 700 patents and a lot of his work he had to keep secret, for fear of being stolen from other people, which is why we haven't heard much about his inventions until years later. In fact, computers were actually already being developed as early as the 1940's, using Tesla's technical know-how, and Tesla was by far not the only genius who developed items that were way ahead of their time. When one sees how much technology was actually invented over 100 years ago, then it is not hard to believe that the government around the 1980's would have a huge metallic structure that could fly silently, especially when one realizes that technology is exponential. Also, in recent years there have been a number of articles written about the government experimenting with anti-gravity technology--no, not from aliens, but from geniuses like Nikola Tesla.At any rate, this book is well-written and is surprisingly down to earth for being a UFO book and is fun reading.",1,2.448674948080624e-118,1
"A New History of India by Stanley Wolpert is a one-volume history of India. Unfortunately, it is not a very good one. It appears to be written as a textbook and has many of the faults of textbooks covering such a vast subject. I often felt I needed an expert on Indian history to fill in the gaps. While one can empathize with the tremendous task of writing a one volume history of any country, the great failing of this book is that it does not give the reader a good overall perspective on the political and socio-economic development of the country. Additionally, there are poor linkages between one era and the next as the book moves from ancient to more modern times.This history starts by providing an ecological setting and tracing the history of the Indus peoples from circa 2500 BC forward. These chapters are very short and bereft of the details one needs to understand the development of the culture, politics, and economics of the country. There is a lot more to be said about early Indian history than is provided here. Often the book jumps from one theme or era to another without adequate connections to provide an understanding of the significance of events. This is even true of the chapters on the Mughal Empire, although here the text does a slightly better job.The book is on much firmer ground when discussing modern Indian history, starting with the gradual absorption of India into the British Empire. There are fuller details and linkages between events leaving the reader with a better understanding of this era in Indian history. Nevertheless, there are still gaps in providing the reader with enough information and insight to fully appreciate India's development.As a result of these shortcomings, I cannot recommend this book to the general reader.",1,1.1257289543883158e-125,1

"It is difficult to imagine a bleaker Thomas Hardy than the bleak author of his early and middle novels, but in his final novel, JUDE THE OBSCURE Hardy plummets into a depth of pessimism so entrenched into the very fabric of this book that he reaches what for him is the nadir of his tragic vision. Critical reaction was predictably negative. Hardy was so offended by what he saw as a universal misunderstanding of his philosophy that he refused to write further fiction. He spent the remainder of his life applying his personal ethos of tragedy to his poetry.It is quite true that JUDE THE OBSCURE is rife with the overwhelming sense of despair to which the critics so objected, but they had other problems with it as well. They did not care for what they saw as the ubiquitous immorality in the relation between Jude and Arabella and between him and Sue Bridehead. Living together in sin counted for more opprobrium back then than now. Further, they felt that Hardy had taken some cheap shots at his dismal portrayal of Christminster as a cesspool of false and elitist learning. Christminster was an amalgam of Oxford and Cambridge, the very alma mater of many of the offended critics. In order for Hardy to create such an unremitting world of gloom, he had to do some serious tinkering with a style of writing that was pretty gloomy in its own right. To make the reader ""feel"" the pain of Jude on a level that reached down to bone, he had to place Jude on a level much closer to the reader than Hardy had done in the past. He accomplished this by eliminating any trace of any element that did not somehow smack of existential pain. Hardy, in his earlier novels, occasionally leavened his level of tragedy by including characters who exhibited amusing quirks. No one on a quirky level is to be found here. Hardy, as in THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE, was able to portray a brute nature that might assume some of the blame as to why certain characters met a tragic fate. Here, Hardy places the blame squarely on man and his hidebound institutions as the source of tragedy. In the caste system that was typical of late Victorian society, Hardy saw more evil in that than in brute nature. What remained then was a social triangle with Jude at the apex, Jude's peers at the left end, and a ruthless society at the right end that was determined to squash interlopers more effectively than Egdon Heath ever could. If there ever was a stacked deck against those who wished to rise above their station, Thomas Hardy provided that as an equal opportunity pulverizer.",1,2.2713637619952646e-29,1

"I really enjoyed this book - I read the liner notes for it, and it really was a great, read-it-one-sitting book. Dimple is a very believable character and you can see the reality of the world in the book. I love how they give each person's passions their own real life- like Dimple with her photography, and Karsh with his music. A lot of the description that is used is full of poetry, but without being poetry really at all - but it gives you that fluid feeling - that just really makes this a delightful read. I disagree on that one review about the way that they did the quotes... Yes, it was a little odd at first, but once you realize that the hyphens represent the dialogue- it wasn't that big of a deal. I actually liked that- because as a writer- I never realized that you could do that in a publication- think so out of the box on what's usually considered a literary rule. But even that little thing is a testament to the beauty of this book. It made me want to run out and buy a Sari, and find all the Indian people and ask them who they are, and learn from them.",1,1.198102693337962e-31,1
I found this handbook very simple and easy to understand. At the same time it covers most of the aspects of transmission engineering. I have worked in telecommunications transmission and a reference like this is very useful. Unlike many other handbooks you can read it like a normal text book.

Pinkerton coming to the rescue notwithstanding, this is much too frightening for my children. I would argue that such visuals are inappropriate for children of picture-book age, period.

"Hi, I just read the review below from the infuriated reader who said that this book talks down to children. But once I went to a talk about children's books and they discussed this book and said that Margaret Wise Brown was not doing that at all. That the intent of the book is actually to invite kids to debate and have their own opinions. She sets up these statements on purpose to provoke, and to get kids to think for themselves. She's playing with the reader because of course, how CAN you say that a daisy is important 'because it is white'? It's also yellow in the middle, and has petals, or whatever. Same with an apple. She says it's important because 'it is round' but what about because it's sweet? Or juicy? The whole joke is that she's announcing 'what's important' about something in order to invite thought and prompt argument. Her other stories reveal too much depth for her to have really been trying to control kids' minds with the 'important book.'",1,2.1549688543808973e-49,1
"Almost two decades ago, Jean Carper revolutionized my thinking about food with her well researched book, ""The Food Pharmacy,"" a fascinating treatise on the health-promoting properties of foods. Since then there have been innumerable self-appointed food gurus, most of whom struck me as primarily self-promotional and thin on scientific backing. While I do continue to consider Nina Planck's iconoclastic food theories with the proverbial grain of salt, I think she has done an enormous service for the health-conscious reader by approaching the entire topic of foods, and particularly the controversial issue of dietary fats, with a fresh and relatively unbiased eye. She has assembled an impressive body of research to support her assertions regarding grass-fed meat and dairy products, and touches on many other important topics, such as the importance of Omega-3 fatty acids to the developing fetus. New to me was the research regarding the importance of lauric acid, a key component of coconut oil, as a health-promoting fatty acid. I remain skeptical about a few of her assertions, and I also partially disagree with her largely anecdotal criticism of the vegetarian diet. However, she has opened my mind to some very new approaches to food and nutrition. Additionally, she has brought the sensual pleasure of food back into focus as an integral component of healthy eating. After reading this book, you will believe more than ever the old adage that ""You are what you eat"" -- you'll just regard what you eat in an entirely new light",1,0,1

"Michael Chekhov was considered by many to be the greatest actor of the 20th century. Famous for his ability to create fantastic, and even grotesque, characterization with immense inner life. He left audiences stunned. Many well established Actors, directors and teachers have commented on the influence the Chekhov technique has had on them. Including Stella Adler, Lee Strassberg, Sanford Meisner, Gregory Peck, Harold Clurman, Anthony Quinn, Clint Eastwood, Jack Nickolson, Anthony Hopkins, Marilyn Monroe, Yul Bryner, Elia Kazan, and the list goes on. Many of these individuals where even taught by him. Stanislavsky himself called Michael Chekhov his greatest pupil. The Chekhov Technique is founded on each actors own creative individuality. Looking beyond the limitations of using your own experiences to call forth truth. He moves into the realm of the Imagination. From psycho-physical movement based work to expressing universal ideas in emotionally truthfull behavior. This book covers it all in a free, creative and nurturing way. It covers the use of atmospheres, quality of movement, objectives (aka: actions, intentions, verbs), calling forth emotion with ease, imaginary center and imaginary body, images, behavior, psychological gesture (as applied to the overall character, individual scenes, objectives, atmospheres, and moments), radiating and receiving, working off your partner, working off the audience, working with the director, improvisation, ensemble, styles from clown to tragedy, and much more. Everything in this book is both practical and fun to apply to the art of acting. Finally to the actor is available in it's entirety. If your an actor, director or teacher, it should be required reading. If your just someone interested in what's involved in the actor's craft, this book will show you the point of view of one of the greatest actor's in history.

"Robert Graves sets about, in the voice of Claudius himself, to tell the tale of how a stammering idiot rose to the supreme rule of Rome. Written almost entirely in the first person, we're taken step by step through every fine detail of Claudius' memories of childhood, love and marriage, victory and defeat. His friends and foes all come alive to share with us their stories while they come along for the journey of a lifetime. Though this novel is a work of fiction, Robert Graves stays true to fact and follows a tight line along the true events. Like a painter he takes the black and white words of history and brilliantly colours them in so that anyone can enjoy reading this novel: the value of which is found, not only as a lens into ancient Rome after the republic collapsed into the rule of emperors, but also in the enjoyment of reading a well told story. Graves' primary source for his novel is the work of ""Suetonius: The Lives of the Twelve Caesars."" Suetonius wrote a great deal on the Caesars from Julius to Domitian, which of course includes the four mentioned in ""I, Claudius;"" Julius; Tiberious, the son of Livia; Caligula; and Claudius, our stammering protagonist. Graves was born in 1885 in London and lived 100 years. Besides ""I Claudius"" Graves is also known for his poetry; particularly his war poetry. Being of both German and English descent , Graves wrote from a rather neutral perspective regarding the great wars. He fought with the Royal Welsh Fusiliers at the battle of the Somme until he was wounded; after which The London Times, mistakenly published his obituary. Long after all of this, in 1934, ""I, Claudius"" was published. Graves wrote a sequel to the novel as well; called ""Claudius the God."" ""I, Claudius"" introduced a more palatable aspect to historical studies, and has been so successful that it has been adapted into a BBC mini series and was to be made into a film, which despite having never come to fruition is a testament to how dynamic and true to life the novel is. This palatable aspect of `historical writing' offers readers a chance for a more relevant view of Roman life. Not unlike a play which, though written down, was always intended to unfold before an audience. The book is well worth reading, and well worth buying. I procured my copy for 50 cents at the public library book sale, but it's worth buying new and is a staple to any reference collection of the early Roman Empire",1,1.2243078569356945e-117,1

"It is a sore spot among many of my Voyager friends and I that I am not a Christie Golden fan. However, compared to Karen Haber, I would be urged to declare Christie Golden the goddess of all Voyager books. In reading a Voyager book I generally only find one or two errors in character traits, terminology, ship logistics, etc. ""Bless the Beast"" is full of glaring mistakes. After finding five mistakes in the first chapter, I took the initiative to earmark every page with a mistake. There were 79 pages with errors on them, several of them with more than one! That is quite a feat in a book with only 274 pages. Some were small errors such as the over abundance of curse words. Four letter words are used more in this book than probably in all of the seven seasons of Voyager. Others were glaring mistakes such as Janeway spinning her command chair on the bridge around to face the turbolift. I don't feel the need to explain this one since if you've ever seen an episode of Voyager you'd realise the imposibility of that. I also found it highly annoying that Janeway would ""give the bridge"" to Chakotay when she left her ready room. Clearly if she was in her ready room, Chakotay already had command of the bridge. Ofcourse the best instance of this was when she actually ""gave the bridge"" to Tuvok when Chakotay was on the bridge. I wonder how the first officer felt about that? The author also failed to realize that Janeway's ready room and the briefing room were two seperate areas. As such, throughout the story, Janeway has a huge conference table in her ready room. I am interested in how this was missed. Janeway is constantly asking someone else to do everything for her. Anyone familiar with Janeway knows that she is a hands on captain and this would never fly. And at one point she participates in an act so cruel and completely out of character that I was shocked. Normally I would say that I am simply being too cruel on the author due to my intense like of Janeway, however, that is not true in this instance. If you are looking to read the worst Voyager book ever written, this is the one for you? Otherwise, I'd avoid it like the plague",1,2.468501638729601e-150,1
"Before anything else is said, it should be known that this edition is a prose translation, which does not retain most poetic characteristics of the original poem although for a modern English reader this is probably the best edition yet: fairly clear and still interesting in its own way. Orlando Furioso is a 16th century epic poem dealing with Charlamgne's wars against the &quot;Saracens&quot; who had (if we are to take the poem as historical fact) even reached the point of besieging the city of Paris. Of course,the book was not meant by its author to be historically accurate in any way, merely a parody of chivalric court legends as the book description says. Whoever reads this book and fails to sense irony on every page, even crude jokes in some parts clearly does not understand what he is reading in the least. But Orlando Furioso is not a parody of just chivalric court legends; it also pokes fun at the Illiad, popular tales and even common peasant stories. The heads (complete with helmets) sliced in two by a single sword blow are taken from The Illiad, in which Greek champions perform similar feats, although in Orlando Furioso, literally hundreds of men meet their end in this manner to the point of becoming amusing in a way. And I found it strange to notice a very clear similarity between the story told by an innkeeper in the book and the prologue to a translation of a 13th century version of the Arabian Nights (translated by Hussain Haddawy). Ariosto had no possible way to know of the existence of the Nights, but still it is interesting to see how truly close the two incidents are: In Orlando, two men who have given up on the possibility of women being chaste, take one woman and watch her day and night, yet she still deceives them in their own bed. In the Nights, a demon has locked his wife inside an impenetrable castle, yet she still deceives him as he sleeps right next to her in bed. The two events are described similarly, with the same irony (being meant as a joke which the author denies believing in in the least). The book is funny only in the way reading Candide is funny. This is simply another example of what makes the book enjoyable. During the reading of Orlando, somewhere about 3/4 of the way into the book, the reader may wish that it would end right there and that two characters; Bradamant and Ruggiero should get married and finish the story. But the continuation of their separation and further adventures is just another parody of common legends, exaggerated out of proportion. In the end, with all its jokes and its surprisingly individualistic narrative technique, its more serious scenes (the most touching of which is when a woman named Isabel is killed) forms into a large picture, with a great deal of good atmosphere, such that when it ends (although the reader may not have been touched very much during its reading) will want it to go on",1,6.674343116818105e-123,1
"That's what it is...It's a book that takes a few key concepts and embellished it to reasonable thickness so as to hit the stores looking good.

This isn't just a cute tabletop book with pictures of your favorite stars and cute trivial snippets (come to think of it, there's no big discography in the back !)- - its a well researched book that tells a great American/Afro-American story... (think of it, a racially integrated record label in the South circa the early '60s and moving on into the militant '70s that managed to turn the Northern recording establishment on its side !) It really gives you a glimpse of what was going on behind the scenes, how the sound evolved and the various personalities entered into the sphere and did their thing... the conflicts, the struggles, the accomplishments and the whole scene, bottom up... very tough to put down.

"Before I bought this book, I admit that I (like most people) knew of Dorothy Parker only through her pithy one-liners and wisecracks (i.e. ""men don't make passes at girls who wear glasses"", or commenting that a performance of Katherine Hepburn ""runs the gamut of emotions from A to B""). However, this wonderful compendium shows a much more versatile, prolific Dorothy Parker - she truly is much more than the bitter joker most people think.Although her short stories (including the oft-anthologized 'Big Blonde', as well as lesser-known gems such as 'Too Bad') formed the main part of the original 'Portable Dorothy Parker', this newly revised version includes those stories but also a wide variety of dramatic and literary criticisms (including a very enjoyable, incisive review of a performance of Oscar Wilde's play 'An Ideal Husband'), poetry, and letters. I found the letters to be especially fascinating - even when Parker was writing to her family and closest friends, she was still remarkably witty and erudite. In addition to the content by Parker herself, I thoroughly enjoyed the introduction by Marion Meade, the author of the Dorothy Parker biography ""Dorothy Parker: What Fresh Hell Is This?"" Although I have not read the previous edition of 'The Portable Dorothy Parker', I have heard that the introduction was very unpleasant because the writer seemed to not like Ms. Parker. Luckily, that is certainly not the case with Marion Meade's introduction - she obviously greatly respects Ms. Parker's body of work, and the introduction (which is really a 15-page biographical sketch of Parker) gives an positive impression of Ms. Parker overall, without glossing over the more unsavoury aspects of her life (such as her alcohol and sedative addictions).One inclusion in this version of the 'Portable' which I found especially intriguing as a transcript of an interview Dorothy Parker did with 'The Paris Review' in 1956. It really gives a sense of Ms. Parker's personality, and shows her views on a number of topics (including her own description of the famed 'Algonquin Round Table', of which she was a member).Lastly, the cover art for this version of the 'Portable' is absolutely fantastic. The cover is fanciful withough being needlessly silly, and the inner flaps and the back cover use whimsically retro line-drawings to illustrate, among other things, the major happenings in Dorothy Parker's life. The illustrator (Seth) has really done a great job making sure the work of Ms. Parker doesn't look too stodgy to the casual eye.I urge everyone to pick up a copy of this book, and discover the genius of Dorothy Parker for themselves - my words simply cannot do it justice",1,1.3159534757955e-64,1

"This book is about the life of two middle-class children who are living in Korea in the years 9140-1945. It tells the story of a girl by the name of Sun-hee which means ""girl of brightness"" and her older brother by the name of Tae-yul which means ""great warmth."" Many things happen to all of the members of there family. As the Japanese begin to gain more and more control over Korea the less people are allowed to speak and write Korean. Sun-hee and Tae-yul face many challenges, many they overcome and many they do not. I really liked this book because you get a taste of what the Korean and Japanese think of us. You also get to learn a lot about Korean and Japanese culture and what life would be like as a child and adult, what struggles they would go through, and much more.

"Timothy Gallagher recently published a book on the form of prayer called the Examination of Consciousness, a prayer of daily discernment of God's presence and activity in our lives. The value of that book is the extensive detail with which he examines each of the elements and aspects of that prayer. This book, on the other hand, is particularly valuable because of its simplicity. It summarizes the Examen in two simply questions, which may be posed in a wide variety of ways: what most and what least gave you life today. By holding on to what gives us life (in the words of the subtitle) we progress more and more into God's will for us and away from the things that God does not wish for us. It puts the moral life into a positive mode much wider than the commandments, and situates its essential nature in God's desire that we have life in abundance. The one fault of the book is that it looks too much like a kid's book and many adults may not get beyond the cover. But the book is designed and the prayer is presented in such a way that both book and prayer can be easily used by children, couples and families. This adds a wonderful communal and educative dimension that the prayer usually does not have; its suggestions can draw couples and families closer, and train children in on-going daily discernment. And of course it is usable by individuals as well. Do look beyond the cover, it is a book for all.",1,2.440091292249983e-204,1

"Grandfather Twilight is one of the best picture books, for everyone from the youngest toddlers to the grandparents that read it to them. I rank it in the top four of my favorite picture books, along with Turnbull's and Foreman's The Sand Horse, Blyler's and Blake's Finding Foxes, and Clements's and Kiesler's Temple Cat. Each of these books offers, in the simple format of a picture book, the sort of profound concepts that form the basis of the greatest literature. In the case of Grandfather Twilight, Barbara Helen Berger presents a beautifully illustrated myth of her own creation, giving young readers a gentle introduction to the concept of metaphor in its anthropomorphic title character. The text is classically slight and spare, and so able to avoid any hint of saccharine condescension. The surreal illustrations manage the neat trick of being bright and vibrant, while conveying a feeling of soothing calm. Berger has written and illustrated several other excellent picture books, including Animalia, and a wonderful book for older children, Gwinna. These, along with Grandfather Twilight, will be on children's shelves for many generations to come",1,1.8389782404167144e-43,1

"I can't believe this is only just now in its second edition -- my 20 year-old copy seemed like ancient wisdom at the time I got it... Back then, scanners were new and very expensive technology, so the book focused on the theory applicable to photography-based techniques. One needed to be well-versed in the science of photography (knowing physics helped) and human color vision to follow the book, but what it dealt with was great. All relevant aspects of color reproduction systems (esp. halftone systems based in inks) were dealt with in some detail, so for the very technically inclined the book was a goldmine of solid thinking and information -- even if many of the literature references were even then several decades old. Though the basic principles never change, I'll be interested to see whether the new edition has been sufficiently updated and revised to keep up with the revolution in the field the last two decades as things have moved over increasingly to electronic/digital ways of doing things",1,4.466760793346692e-36,1

"Yes.

In any case, if you don't mind putting in the work demanded by this text (blood, sweat and tears is not an exageration), I must say that this text excels at the task of teaching this very difficult language. The language (and its beauty)is all about detail and the precision with which the Greeks went about creating their personal representation of their conceptual take on the world in general. It is not just about reading skills. The way the language is structured can tell you as much about the people as can their composition. I also used additional resources for help when clarification was indicated, but this became my main text.

"Seyyed Hossein Nasr, a reviver of the Islamic intellectual tradition and expositor of those traditional doctrines associated with the Sophia Perennis, or al-Hikmah al-Khalidah as it is known in Islamic intellectual discourse, has provided for those pursuing the illumination of the Spirit through the way of the Intellect with a seemingly constant flow of treatises touching on nearly every aspect of what is known as the Din al-Islam. This particular work seems to be Nasr's final word on the subject of Islamic philosophy; conclusions arrived at after many decades of study, teaching and contemplation. The chief aim of the work can be seen in the following quote from the second chapter: ""This philosophy [Islamic philosophy] remains of the greatest pertinence to the contemporary world because of the harmony it has achieved between logic and spiritual vision and also because of the profound metaphysical and cosmological doctrines it contains within the pages of its long and extended historical unfolding. Furthermore, because of the present encounter of Islam with an alien philosophy and science--this time from the West--Islamic philosophy must be called upon once again to play the role it fulfilled in early Islamic history, namely, to provide the necessary intellectual instruments and the requisite intellectual background with the aid of which Muslims can face alien philosophies and sciences from a position of discernment and intellectual rigor. Otherwise the encounter with the West can only result in calamity for the future of Islamic intellectual life and threaten even more than what happened in the colonial period the continuation of the life of falsafah itself. Only in remaining true to its own genius, to its own roots, and to the role it has always played in Islamic history in a land dominated by the reality of prophecy can falsafah (and hikmah) fulfill its vital function of providing the Muslims themselves with the necessary intellectual background to confront the modern and now postmodern West and to remind the world at large about the long-forgotten but urgently needed truths that Islamic philosophy has been able to preserve within its treasury over the centuries and that it is able to present in a contemporary language to the world today."" (pg. 47)Nasr's genius lies in his birds-eye perspective and his illuminating commentary on the history, development and spiritual underpinnings of Islamic philosophy. Unlike modern scholars and historians of Islamic philosophy, and their Muslim imitators, or Muslim scholars who wish to compare this or that Islamic philosopher with some modern philosopher or another--a boring preoccupation on the part of certain Muslims educated in Islamic philosophy who seek approval from the dominant philosophical currents of Western modernity--Nasr constantly reminds us that philosophy, when pursued within the framework of the Islamic tradition, or within the ""land of prophecy"", is not an inquiry into the phenomenal world with phenomenal ends in view, nor the endless, labyrinthine analysis of those possessed with an obsessive mental passion, but an inquiry into the very nature of things in view of reinstating the intelligence back to its original sanctity. When Nasr maintains that Islamic philosophy ""remains of the greatest pertinence to the contemporary world because of the harmony it has achieved between logic and spiritual vision"", he is referring, in my mind, to the culmination of the Islamic philosophical project in the grand synthesis found in the Eastern lands of Islam. While there exist several ""schools"" which deal superbly with systematic metaphysics and the sciences of realizing the end--one of the most popular and direct being Advaita Vedanta--they don't enter too deeply into the domain of discursive philosophy and natural science. In the West--which serves as the model for the rest of the world now--these two traditions of inquiry became more and more separated from each other until discursive philosophy eclipsed metaphysics altogether; sending the West into its current spiritual, philosophical and civilizational bankruptcy. However, the synthesis established by later Islamic philosophy between peripatetic (mashsha'i) philosophy and the metaphysical/theosophical (al-hikmah al-ilahiyyah) discourse of the Sufi sages harmonized discursive philosophy with what Suhrawardi called ""Divine Philosophy"". Islamic philosophy, if properly taken account of, offers the West many important insights which, if considered seriously, could help in placing a derailed Western philosophical tradition back on its tracks.Nasr's outline of the history and influences which flavored different schools of Islamic philosophy is very intriguing, such as the Hermetico-Pythagorean influences which came in through Isma'ili philosophy. Nasr also gives ample room to a Nasir al-Din Tusi, Hamid al-Din Kirmani and Nasir-i Khusraw, enormous philosophers almost totally neglected by Western studies of Islamic philosophy, as well as reclaiming 'Umar Khayyum from the imagination of the Orientalist. The great merit of this work is the introduction of many Muslim philosophers who never make it into those histories of Islamic philosophy (sometimes clumsily referred to as Arab philosophy) written by Western scholars, who believe that ""Arab"" philosophy died after the death of Ibn Rushd. Some of these later Muslim philosophers, like Fath Allah Shirazi, Shams al-Din Kafri, Ghiyath al-Din Mansur Dashtaki, and Jalal al-Din Dawani are introduced with the hope that scholars in the West will turn away from the endless analysis of Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd and begin to study their works as well; especially since in many cases they offer a greater balance between philosophy, that is, man seeking to know the Real, and the call of Revelation - the Real disclosing Itself to man.",1,3.576214347449953e-30,1

That it's a quick, easy read doesn't hurt either. Her structure falls apart a bit at the end, mostly because she obviously enjoys weddings and loses her critic's focus.

"I read this book about two years ago while sailing in and around Vancouver Island. The book made me forget that I was on such an adventure. &quot;Standing In&quot;, the first of three novellas contained within, absorbed me and effected me so deeply that I can remember the exact feelings I felt at the various places on the boat.

"My wife bought me this book because she knew I wanted to lose some weight, get more fit, and most of all, lower my blood pressure and get off these damned drugs. I was worried it was going to be the same old stuff about eating less and working out more, but I was pleasantly surprised. The book moves fast, makes great points and offers real advice I've already put to use. So many books give you an exercise plan or a diet program without talking about how to deal with the stress from work and keep up a healthy relationship at home. This one does, and it makes following the program so much easier. I'm working out more, eating better, happier with my job, and having more fun with my wife and son than I was three months ago. To me that means Chris's program works. And I, for one, really appreciated his straightforward delivery style - he tells it like it is and isn't afraid to point the spotlight on mistakes he made in his own life in order to illustrate his point. Overall, it's a great package. The recipes are great, the meal plans are easy to follow (especially with the shopping lists), and I'm already seeing great results.",1,2.140102672376159e-36,1
"If you are a fan of ""real"" Punch and Judy shows, this book is for you. The author has captured Punch's lively spirit from the stage and put it in this verry funny picture book. All the classic characters, the crocodile, Judy, the baby, the police man, etc, are all here, and the illustrations have a sense of the wonderful rythmic comic timing that is vital to a good Punch puppet show. This book does contain classic Punch style violence, and is maybe not for the youngest of childern, but the author has an excellent afterward that explains the tradition of Punch and reminds the reader that his actions and violence are not real, and would not be ok in real life. It would make even make an excellent spring board for a talk with your child about this issue. This book is a very enjoyable, funny read for older childern and adults alike, and I would hate to see such a wonderful character as Punch lost to a generation because we were too wrapped up in trying to be P.C. to talk and read with kids.",1,2.7323182184349987e-139,1
"This story seems written by a resident of Alexandria; attention to detail is such a vital ingredient of a convincing story, particularly in historical fiction, and Trent's got it here in spades. A second, happily surprising discovery is the ability for this male author to breathe life into a female protagonist. Much like Wally Lamb's Dolores Price in ""She's Come Undone,"" Hypatia is written as intelligent, but also with a genial wit. Her battle against The Church makes her an archetype hero, but the way she is written makes her likable and unforgettable.The story moves quickly, and the message it imparts could not be more suited to the issues of the day. At once a somber warning, and a wonderful read",1,2.1388802890511734e-32,1
"This book is the only one I have found that goes extremely in depth into shot composition. Great book.

"I found this book several years ago and recommended it to a friend, a struggling artist who couldn't seem to find the color yellow. She got to chapter eight before the elusive color found her, and she went on to create beautiful murals and ceilings for celebreties and football players(Jim Kelly, for one.) She got sick, and asked me if I knew who she could speak to, as Doctors didn't seem to know what was wrong. I suggested a woman I had heard of through the grapevine, but P.K. never got to see her. My lesson was that I had known of the book, and of the woman for years, but never thought about others being interested, or of helping them find it. This book is for anyone who wants to get in touch with the the divine gift of creativity in any form. P.K., I have learned. And for those who want to know who the woman was who probably would have saved P.K.'s life, read, ""Forget The Cures, Find The Case,"" by Rayna Gang",1,3.601565792163727e-35,1

"A long overdue book. Copeland collects together Turing's greatest papers. As in where Turing tackled the fundamentals of what is now called a Turing machine - ie. a universal computer. Plus other papers where Turing ruminated on artificial intelligence, and founded that field. Plus coming up with the Turing Test for AI.Turing's papers are interleaved with chapters by Copeland that give extra context to the times in which Turing lived. Notably on Turing's crucial contribution to the Enigma project at Bletchley Park during World War 2. It is no exaggeration to say that his insight into decoding the German encryptions saved the lives of thousands of Allied soldiers. Valuable also is a reprinting of Turing's ""Treatise on the Enigma"", which was only declassified in 1996. Though by then, its essence had been known for decades. Finally, the book lets you read Turing's words on Enigma",1,0,1
"To include Jane Fonda in the same catagory or breath as Elenor Roosevelt or ""Di"" is a travesty and disgrace. Jane has an over inflated ego, puts her ""body"" before brain power, and flaunts her anti-american beliefs in the face of all Americans. Yet, through the mechanizations of the press, television, and powerful and influential people like you, she can get away with it...to some people. Ever since the 1970's and Tom Hayden and the ""peace-nik's"" she has degraded this country, our veterans and our Honored Fallen. She is NOT one of the great women, if I had to give her a catagory she would fall into the classification with: 1. Jane Fonda, 2. Lucricia Borgia, 3. Lizzy Borden, 4.

She has done an excellent job in presenting much of the documented evidence of the reality of the positive influence on and the existence of &quot;spirit&quot; within all things, especially as related in the Hebrew and Christian scriptures.

"I throw several large get-togethers, plus many smaller, more intimate gatherings every year. In my neighborhood we're known as the ""party house"". I LOVE entertaining and I love being able to do something different each time. This book gave me several wonderful tips, new recipes (that can be prepared and stored) for last minute pop-ins, and ideas on how to raise the bar on my own parties. My last one was this past weekend, we had 40+ guests for a White Elephant gift exchange. I used several of her recipes, but the one that I heard the most raves about were the spiced/carmalized nuts. They were easy, I was able to make them days before and they were wonderful! While I wouldn't say all the recipes are ""last minute"", most of them can be made ahead of time and completed last minute. This book was very entertaining as I seem to share her sense of humor and found it a delightful read. I'm actually purchasing 2 more for hostess gifts..",1,1.4740214634425046e-09,0.9999999985259785

"Economics for the laypersons has become the topic ""du jour."" This book written nearly a decade ago before economics became hot far surpasses its successors such as ""Freakonomics."" David Friedman does not dumb down economics like the others. Other reviewers who had at least a rudimentary interest in economics really enjoyed it. A few others who confused economics with their own political views predictably got frustrated with it. Economics is not always intuitive. As a result, several reviewers thought the author made mistakes regarding the graphs on page 29, or the example on housing on page 35. I reread these passages carefully. The author is accurate, it is just that these economics concepts are counter-intuitive. And, contrary to Steve Levitt in ""Freakonomics"" David Friedman did not shy away from tackling the inherent complexity in economics.The book gives you a good foundation in both macro and microeconomics. Very early in the book he introduces and graphs demand and supply curves, marginal costs and revenue curves, utility functions. His coverage of international trade, taxation, subsidies, rent control is excellent. Along the way, you will also learn about investment theory and corporate finance. Friedman explains how the Efficient Market Hypothesis applies not only to stocks but freeway traffic and supermarket lines.Friedman also gives full credit and fleshes out the ideas from the founders of modern economics, including Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and Alfred Marshall. This is unlike Steve Levitt in ""Freakonomics"" who truly believed he was the first economist to tackle every day issues forgetting that economics is the science of understanding everyday behavior to begin with.For further reading, if you want to pursue an econ refresher I recommend an actual textbook: ""Principles of Economics"" by Gregory Mankiw. This is a textbook with a hip and humorous attitude. The Economist, the British magazine, raved about it when it came out. I also recommend Gary Becker's ""The Economics of Life"", and Steve Landsburg's ""The Armchair Economist.",1,5.457730974862851e-42,1
"Kind of tedious but effective, this book gets you working on a weird sample web site at first (""Virtech U. The School of the Future"", or something) in a series of lessons that take seem to drag on and on and get you itching to work on your bands web site. But it really does give you a good idea of how the tools, windows and palettes work. It's definitely better than a ""for dummies"" book (not as dumb), but it's still pretty easy to wrap your mind around. Out of all the books I've been through for CS2, this one is by far the most comprehensive, and I'd recommend the Adobe books over any others. Very solid and accurate information, straight from the source. Thank You.",1,9.308152049171468e-32,1

"This is a cleverly constructed book of several parts and a few recurring motifs. Jones, a Welsh Methodist, Everton FC supporter, London hack and Oxford (Arts?) graduate, goes to live in Parma, Italy where his beloved has established herself. He divides his book into nine separate chapters and tries to weave them together as well as his excellent English and his motifs will allow. The first chapter discusses nuances of the Italian language and he uses those nuances to propound that Italy is a much more nuanced country than England and that its culture is infinitely more refined. An entire chapter brings the nuances of Italian culture to bear on football and he waxes very lyrical about the local youth and whatever immigrants are around playing ball as the sun goes down. The football allows us to place Italian village life in our minds and to empathize very much with it.The last chapter is an entire ode to Italy. It is written largely in the second person and it tells of ""you"" going through the village and everything there appealing to the aesthetic in ""you"". The English is beautiful and it achieves its purpose in making you close the book with a warm glow. Mission accomplished.The chapter on Italy's Catholic religion and its Protestant and other minorities could have done with much improvement. Italy's Catholicism is more complicated than the Padre Pio cult and the Protestants of the north surely have their faults as well. The chapter looks like it came from several previous publications he wrote.The politics chapters build on the hypothesis that the fascist and proto communist factions are still at war with each other and that politicians like Berlusconi exploit this for their own nefarious ends. He does a good job of tying the warring World War Two factions in with the protagonists and antagonists of later squabbles. He does not like Berlusconi and his polished prose does not quite hide this fact.My opinion of this book is that Jones sat down with his material and tied it all together into a very passable but rather superficial book which is nevertheless well worth the money being charged.",1,2.8254371046278347e-130,1
"This is my first Blackford Oakes book and it happens to be the last in the series. So, I am happily looking forward to reading all the others. And if this was one of the weakest of that series, as other reviewers here allege, it looks like I'm in for some great reading because I found this to be a most delightful book -- well-written, good plot, good characterization. Fascinating look at how things worked -- or didn't -- in twilight Soviet Russia. I think I'm going to like Oakes as a protagonist as I plow through the other books. All in all, it was a good and rewarding read",1,2.780840454003072e-106,1
"I came to this book via the exquisitely beautiful album by the English rock band Camel, inspired by this short story. And what a story! Written in simple but beautifully constructed prose, it is short enough to be read in an hour, yet the story will last forever in the memory. It's simple enough. Rhayader is a deformed man who is shunned by the world. He lives alone in a lighthouse, caring for the geese which live on the Essex marshes. Then a teenager from the village, Fritha, finds an injured Snow Goose and plucks up the courage to take it to him. She visits every day until the goose, now healed, migrates, than his loneliness returns. With the return of the goose, Fritha's visits start again. Eventually, the goose stays and their relationship is gradually going beyond friendship. But this is 1940 and Britain's army is trapped at Dunkirk. Rhayader takes his boat to help in the rescue, proud that he can, for once, ""be a man"" and is accompanied by the faithful goose. After saving many lives, he is attacked by German planes and killed. The goose flies home but does not stay, leaving Fritha alone.This may be primarily aimed at children but is also suitable for adults; however, have a ready supply of tissues. Best read while listening to the Camel album as they complement each other perfectly",1,2.448674948080624e-118,1
"I have to admit, that I was suprised to see that this book got such a high rating, as it was the one in the series that pushed me away from Xanth. I finished it and was overcome by a sense of pointlessness in reading these books that must have begun with &quot;Demons Don't Dream.&quot; The older books are much better, when the author actually had a story to tell, it seems unfortunate that now Anthony spends his time with Xanth in attempts to fill it with what he thinks are clever puns to appease the fans who send in their ideas, when really in my opinion, the puns are just plain annoying. I suggest Anthony stops cranking out Xanth books so quickly, and instead tries to think of some interesting stories to tell, although I have to say, there are signs of improvment with the most recent books, &quot;Faun and Games,&quot; for example",1,2.649941883599529e-90,1
"I used this Genetics textbook of Griffiths et.al when I was an undergraduate student at University of Michigan. The best part that I got from this book was its excellent problem sets given at the end of each chapter. Having taken several courses of Genetics, I believe that the best way to master this class is to practice as many problems as we can. This book is therefore a good start of a long road. Another strong part of this text is its clear and beautiful pictures. The authors may not use many words to explain the concepts but the pictures they show is spectacular. The organization is up-dated to balance between classical and molecular genetics. This book might be a bit expensive. yet it is worth having it if you plan to work in this field",1,8.144742889509477e-34,1

At no time did I speak to anyone other than computer generated messages, a situation probably designed by the Amazon people.

"A wealth of important information in this book. It covers many power-mongers the world over from food and drug czars to private military contractors (SLEAZY!) to political corruption to organized crime and many things in between. It makes some inferences that it shouldn't every now and again, but that doesn't diminish the achievement this book is. It just attempts to expose some of the shady goings on of today's world. And there are some dark implications in some of this material indeed. For those reviewers that have made this into a left vs right debate, the book isn't really about that. I get the feeling these people read only the chapter on the New Right Wing and then put the book down. That said, the Neocons are an important subject today, and the chapter on them was very warranted. After all, the book exposes the slimyness that are their own actions rather than cheaply smearing them. Whatever, this isn't as unidimensional as leftist party-schlepping.Aspiring agents of change will find much to love in this book.

Isn't this perpetual struggle to find &amp; grasp an elusive happiness precisely what gets so many of us tied up in knots?

"I am lucky enough to live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where ""shojin"" cuisine (Japanese Buddhist temple cuisine) is served to two wonderful restaurants: Cha Ya and Medicine. I often say ""I could live on that cuisine,"" so when I discovered Fujii's cookbook, I was thrilled. The recipes are so simple but divinely delicious - and of course healthful! Many of the recipes call for only 5 or 7 ingredients, some of which may be unfamiliar at first. But, after your first visit to an Asian grocery or even the Asian aisle of your supermarket, you'll be ready to master this cuisine. As a vegan cooking instructor and a lover of this simple but elegant cuisine, I have prepared many of the dishes in this book and recommend each one as highly as the next. The simplicity is amazing, and the flavors are divine. You'll love this book",1,6.093189194316359e-51,1

Plots graphs with coordinate labels that even the figure captions can't explain succinctly. The graphs offer no intuitive insights.

"I am a children's librarian, with many years' experience with preschool storytimes. This is a classic concept book, and one of my favorites. As a read-aloud, I like it better than Eric Carle's more recent Little Cloud. The repetition not only engages the children, it makes it easy for them to respond successfully. ""It looked like ..."" gives them a chance to identify the shape, with no wrong answers, because the next phrase is ""But it wasn't a wasn't a ..."" for all. By the time the last page revals that ""It was just a cloud in the sky"" most of them have guessed,and are pretty proud of themselves. It might be too long for many groups (he wrote it for a pre-television audience) but it is easy to skip pages or speed up. Makes a great feltboard using quilt batting.",1,1.4305413999007163e-48,1

"This Dvd is a beautiful glimpse into the world, and work, of John Santerineross, known as the leader in this genre, of art photography,he treats us to all the photographs in both of his books, ""Fruit of The Secret God"", and ""Dream"", he includes a montage of film clips taken while he composes his pieces, and a short art film about a shocking subject(cutting), done very tenderly, so as not to shock. This little film, in spite of breath taking visuals, is not so much eye candy, as it is mind candy, leaving a hauntingly, bittersweet, after taste on the tongue. The images are living assembelages of religio-sensual elements, presented through a dream like filter. The sepia tone photography, evokes the feeling of, a memory,a strange familiarity, regarding our desires and fears. His work is a wild roller coaster ride, which, thrills, and at times, terrifies, and leaves you wanting to ""go again"". The images of women portrayed in this work, are a refreshing respitefrom the mainstream images of women that, we are bombarded with daily in the media. Like REAL women, each image begs to be studied for content. The film itself is not long but is filled with so much information, so much to process, it is an epic in its own right. I highly recommend any of John Santerineross's work, to lovers of neo- symbolist, art, photography, and erotica. To other artists like myself he is truly an inspiration.",0,1,1.611253023726917e-125

"""How to Succeed"" is an energetic and snappy satire of big business. As the story opens, J. Pierpont Finch (Robert Morse) is a poor but ambitious window washer; he finds a ""how-to"" book that can teach him to climb the corporate ladder in no time at all. Ponty follows the book's advice and advances from the mailroom of the World Wide Wicket Company to become its president, falling in love with secretary Rosemary (Michele Lee) along the way.The movie looks like a staged play, and that's a good thing, since this was such a smash hit on Broadway. It preserves forever the look of the early sixties with vibrant colors, pillbox hats, and references to Metrecal and Wildroot Cream-Oil. The unique Robert Morse is the whole show here. He originated the stage role of Ponty and this movie made him an even bigger star. He is a great singer and dancer, but it's his irresistible personality and charisma that keep you rooting for him. Michele Lee is perfect as his leading lady, and Rudy Vallee reprises his stage role as the singing, dancing, and knitting Big Boss. This is a happy, fun movie.Kon",0,1,3.208595019307952e-29
"If you are a fan of Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, you must own the new 50th anniversary DVD of CAROUSEL (1956), starring Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones. The restored color, 2.55 ratio wide-screen for CinemaScope 55, and remastered sound are awesome. This is like opening night in 1956 New York.CAROUSEL is based on Molnar's Hungarian play LILIOM, which was filmed by Fritz Lang in 1934 France with a superb Charles Boyer. A complete studio print of Lang's LILIOM is just one of many bonuses on disk two. Rodgers and Hammerstein added some of their most memorable songs (""You'll Never Walk Alone,:"" ""If I Loved You,"" ""June is Bustin' Out All Over""), built up the role of Julie to make her a strong and likeable heroine, and gave the whole show a Heaven framework. (LILIOM has Julie in a supporting role, no songs, and Heaven only shown in the last reel.) Billy Bigelow is a carnival barker in a New England seaport (location filming was done in Maine) who loses his job, marries shy and lovely Julie, gets her pregnant, then dies during an evocative clambake. (I won't give away more details here). The play and film are in flashback from up in Heaven, so I haven't really given away too much plot.Ample disk one bonuses, besides the restored movie, include an audio commentary with Shirley Jones, isolated music score, songs only option, and Karaoke sing-along. Besides all of the 1934 LILIOM, disk two has a TV kinescope excerpt of John Raitt and Jan Clayton (from Broadway) doing ""If I Loved You; a filmmaking featurette; musical outtakes from the movie; Fox Movietone newsreels of Darryl Zanuck crowing about the glories of the short-lived CinemaScope 55, and the New York film premiere; and an ample stills gallery.You really get your money's worth if you love musicals and invest in this brand-new DVD of CAROUSEL.",0,1,2.0724491271115478e-57

"The story has everything in it, including tragedy and dark humor. The main theme is revenge, but also apotheosis: a Samurai breaking with the definition of his life to be true to his inner self. He calls the Samurai code a ""facade"", and then proves it by kicking butt in the most realistic one-man stand I have ever enjoyed in movies. This film has the most realistically correographed sword fights I have ever seen. None of the fashionable flashing swords and furious (jiggly) camera work that typifies filmed sword fights, especially in recent years. Even in 1962, this was a uniquely faithful depiction of kendo - the discipline of the ""perfect cut."" The fighters like to stay well out of range until they can attack or counter attack without getting hurt! ""No duh."" But how many movies really show this natural caution in fighters? No others that I can think of off-hand.This masterpiece blows away Kurosawa's stuff, which I also enjoy a great deal. Harakiri is just as artfully done, both the cinematography and the direction, but it is far more realistic visually. (I am glad it was in black and white!) It is very tight and fast-paced, despite a lot of scenes where people are just looking at each other and talking. I wish more films were this balanced, instead of the steady move toward more gratuitous action and less drama that feels connected to real life.The characters are alien in the way they act, to American eyes, but their emotions are completely reachable. Harakiri is a perfect reminder of why I enjoy foreign film so much: it puts me in touch with humanity from another place and time. And being in touch, I know that we are at the core always the same. Tradtion and culture do not change our emotions or desires for happiness. And family lies at the very center of achieving it, or becoming so grief stricken that we welcome death.(A technical observation about correography of sword duels in films: this film has the right feel about what we see. I think that depicting a sword and shield duel in Viking Iceland would, if authentically portrayed, show the same thing: a lot of long range circling and feinting, with constant eye contact, and a few bursts of attack and reaction.)",0,0.9999999991224505,8.775494034877275e-10

The scenery: beautiful Mexico (again, as in the title mentioned above).The subject: the Law and the Spirit of the Law. Believing (in something/someone) and carrying on without thinking of it. As Shannon (Burton) puts it, we live on two levels: the fantastic one and the realistic one. Deborah Kerr later says, living on the realistic one is doing what one has to do.This movie is a gold mine for those to want to explore the spiritual realm, and at the same time, can check on his church's spiritual health by comparing it to the one represented in the ladies from Corpus Christi, on their tour of Mexico.

"To me, the most fascinating aspect of this movie is that Henry seemed to be utterly ignorant of the differences between boys and girls. When I was growing up, nudity between the sexes was utterly taboo - we had to be very careful to explore each other without alerting out parents. Those little kids who did not have or take those opportunities invariably said the sexual differences were that boys had short hair and wore pants and girls had long hair and wore dresses. Henry either never was able to see the physical differences between the sexes, or he did so late he was psychologically unable to accept the differences. Thus, he drew his naked little girls as he would have imagined them as a little boy - like his body, but with long hair. Unable to relate to the opposite sex, which also would have made him an oddity to his own sex, he withdrew more and more into his own imaginary world. In an effort to make sense of his life, and possibly to find some social acceptance, he grew into a faithful Catholic. He might have felt at home in the Church because he learned sexual mores through the Catholic orphanages he grew up in, and then those mores were reinforced through the Church in homilies and other teachings of the late 19th Century and early 20th Century. This movie is a study of this interrelation between his utter lack of knowledge, yet fascination with little girls and his absorption of the catechism of the Catholic Church. To create his own reality since he couldn't comprehend the larger social actuality, he wrote and drew the world as he saw it within this context. The movie, especially to one who is interested in sexual paraphilias or sexual immaturity in an adult, is interesting in this respect",1,0.4642038750510837,0.5357961249489163

I choose to look at it that way because that is the only way that this could ever possibly be funny. However, the real jokes are that Tom Hanks took the same material and impressed critics and audiences with his acting skills while Adam Sandler just amused a few people who watched this film. The other joke in the film is Adam Sandler's voice. He kept changing it. First, he had a mild southern accent, then he just began talking slower and faking a stutter.

"This is a very disturbing tale based on true events, which makes it even harder to stomach, but it is an important reminder of how horrible the death camps were. May history never repeat itself in this case. The dark story of the holocaust and events at Auschwitz are even darker when considering that there were some willing to betray their own people in the hope that they might survive, even if only for a while longer. When a handful of the prisoners plan an uprising, their plot is complicated when a young girl is revived, having somehow lived through the gas chamber. Though the scenes of the crematoria are graphic and very chilling, this is a movie to watch if you can deal with some tough realities. This is definitely adult-only material.Chrissy K.

"After a couple of box sets of CSI, it is so wonderful to be watching Inspector Barnaby deal with murders that involve more ratiocination than chemical reaction. After peering at corpses in various states of disassembly it is great to see only the occasional shot of stage blood-- although Murder on St. Malley's Day has one truly grusome moment that can cause you to drop your popcorn! Snobbery and felony keep things going at a ively clip on Barnaby's patch",0,1,1.2190291671855336e-34
When I first saw this movie I didn't think I would like it because as for the previews I saw it looked somewhat corny but then when I watched it I thought it wasn't that bad of a movie. I like Matthew Broderick as Inspector Gadget he really did a great job but as for the sequel I thought the sequel was horribly bad and the actors couldn't act. I do agree that the first Inspector Gadget is corny but it's still fun to watch as it's based on the popular cartoon series. Though the characters look really different then the real characters in the cartoon but it's still a great movie. Just don't bother seeing the sequel it's bad.,0,1,0
"This is one of the most clever, metaphorical, and stunning movies ever made. I have not seen many other films that are this flawless. Rock Hudson, Robert Stack, and Lauren Bacall are all perfectly cast - Robert Stack in particular is very effective (and believable) as this spoiled son of a texas oil hancho who turns to alcohol for his failed personal relationships (impotence). If you are a fan of Fassbinder, Almodovar, or John Waters you know just how inspirational Douglas Sirk's film is - truly a masterpiece",0,1,4.830666500532251e-134
"Bad, bad, bad movie. Bad. Insipid acting (particularly on Theron's part), horrible writing, it's unbelieveable, paper-thin and most of it is truly boring, despite the backdrop of war, death, Nazis and Paris. It takes a genuine lack of talent to be able to pull that off. While the costuming and the soundtrack are fantastic, the movie looks like it's been set on a soundstage producers would use in the 40's, I had a hard time believing most of the sets were on locatio, and they just looked fake. And the ending, pooh. By that time, you barely care about the characters and hope the thing just ends quickly. A very irritating a cheesy movie, it tries desperately to be aloof and melodramatic at the same time. Ugh",0,1,2.6786935598774246e-39
"Is someone actually expecting high art here? I've read the negative reviews, and have to wonder what these people were expecting. This is a fun way to kill a couple of hours, and the plot is not at all bad when you consider it has to bend and flex to provide multiple story-lines.My only warning is about the endings...I made the mistake of watching this with my seven year old, and he got pretty attached to old Regdar...when the party is summarily wiped out at the end, he was pretty bummed. You forget it's interactive, so you naturally expect a (somewhat) happy ending; some of the endings are pretty ugly",0,0.9991523381430023,0.0008476618569976637
"When I ordered this DVD I knew a bit about the life of Fr. Damien but nothing about the film. I expected it to be &quot;pleasant fare&quot; but not much better. What a surprise! Molokai is as near to being a perfect film as could ever be made. It is an interesting and inspiring story that is told without any of the over-sentimentality one might expect from a &quot;religious&quot; film. The screenplay is wonderful - absolutely believable and natural dialoge delivered flawlessly. The cinematography is breathtaking and the soundtrack is, well, I'm going to track it down to buy it - a first for me. So much for the technical stuff. Fr. Damien was an extraordinary individual and an ideal priest. The film portrays this with great respect as it does with the Catholic Church in general - another rarity these days! There are at least a dozen scenes that stand out as illustrations of true virtue in practice and from which we can draw inspiration to improve our own characters. This is a beautiful film in every sense and will remain in my top 10 list of all time great movies",0,1,2.323524321053062e-55

"This movie is so incredible, I don't even know where to start. Robin Williams is great in this movie, it's one of his best performances hands down. Annabella Sciorra is perfect as his suicidal wife. Cuba Gooding Jr. gives a surprisingly touching and impressive performance as an angel. And who can forget the dalmation?? The plot is heartbreaking: After losing their kids, Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra are trying to cope when Robin dies trying to save a life. Anabella dives into deep depression. From heaven, Robin tries desperatley to reach Annabella. She ends her own life and he spends the rest of the movie trying to reach her in hell. Their kids have surprising and delightful roles in his quest. The imagery in this movie is top notch, especially for 1998! Heaven and Hell are depicted so incredibly real, I felt as if that may actually be what they are like. The concept of 'soulmates' takes center stage in this touching melodrama. It's the ultimate love story and tradgedy. Let me warn you- have tissues nearby before even the hardest person is likely to cry at this movie.",0,1,5.717311691485705e-103

"Paradise Now is not a film about politics. Director Hany Abu-Assad creates suspense enough to make you feel like you're watching a thriller, but at its heart this is a stirring document of the lives of two young men of occupied Palestine.Filmed on location in Nablus, the story opens with Khaled and Said being notified that their suicide mission is to take place within the next 24 hours. As the clock winds down, we watch their handlers lead them through their last rites, first in a series of religious ceremonies meant to sooth their consciences, and later in a last filmed statement to fan their simmering hate. At first it feels like you're being set up for a James Bond type movie - all flash and sizzle with no substance. But when the mission goes awry and the bombers get split up, their fear, their doubt, their shame - the things that make them human - begin to seep out around the edges of their hate and resignation and at last you begin to see what it is that motivates Khaled and Said, young men who would otherwise be chasing girls and racing cars, to strap on a girdle of explosives. Credit goes as much to the actors as to the director/writer for allowing these characters to shine and to step out of the shadow of stereotype.The film does not glorify or excuse the bombers. In fact, the point of view character, the Western educated Suha, condemns them while pleading for a new course, a new way of thinking and resisting that does not require random violence. If the film makes any point at all, its that the eye-for-an-eye tactics of the Intifada and the Israeli government cannot lead to a peaceful resolution of the conflict. And that is most certainly not a political message.",0,0.9995608164164369,0.0004391835835629775

"Bad Boys is a solid prison drama starring Sean Penn (State Of Grace, Fast Times At Ridgemont High), Reni Santoni (Cobra), Ally Sheedy (The Breakfast Club), Alan Ruck (Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Young Guns II), and Esai Morales (La Bamba).Penn plays Mick O'Brien, a menacing delinquent, who after a failed heist runs over a boy with his car, gets arrested and confined to a juvenile prison where he must deal with a couple of bullies. In the meantime, the brother of the boy he ran over and killed, a hispanic delinquent named Paco Moreno, played by Morales, is not satisfied enough; he wants to kill Mick, so he gets himself arrested, and follows him to the same prison for a bloody and relentless showdown.Bad Boys was released in 1983, only one year after Sean Penn's star making role as pothead Jeff Spicoli in Fast Times At Ridgemont High. Boys proved that Penn was more than just an onscreen goofball, but an actor who can take on characters of different dimensions. Recommended",0,1,1.9881465289664053e-29

"Condor is the code name for an employee of the CIA. His mission is to read, read everything he can to see if there are any subversive codes being posted in innocuous looking literature. In the book he discovers that the number of packages shipped to his location do not match the bill of lading. He brings this to the attention of his superiors. One day he leaves by an un-recorded unauthorized back door for lunch. On returning he finds everyone dead. Who did this and who can he trust? To survive he must use his wits and what he has learned from his reading. The movie ""Three days of the Condor"" is based on this book, which is really first in a series of books, sort of like the James Bond series. Naturally being film media the story needed cutting down to size, hence three days instead of six. Robert Redford has to squeeze James Grady's ""Six Days of the Condor"" into the Redford mold. The book plot of drugs and Viet Nam are out. Redford's substitute plot of oil and Arabs is in. Bad guys differ. Great acting, great actors and a few faux pas, such as if they knew there was a back door to the location, don't you think it would be watched? Tina Chen (Janice) can be seen again in the movie ""Paper Man"" (1971) where her computer prints out ""DEATH DEATH DEATH""",1,5.1569026926580826e-36,1
"The film is very thought provoking and doesn't mind pushing buttons or boundaries to achieve this end. Although I agree with another reviewer's (Dexter Tay) assessment that this film certainly pertains to Sartre's ""Hell is the Other"" view, I do not believe this film is more arthouse porn then art. I find it very interesting that the reviews are fairly divided between the sexes. Females seem to rave about this movie and males seem to find things wrong. Hmmmm. This film is basically two characters, one female and one male (names aren't used because they don't matter - they are ourselves) who are complete strangers and come together to discuss the real view they have of the ""Other"" as well as themselves. The setting is very bare as there is no need for props - it is the inter-relationship that is front and center and no diversions are allowed. So even though there are several graphic scenes, be prepared for much more dialogue and philosophical discussions between man and woman then actual sexual content. Also, the very graphic content is there for a specific purpose and it is not titillation. For example, the tampon scene is a little too detailed for my comfort but that moment shows the whole point of this amazing film. It was NOT about the female lead's bent toward self-mutilation as one reviewer suggests (sooooo male), otherwise every female who used tampons on a monthly basis would be carrying out a deprived act of self-hatred?! Rather, the diametrically opposed views held by men and women about the most basic and intimate nature of things. Two scenes stand out from all others: (1) when the women opines on the ridiculousness of the sanitary outer covering of a tampon to prevent intimacy. The very act by its nature is intimate. Why are men and women horrified by menstruation? This topic is delved into with such honesty that the viewer automatically shies away. I'll admit I closed my eyes in one scene; and (2) when the man complains to another about the way the woman let him debase her, allowed herself to be made to wallow in her own piss and excrement (no scenes of this, thank goodness) and with every humiliation, she asked for more. All the while he is disgusted by her, he is haunted by his own actions. The whole movie makes compelling comments about us as men and women. Catherine Breillat (director) presents a piece of work (based on her novel entitled, ""Pornocrate"") that forces the viewer to confront issues buried by morality or social conventions. I applaud her brilliant effort.",0,1,8.12570549929251e-93

If you like the idea of werewolves and have squelched your way through the muck and mire which is the genre this is one of the few examples of quality. The fact that it spawned so many of the worst as sequals says more about Hollywood than the film.But forget them. This movie shows what can be done when the script is first rate and the filming is done with a light touch. The special effects still hold up after all these years. By far the number one reason this movie shines though are the characters. It will never matter how flashy a movie looks if the writing sucks the movie is worthless. Even the characters who only get a few minutes of screen time seem more life like than the leads of some movies. Most of the time a new werewolf movie comes out I'll see it and pretty much every time I have to lower my expectations to find something enjoyable about it. Not so with the Howling. I forgot to lower my expectations it was so well done. All I can say is see it and you'll understand,0,1,1.1189535698526423e-172
"Since I uncovered this tragically overlooked gem in Hollywood's crown, thanks to NY Times and their list of 1000 best films ever made, I've watched it four times and it just gets better with repeated viewing. That alone is a tremendous recommendation for anyone who likes a good romantic comedy, especially if you've found yourself let down by the more mindless entries into the genre (the recent ""Must Love Dogs,"" for example).Some fine synopses of ""The More the Merrier"" can be found elsewhere on this page, so I'll not be repetitive. Let me just say how wonderful it is to find a film that perfectly captures that magical moment in time when two people have the locomotives of their lives derailed by finding each other completely by accident. Well, OK, not completely; Mr. Dingle is the engineer of this particular train wreck, the sheer joy of which is not fully clear to anyone until the final five minutes of the film, an ending that is so beautifully planned, constructed, and executed that it gives me goose bumps.The other marvelously pleasurable aspects of this film include the realistic way the dialogue unfolds. Most films have had the life rehearsed out of them; ""OK, I say this, then pause for a beat so the audience can laugh, then you say this while I wait to respond to what you've said."" In TMtM, on the other hand, characters sometimes mumble, dialogue overlaps, there are scenes when two characters seem to be ad libbing at the same time, etc., just like the viewer is a fly on the wall rather than watching a polished Hollywood product. Ah, 'tis a rare and precious thing, this.And finally, TMtM reminds us how sad it is that today's films usually substitute nudity for sexiness. I have rarely seen a sexier scene than the one where Joel McCrea is walking Jean Arthur home. He just can't keep his hands off her shoulders, neck, and face, and she half-heartedly fends him off; she has a loveless engagement to be married, and he is a distraction...but ultimately she can't withstand her own feelings for him. It's heartbreakingly sweet and sensuous, without being the least bit prurient. Beautiful work.Obviously this has quickly moved into the top 10 of my own personal list of 200 favorite films, and it carries my highest recommendation without reservations.

"This is a first hand perspective into the world of pimpin. If you have no respect or interest for pimping, pimp game or just an open minded curiousity in wanting to learn more about just what pimpin in the modern age is then you have no business writing a review or anything else about this movie. I don't like hockey, Nelly and alot of other things, that being said your not going to see me writing reviews for something I have no knowledge about or any interest in.

"I am a cyclist and runner and I was looking for something to suppliment the Rodney Yee (the BEST yoga DVDs available) DVDs that I have. I bought this one specifically because it claimed to have workout designed for different sports. Well, it was a major let down. This tape is for absolute beginners only. It has zero flow and it frustratingly slow. They spend several minutes on each pose, and not holding the pose, but just slowly getting you in the pose and then holding it for 10 seconds after two or three minutes of explanation. Its maddening. There's no continuity. I would imagine that if you are an true beginner this DVD might be marginally useful but once you mastered the basic poses it offers, you would then lose interest in it because of it's painfully slow pace.

"Quite interesting, and well worth viewing, if vaguely irritating in its exposition of religious belief in the final program, though I wouldn't say this segment is out of place or inappropriate as included with the other material. The series is well-done and certainly expounds its material with clarity and concision; some of the subjects in the final segment look silly, that's all. Perhaps, as has been said many times by many people, such subjects would be more benignly tolerated if they themselves were more tolerant of others, and learned once and for all to cease attempts, by a variety of means, to ""force"" everyone else to live as they do. I might have placed the evolution/religion program in the middle of the series, rather than concluding with it, so as not to end on so meaninglessly contentious a note.The other segments, while only very slightly dry, and only on occasion, do manage to complete a portrait of evolutionary theory as compelling as it is informative",0,0.9999999948077799,5.1922201252128085e-09
"This story is so much about the setting, in the Ozark Mountains, where growing pot is one of the few ways to make enough money to keep your land, where men drink and drive as long as they avoid the downtown area, where rednecks clear out the fish fry for a fight in the parking lot, and where a bluegrass jamboree is a way to while away a humid evening. The scenery is beautiful, but everyone's isolation is tragic. The bar fight is one of the best scenes, with no professional moves, just a heck of a lot of slapping, kicking, and stumbling. There is nothing suave about the bar fight. The realism was beautiful, especially as Thornton's character let his arch enemy get a riled up while Thornton himself remained steady.The movie starts out slow, but the action in the middle is powerful, and the ending is a sucker punch to the gut. The characters are vivid and true. This is a haunting tale about loss, guilt, and redemption.",1,5.942274167655732e-52,1
"I think this is one of the best Bob the Builder videos we have. It's pretty funny seeing how Wendy has to come to Bob's rescue when he tries to hang wallpaper.

As the daughter of a Mr. Fixit, I have learned and used many of the things I was taught as a youngster and Wendy makes it appear to be just ""normal"" for girls to do these things and not weird.

"The Montreux series is a gift for Jazz/Rock fans and Van Morrison' DVD is no exception. Moreover, this series catches most of the artists in their pick or prime time while they were in the best shape. Van Morrison always walks between different types of music and has no real borders- the mixture of streams and trends gives him a unique style. In the 1980 show one can hear a very happy and content Van Morrison who even goes for a jumpy Reggae style version of ""It stoned me"" while the 74' show is slower and in a blue style. In both shows Van Morrison is in its best and, of course it's a celebration for the funs. The quality and sound of the DVD is perfect.",0,1,4.4863995950419966e-64

"This film is so extremely heart-warming throughout ... until the very end ... when it becomes exactly the opposite, heart-breaking. The story is completly absorbing and fascinating. The viewer is captivated and caught up in the lives of Mancho a young boy who begins school for the first time, his older brother who plays the saxophone who later finds a Chinese girl with whom he falls in love, his father a tailor, and his teacher Don Gregorio. The kind elderly teacher helps Mancho adjust in many ways by providing personalized individual attention. He helps open his mind to learning about nature and literature. Mancho has asthma and his mother worries about how this will affect her son during school. In one scene, Don Gregorio helps Mancho avert a respiratory crisis ... In gratitude for the help given to his son, Mancho's father makes a new suit for the teacher, free of charge. This innocent act will eventually be turned into something cruel and unexpected when the political climate of civil war causes the citizens to denounce each other ...There are numerous endearing scenes between Mancho and Don Gregorio as the teacher mentors his young pupil. Mancho also learns many things about life and the world in the manner boys often learn, from friends. For example, he and his friend visit the local tavern where a male patron describes/brags to the local bartender about his physical love relationship with a local female. The two boys follow the patron to her home where they spy on their liason ... One of the funniest scenes is when the ladies dog, Tarzan tries to bite the boyfriend's naked butt as he is engaging in making love to her. The boyfriend is enraged by the dog and his constant barking and later exacts revenge in a very cruel manner ...This film shows how fear and the threat of persecution can cause ordinairily good people to become cruel. It shows how the mob mentality takes over when one's own life is at stake. The sad fact is, it is the survival instinct which kicks in. It is something we all possess and very few people can rise above the crowd to do the moral and right thing ...Erika Borsos (pepper flower",0,1,4.4047874741759423e-185
"Captain Kirk is transporting Shakespearean acting group led by Anton Karidian to Benecia Colony on Planet Q.Prior to arrival, Dr Thomas Leighton contacts Kirk wishing to inform him of a new synthetic drug he created, but instead tells him that Karidian is really Kodos the Executioner, tyrant of Tarsus IV, responsible for 4,000 deaths, including members of both Kirk's and Leightons family.

"I remember first watching this movie with my parents shortly after it came out on video. I was not a fan of baseball and basically thought I'd hate it. Wow was I ever wrong. I absolutely loved the movie. And the music is beautiful. James Horner outdid himself in this movie.Well when I saw that the two disc anniversary edition was coming out I ordered it right away. The bonus features are great. There's a story on how the movie came to be, a biography on W.P. Kinsella (the author of the book), commentary, and much more.But those features on the DVD are not why I bought it; I bought it because this movie is just incredible. It makes you believe that the impossible really can happen. The messages that Ray (Kevin Costner) gets give me the chills...the way in which they are delivered is great. 'If you build it, he will come,' 'Ease his pain,' and 'Go the distance.' Well this movie certainly went the distance.The music is what really makes the movie great. The music we hear towards the end of the movie give me the chills and it just makes me cry...in a good way. You don't have to like baseball to like this movie.

The subtitles are truly terrible, sometimes bizarre, and I thought at times I was dreaming I was watching a Monty Python skit. Alas, I was not; this was for real.

"At the beginning of this long film the audience sees a spectatcular view red dirt and red mountains of Burma, which is very significant because, if one is familiar with Buddhist tradition, the dust symbollizes the mortal world of suffering and it represents what one wants to brush off if one desires to follow the path of the Buddha. After seeing the bleak terrain, the audience is introduced to a small contigent of soldiers led by Captain Inoue a former music teacher. In order to keep his troops spirits up, the Captain teaches his men how to sing with varying degrees of success. His most gifted soldier is Mizushima, who has taught himself how to play a Burmese Harp which he has mastered quite skillfully. Trudging along the harsh landscape, The soldiers find shelter and food in a small village. The villagers feed and shelter them, but when the soldiers want to perform a song for them, the villagers turn their backs on the troops. Later they learn that Japan has ceased fighting. Captain Inoue and his men peacefully turn themselves over to the British. However, other pockets of Japanese soldiers are still fighting. Captain Inoue asks Mizushima to inform one group of soldiers to stop fighting and give themselves up. After talking with the British Colonel, who gives Mizushima thirty minutes to make peace with the Japanese, Mizushima speaks with the commander of the Japanese forces, but instead of giving up, they fight to the bitter end and are completely wiped out by the British. Mizushima survives, but is seriously injured. He is discovered by a Buddhist monk who nurses him back to health. One day, while taking a bath, Mizushima's clothing is stolen, so he dones the robes of a Buddhist monk and also shaves his hair. He travels around and is given food by devout Buddhist people. At this point Mizushima's main goal is to reach Mudon and be reunited with his unit, but after seeing hills made of the bodies of deceased Japanese soldiers and funeral ceremonies performed by the British for fallen Japanese soldiers, he takes a new path to bury the bones of his fellow soldiers. However, his old friends have not forgotten him... This movie is based on Takeyama Michio's 1946 novel of the same name, which has come under some serious criticism because of its portrayal of the Japanese soldiers as a basically happy bunch victimized by the Britsh, when in fact the Japanese brutalized Burma, China, Manchuria, and several other countries. However, this film was created some ten years after the novel and was directed by Ichikawa Kon, a humanist director. So, when you watch the film take it with a grain of salt, but don't let the salt get into your eyes and keep you from enjoying this film.",0,1,4.190250152036263e-34

"First of all, yes, this film was made in Vancouver, with only a few shots of the Manhattan skyline. When Golden Harvest was making this film, they had to try their best to shoot at angles that didn't show any mountains, and they had to paint grafitti each day and unpaint it each night. Then Jackie Chan told them to simply forget all of that and focus on the action.Well, action was what they focused on the most indeed. It sure is funny to see how the Chinese thought of the United States at this time, because what you see in this film are hippies that drive around in trucks full of beach balls. You also get multi-ethnic gangs trashing places (seriously, the gang has a Native American with pigtails and a frayed jacket! That's almost offensive). You have fat cops that just sit around smoking cigars. You have random, small-crowd rock concerts where everyone is dressed up in animal suits! Bizarre indeed.As for the actions, this film has some of his best. The first fight scene in the grocery store is supurb, and graceful, using his jacket to dispatch enemies, and endlessly hitting the same guy in the nose over and over. He takes on the entire gang in a back alley before getting cornered, very impressive. This leads to a scene where he's being chased around the streets of New York, where the entire gang, on motor cycles, try to run him over, and Jackie must rely on his ability to run like the wind and climb like a monkey. He also does a dangerous stunt where he jumps from the roof of a parking garage onto a fire escape of another building. No harness or wiresupport! The fight scene at the gang's hideout is also one his best, using whatever object he can get his hands ont, and very acrobatic. Also, Jackie Chan has to cling to a hovercraft while it drives on water and land! Some of this was done on a broken ankle!If this DVD was uncut and undubbed, and had the original score, I'd give it a total of three stars. Unfortunately, for a so-so film, New Line makes it worse. Some of the dubbing is very bad. It seems as if New Line dubbed some of the original English dialouge also. Only very, very little of the original Cantonese dialouge is there. Also, the film's original score has been redone to a more orchestrated score with slight rock. Many, many scenes were cut from the original movie. Not only that, but some of the action scenes were cut too. Try and find an uncut version out there. This DVD you should stay away from",0,1,3.586709525760542e-106

"I first saw this movie some years ago but only seriously started reading about Shakespeare, his life and times since then. Recently I had the opportunity to see the movie again, this time on DVD. The movie, although an imaginative creation, is well rooted in historical realities. Shakespeare was a commercial artist in commercial theatre, Shakespeare's plays were the popular entertainment of his day, the City of London regularly threatened the 'low brow' theatre entertainment industry with closure, Shakespeare often wrote parts for his favourite actors and his theatre's stars. All these aspects are illustrated in this rollicking screen play. And it leaves us with the question, surely Shakespeare must have been in love to write of love so passionately. This irreverent production is actually uplifting. Shakespeare was probably the greatest artist of all time, but he wasn't an inhabitant of some ethereal Mount Olympus, he and his work is down to earth. That's what makes him and his work great",0,0.9999928091178477,7.1908821522102375e-06

"I read most of the reviews of this phone and agree with them. I would never buy another GE phone. In fact, I am waiting for my new Uniden cordless phone to arrive from Amazon. In the meantime, I tried this experiment yesterday. I took the battery out of the phone, then sprayed the keys and talk button in front with 409 Orange Power. I really doused it good. After that, I blasted the phone with steaming hot water, so much so that the screen fogged up. Now, after that I shook the excess water out and duct taped the phone to a fan, with the buttons facing the fan. Today I hooked the battery back up, put everything back together and tried it. It worked fine even without a charge. I didn't have to keep pressing the same number 3 times to get it to register. It worked similar to when it was new. I've done this with stereo receivers by taking the cover off, putting them in the bathtub, squirting them with a spray cleaner and blasting them with a hot shower. Then I put them in between two fans for THREE days. After that, they work fine. I'm sure I'm not the first person to do this.

"Although I prefer the AKG K701 for most of my listening, this competing entry from Beyer is so close that it's almost a coin toss. (One recent comparison in a headphone artcle came up with a dead heat.) This is surprising, considering that the DT880 is one of the most reasonably priced of the major mid-priced headphones. The bass is full but nicely textured - not a touch of bass bloat to be found here. The highs are detaied and never seemed sharp to me, and the overall sound offers a huge soundstage. Instead of the music being on top of your, these Beyers lend a perceived distance of a few feet; ths makes classical music sound doubly elegant, and surprisingly makes rock music grandiose in an appealing kind of way. These headphones don't require a headphone amp, but certainly profit from one. The 30 ohm version makes for more volume, though the 250 ohm version is standard, and best for most daily listening. The DT880 sounds great, but lacks a tad of the K701's high-end sparkle. Conversely, Beyer's value, comfort, and workmanship can't help but impress. This is a phone that has labored under the shadow of the AKGs and the Senn 650s, but listeners are always impressed by the DT880s sound.

I have 2 large 18qt canners that I can vegetables and meat in and one has a dial gauge and the other is a weighted gauge that makes a hissing noise.Of the 2 canners I prefer the one that hisses because I can be doing other things in the kitchen and surrounding rooms and know that the canner pressure is not getting too high or too low because I can hear it.One has to constantly monitor the dial gauge because it does not make noise, it is just like a kitchen thermometer and has a hand that points to the present pressure the canner is at. Many times my dial gauge pressure has gone too high only to turn it down and it goes to low.So for me the weighted gauge canners are the best because I can hear the hissing noise and know whether my pressure is too high or too low.I love this canner it is very user friendly and easy to operate.I have tried making cheescake which came out very well I just made a meatloaf last night that took me 15mins to make.My husband just loved it.The company is very accessible I called them because I noted a small dent in the pot of my new canner and they told me to return it.I emailed Amazon and the very next day they had a replacement canner on the way.Amazon provided a return shipping label and I just used the box that I had gotten my new canner in to mail the dented canner back.I am very impressed with Amazon they have great customer service.I love this canner and would not hesitate on buying another Amazon had great prices on this canner also",0,1,5.175154148324171e-70

"This is another one of my all-time favorites from the great horn-band era that was initiated by the success of the rock/jazz fusion group ""Dreams"", as well as Blood, Sweat & Tears and of course, Chicago. Along with Tower of Power, Cold Blood blasted out of the Northern bay area of California (their 1969 debut actually came out on Bill Graham's San Francisco label before TOP's first disc)with female vocalist Lydia Pense fronting a sometimes changing lineup that retained its' core membership throughout most of their releases for a bit less than a decade. This is their most sought - after album, now finally available in the U.S. on compact disc (a Japanese import CD pressing was available on a limited basis but was extremely difficult to obtain - I've never even seen a copy of it). And at one point, you couldn't even find much by them, except in cut-out bins; or purchasing from second-hand dealers(who knew the market and worked it)at some fairly steep prices. Now, thanks to Rhino; with their classic series of top - quality reissues; you can own a clean-sounding copy of this original Reprise release. Like most fans of the band, I've purchased the majority of their works on vinyl(I went thru two copies of this one..)! Now you can get almost everything in their catalog on CD; with the exception of their 1976 release on ABC(absorbed by the merger with MCA/Universal); which also was my only opportunity to catch the band 'live', for two ""killer"" shows in San Diego! Since most of the major labels are now mining the vaults for older things to release, though; that one might eventually become available too. But for now, get the best of their San Francisco and Warner/Reprise years on CD(especially this) and you'll have the really happenin' stuff...!",0,1,6.328672142108854e-26
"Is there such a thing as a ""perfect"" album? There is now. This is Wynton transcending unto a higher plane. Creatively, musicly, soulfully, and above all artfully. His constant drive to achieve music of a sophisticated nature on par with Ellington has brought him to this amazing recording. Like any great work of art no matter how smooth or abrasive regardless of medium this is simply beautiful, and quite possibly a musicians worst nightmare. From the Plantation... is the result and accumulation of diligent work. A trate lost to most artists. It dosn't suffer from immature statements that often tend to result in a sterile outcome. This music breathes and moves. Given Wyntons stellar output for the last decade, this album does not surprise me. On the contrary I knew and know that Wynton is capable of higher art, just how high I didn't know. His band is now an institution, a working unit that is as rare as the finest gem. Delfeayo has hit a new target as well. Production is second to none.

Even though the first two releases were Great Albums, this one is unreal. If you want to hear some increable Guitar Work from Tom, this is the Album to pick up. Not only does the band sound so Complete here, it is also the Heaviest album that Rage would do. I cant reccomend this album enough to fans of Metal and Hard Rock. Even though some have classified it as Nu Metal, I believe it to be mroe of a mix of Hard Rock and Hip-Hop which some bands over do (Limp Bizkets) and some pull off nicely (Linkin Park) yet Rage pulls it off the best, because Zack is a great vocalist, and Tom and Company are very good musicans. I think Tom might be one of the most under-rated Guitarist of the Modern Era, and Trust me that Guitar Players will love the effects that Tom gets here from Running his Guitar though a wah-wah, and God knows what other kind of trickery he has up his sleeve.

"Let's face it, Phil Collins ruled in the '80s. Both with his solo career and with Genesis, Phil was a HUGE commercial force, and it's a case where the commercial success was truly deserved--throughout the decade, this guy gave us a godlike amount of deeply moving and intoxicatingly catchy music that had a wide-ranging appeal. How could you resist the guy?Released in November of 1989, ""...But Seriously"" is a somewhat transitional effort for Phil. With the possible exception of the album-opening ""Hang In Long Enough"", Phil completely abandons the synthesized dance-rock sound of ""No Jacket Required""--drum machines are still very much present, but they're used much more moderately, with Phil's real live drumming in full force on all of the non-ballad numbers this time around. And, as the title suggests, Phil gets more capital 'S' ""serious"" with the lyrics, tackling such issues as apartheid, ghetto violence, and homelessness, in addition to his usual introspective and romance-themed material. Phil had begun to really put his money where his mouth was in the late '80s/ early '90s regarding the homelessness issue, a theme which can actually be traced all the way back to ""Man On The Corner"" from Genesis' 1981 ""Abacab"" album, but Phil makes it much more explicit here, particularly on the huge hit ""Another Day In Paradise"".Phil's move away from 'just-plain-fun' a la ""Sussudio"" and toward more political writing seems to have been partly an attempt to silence his detractors; this backfired somewhat, as his attempts at social commentary were accused of being overly simplistic, and I'll admit there is some merit in this accusation. There's a visible formula that Phil established here and would continue to use on his next couple albums--use a series of scene-setting verses, then alternate it with a chorus that features a 'one-line summation' of it all, such as ""it's just another day for you and me in paradise"" or ""that's just the way it is"". Phil himself admitted in a promo interview around the time of ""...But Seriously""'s release that he's ""not a very well read person"" and that he lives his life ""by common sense"". All that said, Phil's attempts at social commentary here are undeniably earnest, well-intentioned, and generally quite thoughtful. Two of them feature striking harmony vocals from David Crosby--the moody ""Another Day In Paradise"", with its creepy intro, arpegiatted guitars and pensive guitar harmonics (from Dominic Miller), and swooping bass line (from Leland Sklar), is heart-wrenchingly beautiful; and the Northern Ireland-themed ""That's Just The Way It Is"" is also really moving and typically atmospheric. The 8 & 1/2+ minute ""Colours"", about South Africa, is a musical tour-de-force, starting off with a gorgeous ballad section, then featuring a percussion-drenched segue which eventually gives way to a rousing, uptempo, horn-laden pop-rocker, and the quasi-coda really brings closure to this epic track. ""Heat On The Street"", which Phil originally wrote for The Four Tops, swings along with an irresistible catchiness, punctuated by great wordless background vocals.""Hang In Long Enough"" is kind of an ironic album-opener. People had already accused ""Sussudio"", the opening song on ""No Jacket Required"", for sounding like a rip-off of Prince's ""1999"", but ""Hang In Long Enough"" takes this a step further, with the main riff being an almost direct clone, but it's an incredibly fun, rousing song in its own right, with Phil going all-out vocally.As for the rest of the big hits... ""Something Happened On The Way To Heaven"", co-written by Daryl Stuermer and originally written for the movie ""The War Of The Roses"", is uncharacterically weak, with the lyrics being a virtual cliche-a-thon. But there are a couple of terrific lost-love ballads including ""Do You Remember"", with a soaring middle-eight and Phil's close friend Stephen Bishop singing all of the song's background vocals; and the majestic, gospel-ish ""I Wish It Would Rain Down"" which features Eric Clapton on lead guitar.""All Of My Life"" is a tender ballad that feels a little generic for Phil, plus it blatantly derives from the Tootsie theme ""It Might Be You"" which, not so coincidentally, was performed by Stephen Bishop, but it's still affecting, and enhanced by some tasteful Hammond organ playing from Steve Winwood.The album's penultimate track is the heart-wrenching ballad ""Father To Son"", written for Phil's then pre-teen son Simon. And the closer ""Find A Way To My Heart"" is a joyful uptempo feel-good tune with great spirited vocals from Phil.So, despite the minor gripes, ""...But Seriously"" is still a masterpiece by any realistic measure. The weakest tracks are hardly bad, and even if you ignore them, you're left with so much prime Phil Collins material, no one in the right mind could possibly go wrong.(P.S. There are a load of non-album b-sides from this era, including an intriguing 3/4 time demo of ""Another Day In Paradise"" entitled ""Homeless""; the super fun, riffy pop-rocker ""That's How I Feel""; and another quality pop-rocker with ""You've Been In Love (That Little Bit Too Long)"".",0,1,1.7464931666330487e-99
"First of all, let me say that i think Billy Klippert should have been the Canadian idol. Buy his album as it is far more superior to this one in every way. Now, objectively speaking, i do believe Ryan Malcolm has a nice voice in its natural range, but at times Ryan is stretching it in this album. I believe most of the songs sound the same, and truly there is just not enough variety on this album, at times i feel like im listening to elevator music. I think if the producers took alittle more time constructing this album the result wouldve been alot better. Now i do think his release single &quot;something more&quot; is catchy, nice hooks and sentimental lyrics, but unfortunately its the only gem on this album. Buy the single and forget the album. I believe Canadian idol fans should give Billy's new album a try, YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!",0,1,2.572264019043663e-41
"In general, I've grown more than a little weary of hard bop. That's my disclaimer.However.Roy Hargrove may be the finest purveyor alive of this somewhat tired and hackneyed music. Hence, how can I not give him five stars? I can't.That doesn't mean this is my favorite kind of music. Personally, I think Hargrove's disc Habana achieves greater heights. It fully integrates an authentic world music vibe ably mapped onto transcendent jazz. Nothing Serious, as accomplished as it is (and it is VERY accomplished), still operates within a rather shopworn and safe zone of music, i.e., hard bop, and seldom transcends its genre.What I wish Ray Hargrove would do is meld his two projects, RH Factor and this acoustic project, to come up with something truly distinctive. Habana comes closest to that, and I implore him to continue to explore that and similar musical amalgamations. Otherwise, I fear he will become more safe than dynamically exploritory--a kind of Wynton clone.And, heaven knows, we certainly don't need another one of those",0,1,2.7238105087061887e-98

"Whatever was a good crossover single between the sounds of 'definitely maybe' and 'morning glory'. It is also one of their best radio songs meaning everyone has heard it, but may not own it. I'm assuming this song will be included on an Oasis 'best of' compilation one day, but until then, this is a must have for all Oasis fans, as it is unavailable on any other Oasis release unless you were lucky enough to get the special bonus disc release of 'definitely maybe'.

"Musically, this album is layered from beginning to end with dreamy instrumentals. The beats...trip hop, drum and bass, or whatever you want to call it, really grooves. This is my current favorite cd. While most electronica seems to loose itself while repeating dull lyrics and focusing on just keeping a best, hooverphonic keeps their songs strong with killer guitar riffs much like Spicehouse and the heavier songs by Zero 7. Hooverphonic delivers in my opinion pure beautifull dreampop, with Liesje Sadonius sexy voice, and haunting very emotional music. To me they are comparable to only a few other bands. Don't try to label this music. Some call it trip-hop, some ambient, some dream-pop. It does not matter what you call it-just, call it great. Hooverphonic is one CD you can enjoy no matter what type of mood you're in",0,1,2.216310432106712e-97

"When it comes to jazz cds my collection heavily favors the classic artists like Miles, Trane, Monk, and Mingus. But I would put this recording right up there with any of the heavyweights. Lovano's technique is superb and his range is impressive. Schuller's arrangements of some classic as well as original material is on a par with Gil Evans' collaborations with Miles. Particular favorites here are some of the ballads (Angel Eyes, a great Lovano tenor solo on Chelsea Bridge), and Schuller's &quot;Lament for M&quot; a poignant ode to his late wife.

"I have to say that I really enjoyed this album from the first listen-through. The songs all follow the same theme of Love and Happiness, which was nice to see from Barbra, whose few albums prior to this effort had tended to be on the melancholy/serious side.Here, we hear Barbra singing about her love with her husband, James Brolin. The songs she uses to emote her feelings are deliberate. There are no filler songs in this set upon listening.Barbra's wedding song, I've Dreamed of You, is a beautiful Irish melody which she had turned into a song. The purity in her voice and sensitivity she gives to the interpretation makes you feel like you were there with her when she made her vows.Isn't It A Pity has a great harmonica solo in it which lends itself to the orchestration well.The title track pays respect to Barbra's Oscar-winning song, Evergreen and is a pleasant song.Barbra's duet with Vince Gill, If You Ever Leave Me, is a fun song as well. Their voices blend well and the country twinge that the song has is carried over into the next track - We Must Be Loving Right.There are also some songs on this album which scream Classic Streisand, and for good reason:The song which is simply called Wait is a haunting melody written by Michelle LeGrand and fully puts Barbra's ability to express the lyric to use. Her phrasing on this song is magnificent.The final song, The Music That Makes Me Dance, was the original closing number for the Broadway version of Funny Girl. Barbra must have sung this song live hundreds of times over the course of the production's run in the US and London. With that said, her approach to the song on this album is renewed and still full of the angst and punch that you would have gotten had she been singing it 40+ years ago. This is a great closer to the album.I truly enjoyed this album and hope you will as well",0,1,1.3750001091246365e-36
"JB is one of my favs, and this recording shows that he still one of the best out there. While his music and style continue to evolve and change, the work continues to be tip top.

"Here Come the Waterworks' blew me away, with it's thick bass, sparatic drumming, and deep vocals. Big business create a sound of their own, however you catch familiar influences throughout the cd. Imagine a heavier version of the who/sabbath mixed with some atmospheric pink floyd in some areas. Really it's hard to compare to any other specific band, but anyone who enjoys thick proggy, bass-driven music will enjoy this journey. My only complaint is that, once it grows on you, you find yourself wanting just a little more than 8 tracks. It's really nice to hear a band that brings back alot of what heavy, classic rock/ metal are all about.",0,1,3.2120357466161354e-35

"An excellent selection, covering a wide range of modern and folkloric Chinese music. The album starts out on a shaky note, with a long rock song by Cui Jian that sounds kinda like Sting and The Police -- not my cup of tea, but it certainly lets you know that this is a collection that's going to break up our stereotypes of what &quot;Chinese music&quot; sounds like... And indeed, this set runs a gamut of sound, from the traditional twangy lute music we know and love so well, to many other styles -- folk-rock, anthemic children's choruses reminiscent of the Maoist years, operatic pop, etc. It's an impressive collection representing some of the best music to come from this once-closed society.

"I first discovered The Grays back in early 1994 with &quot;The Very Best Years&quot; and was hooked by the hook. The rest of this masterpiece is rife with melodic textures and every track is a standout. This is a masterful combination of some of the finest elements to be found in rock and the influences here are apparent, with a good deal stemming from 60's &amp; 70's tunesmithing and overtones.

Even though Kimbrough keeps the sound that you're probably familiar with, he still has some new tricks up his sleave, like kenny brown's slide playing.

"I think this is the single best Bill Frisell album. I call it a Bill Frisell album because it is his musical sensibilities that dominate the feel of the album as a whole. Not surprisingly the playing by Dave Holland and Elvin Jones is fantastic; it doesn't specially feel like their other work, though. It has much more the spacy, moody feel of Frisell. I would recommend this as one of the 10 or so most important albums for someone trying to get a sense for the directions of modern jazz music. This is not jazz in any traditional sense, but it is music made by players deeply embedded in the jazz tradition, coupled with the pursuit of originality that has characterized jazz music from its inception. This is one of my favourite albums, and I especially appreciate its demonstration of the incredible musical power that can be mustered by a trio; (not unlike, in that sense, the album &quot;Question and Answer,&quot; by Pat Metheny, Dave Holland and Roy Haynes)",0,1,2.407827531879929e-68
"It's been 16 years since this great double lp came out. Funny how it took it a year to make congess go crazy over nothing. Before the right winger's got rilled up over this the album had yet to hit gold. Shortly after that it went national that Boward County tried to ban this and failed so, on to the supreme court...it went overnight multi platinum cause everyone wanted to know what the fuss was.....So, it finally got out of Miami Clubs and NYC clubs and everyone knew what it was from 4 year olds to 84 year olds....Lesson here if those few idiots didn't make a fuss this lp would be a lost record.... Yet, anyways this was a good album. Fun pure and simple. The 2 Live Crew brought that heavy Miami Bass that in the mid ninties would become huge for awhile. What makes this album stand out besides heavy bass is some of the best scratching ever. Plus, these guys sampled some of the best songs ever.... Son of a preacher man, van halen guitar solos (the first van halen lp the only good one) jimi hendrix, a little of Eric B and Beastie boys be dropped in get loose now and just so, many others to mention. Yet, unlike modern rap where it's lets find the most obscure crap and then loop loop loop. They added fresh mixing and scracthing and their own heavy bass lines. Theres so much that can be said on this album the crew was at a changing point when this came out.... Some songs were drifting away from the goofyness they were know for but, others kept that old flaver there. After this the hype and controversy more or less destroyed these guys yet, they got their money and moved on. While Luke blew his chunk and went on to prove to the world he wasn't the true creative force behind this lp with his crappy solo albums. Most of them contained songs from this very lp to make up for the non talent dumped into them. He's been more succesful with his cheap porn films the first to blaze this before other hip hop artist. Me so horny may be the gold single on this album but, i'd have to say the best song on this was Get the F--k Out of My House..... You cant beat these lyrics.... You come into my house you eat all my s--t the dog should of bit you but it didn't get the f--k out of my house b--ch. And If you believe in Having sex always had a catchy chant...

"I saw Kate Bush in a dream last night, for only the second time (the first was before the release of _The Sensual World_). This is why I am here now.I first heard Kate Bush on the radio while on the graveyard shift at work, in 1985. I was intrigued by the unusual sound of the music, and for a wonder, the DJ actually gave the name of the song, the album, and the artist -- it was Kate Bush singing ""Running Up that Hill"" on _Hounds of Love_. I went and bought the album, and though it didn't hugely impress me at first, it grew on me. The music on this album has a cryptic mysterious quality that one finds only in the greatest of art. All of Kate's albums are at least very good, but this one is the best, and is my all-time favorite (see review title).

"The intensity and speed with which these guys play is simply frightening - it's inhuman actually and there are moments in the recording where I literally have to press stop and catch my breath. OK, so that is overly dramatic but not too far from the truth. The virtuosity on this 1976 album is mind-numbing and I personally feel that this album may be the high point of RTF's output - although I do like all of their albums and could easily be swayed one way or the other.The musicians on Romantic Warrior include former Miles Davis keyboardist Chick Corea (acoustic piano, Fender Rhodes electric piano, Hohner clavinet, Mini-moog, Moog 15, micro mini-moog, ARP Odyssey, Yamaha organ, Polymoog, marimba, and percussion); the fastest bass player on Earth, Stanley Clarke (Alembic bass w/flanger, piccolo bass, acoustic bass, bell tree, and hand bells); shredder Al DiMeola (electric/acoustic guitars, soprano guitar, hand bell, and slide whistle); and the thunderous Lenny White (drums/percussion).The six tracks range in length from 5'01"" to 11'26"", with another track reaching 10'52"". The longer pieces consist of excellent ensemble work interspersed with incredible solos. Fortunately the solos do not go on for too long - then again these guys are top shelf and I could listen to Al DiMeola play scales at light speed all day long. In general though, the music is an interesting blend of prog, some classical, straight jazz and jazz rock, with loads of synthesizers (that sometimes get incredibly spacey) and some searing and occasionally heavily distorted guitar playing (Al DiMeola's track Majestic Dance amply demonstrates this). I think that it is interesting that the album liner notes point out that Chick's ""flights from his multi-keyboard post, more than took care of the Yes/King Crimson art rock flank"". As a prog fan I definitely agree and was more than wowed by Chick's playing. In addition to the rock elements, of which there are a lot, there are some shorter moments where things get slightly jazzy and Chick's acoustic piano and Stanleys' acoustic bass work can be heard (The Romantic Warrior). For the most part though, these moments are far and few between and this is pretty much a rock record. This remastered album is OK and features good sound quality and restored album cover art, with some informative liner notes.As a fan of both prog and jazz rock, this album works for me on a number of levels. I suppose though, that the blinding virtuosity may turn some folks off (along with the fleeting silly bits), although I can say that they do back off here and there so it is not completely insane. Highly recommended to prog fans and fans of jazz rock",0,1,0
"The single that launched the Downward Spiral, once you start down the dark path, no turning back. March of the Pigs is the opener to a five track single. Starts with an awesome drum intro, kicks in with bass and mayhem. Reptilian, track two is a remix of TDS's Reptile. Great riveting, gut wrenchin' sounds and bass. All The Pigs, All Lined Up, MOTP remix, at almost 8 minutes, it's the clashing of the pigs, almost slaughter-like, parts of this song will usually find it's way into the MOTP song on stage and in concerts. A violet fluid is the shortest track on this disc but it hits the heart, whether it's a remix of 'Pigs' or 'Reptile', or it's its' own piece of music, fits the realm nicely. Underneath the Skin is yet another remix of Reptile, with more rivetting and wrenching scratches, beats and piledriving sounds. Hard hitting from tracks one to five.

"This weekend (1/20/07) I was hankering for a new infusion of great electric blues, to add to my extensive collection. I went to my local CD/book store (name withheld to protect amazon.com) and was amazed to find, that their tiny, blues section, was even tinier! It didn't even have the cardboard blues sign up anymore. There weren't even any monthly new release CD's displayed. So as I truly got the blues, I just, as a last ditch effort, started thumbing through, every CD, at ""WARP"" speed, with one foot almost out the door. Like a sign from heaven, I noticed a multi-colored CD cover with, Otis Rush on it. I gulped, and silently said to myself, ""I haven't seen this before!"" and since half the head sets, at the un-named retail location, were broken in half, and the other half didn't work, (and the ones broken in half, one half ear set, didn't work) I took a chance and bought this CD without hearing nary a note! I zoomed home and put it in my stereo. Now, if you're one of Shaq's loyal blues review readers, you know the first thing you're worried about on a live CD, (The release date on the CD was 2006, and yet I never heard of it. The concert was December18, 1999, a date you could not find out, unless you bought the CD and opened it!) Is the sound quality? (See prior Shaq reviews!) Well, the sound was loud and crystal clear! The second thing, Shaq is worried about, is ""YOU CAN'T GET THE BLUES IN 2-3 MINUTES!"" Well, there are 7 songs with a total playing time of 52 minutes! Hoo! Haa! Every single song on this is great. The music, the voice, the feeling with the crowd! Whoever released this CD below the radar should be fired! This CD is an instant electric blues classic! I am told by amazon.com that I am the first person to review this! If that's the case, this review should break the record for the most ""THIS REVIEW WAS HELPFUL!"" votes! I have played it twice already, all the way through, to make sure I wasn't dreaming! I'm not. In fact as I wrote this review I pinched myself. Ouch! I have already called a blues-friend of mine, and said go buy this. You should too! SUMMARY: IT'S LOUD! IT'S CLEAR! IT'S LIVE! THE GUITAR STRINGS ARE BENDING! AND THE VOICE IS CLEAR!

"1978 was a pretty good year for rock and roll with prog reaching it's zenith and a slew of good post punk acts coming up through the ranks and old horses like ELO, The Eagles and Fleetwood Mac still at their creative peak, but Rafferty's ""City to City"" outshined them all. This effort fits like a old pair of sneakers, comfortable and perfectly molded to your feet. No new ground is broken here, no new sounds to push the envelope of rock, just one of the finest collections of songs ever assembled by one guy. Once you get past the hits ""home and Dry"", ""Baker Street"" (one of the best songs ever), and ""right down the line"" there's still much more to consider...The Title track, ""Mattie's Rag"", and ""whatever's written in your heart"" are all just as good as the hits, but it still doesn't end there...the rest are equally sublime. This album was all over the radio in the summer of 1978, I remember it like it was yesterday, but alas I was 11 and paid little attention (Baker Street is a bit much for an 11-year-old to comprehend) I ""discovered"" this gem in the summer of 1989 and spent many a peaceful evenings down by the lake soaking up these tunes. The album truly made a mark in my life. IMO it's the best album of the 1970s and a top 3 album of any era. This coming from a hard-rock junkie. Go figure.",0,1,1.9816409336183747e-41

"WARNING: The album version of ""Maneater"" meanders and stalls-out after less than 3 minutes (at what I would consider the song's climax), descending into over a minute and a half of nearly a cappella vocals, instrumental breakdowns, and ad-libs by Timbaland; the track concludes with several seconds of studio dialog. ""Loose"" is another frustrating example of an album that does not include the same version of the song heard on the radio or in the video.LOOSE consists of 13 songs, two of which are versions of ""Te Busque"". Most of the songs are produced by Timbaland. Booklet does not include lyrics. The album is listen-able, and while the percussion-based ""No Hay Igual"" is interesting, other than the poorly edited ""Maneater"" and the over-played ""Promiscuous"", there are no stand-out tracks.",0,1,1.600667865793941e-70

"After having listened to this Album several hundred times. I can say that of all the ""Music inspired by LOTR"" this one is the most satisfying. I am a fan of period style, Early instrumentation and arrangement so this makes me biased toward this album as many of the other albums out there sound far too Orchestral and Modern or Gawd awful New Agey to my ears. (The exception being ""Music Inspired by LOTR"" by Bo Hannson in the Seventies with its dated synth and organ sounds..but that's a Nostalgia pick as I heard that album when I was what, 12?) Some people have called it Rennaisance like but the sound is definitely earlier than that. As has been pointed out in other reviews the album's credits are misleading as Jon Anderson only sings on four songs and this is definatley an Ensemble work with alot of the credit going to Carvin Knowles who handles a good portion of the instrumentation and writing credits. It is closer in spirit to Mediaeval Baebes than anything else (Would be nice to see a Baebes LOTR album), though comparisons to other Irish/Gaelic music abound and are appropriate.Most of the Songs are very good to excellent and I recommend listening in order as I believe this sets the mood. (though I like waking up to Tir Im and Orome). Beware the Wolf and Orome: Lord of the Hunt come to mind. 2 songs that while diffrent in staly share theme and are vry complimentary. Beware the Wolf also has quite abit of energy and Draws you in. You really get the the feeling the you are preparing to face down Carcharoth and recover the Silmaril.The Best songs (IMHO) are the ones sung in ""Elvish"" performed by both John Anderson and the Female Lead Caitlin Elisabeth. Totally believable and other-worldly. I am however on the Fence with one tune; The Battle of Evermore cover. Its a little too Goth-y (and I like Goth-y)and would not sound out of place on an Eighties 4AD Album like Dead can Dance or This mortal Coil. I was not fond of it at first but it grew on me. (I like the use of the Female Chourus in Counter to the Dreary male lead). However, another Tune sung in Elvish by either Jon Or Caitlin would might have been better. Another nice fact about the album is the way that the songs seem to cover the span of Tolkiens works with more emphasis on the Silmarillion than LOTR itself.

All eight band members are playing very well together, just like in the early Airplane, and ""Sweeter Than Honey"" and ""I Want To See Another World"", along with ""Fast Buck Freddie"", are three of the best rockers the band ever recorded.

"DRG has reissued the 1964 Capitol recording of Kismet--and without apology. For fans of Gordon MacRae and Dorothy Kirsten, this may be cause for some rejoicing, but all others should beware. MacRae is all butch and blustery, and Kirsten sounds as if she is all too eager to return to the Metropolitan Opera. As MacRae combines the roles of the Hajj and the Caliph, and there is no one singing the Wazir, and the best music in the show, the quartet ""And This is My Beloved,"" becomes a decidedly peculiar duet. The role of the sexpot wife of the Wazir, Lalume, is sung by a serviceable lady with the singular name of Bunny Bishop, conjuring images of a high-church cleric with astoundingly large ears. There are at least four other Kismet recordings, the London studio cast with Valerie Masterson, a recent American studio recording with Samuel Ramey and Julia Migenes, the lamentable Vincente Minneli movie version starring Howard Keel, Ann Blyth, and Vic Damone, and, of course, the original Broadway cast album. The MacRae-Kirsten recording is arguably the worst, but the problem here really is that the original cast recording is so much better than any of the others that one has to wonder why they even bothered. Alfred Drake is stunning as the poet Hajj, Doretta Morrow heartbreakingly beautiful as his daughter Marsinah, a youthful Richard Kiley sings the bejesus out of the Caliph and, as Lalume, the treasured Joan Diener--who only recently left us to go sing with the angels--blows roof off with her several numbers.The MacRae-Kirsten recording cuts the score down to 10 numbers running just over 50 minutes, and the voices and general production values have a slapdash feeling that pales in comparison to the lush, sexy, funny and entirely satisfying original cast. For ardent fans of either of the singers, this is a chance to hear them at their prime, but all others would be wise to avoid this Kismet",0,1,5.479152544810568e-24

"Since everything I've ever heard Lee Lessack do is too marvelous for words, this CD is very aptly named. And when you're talking about a tribute CD to Johnny Mercer, how CAN you go wrong? This CD is a great combination of better- and lesser-known songs by Johnny Mercer, and really shows what a versatile songsmith he was. But an even bigger selling point for me is that the CD is recorded live, so you get to find out more about the artist performing -- and Lee Lessack is a very charming, witty, SUPER talented performer. I think he's got to be the best male voice in cabaret, and one of my favorite male voices in any genre. His version of ""When October Goes"" (featured on both this recording and ""I Know You By Heart"") is heartbreaking and in my opinion, the definitive version.

"This CD compiles the first two Raspberries LPs IN THEIR ENTIRETY. This is a much better option than any &quot;Best Of&quot; compilation, because many of the bands real gems were not singles and are never anthologized....If you are casually familiar with this band, you will be pleasantly blown away after hearing these first two albums. Nearly every song is fantastic. Eric Carmen &amp; Wally Bryson (check out his previous band, THE CHOIR) were Beatles and Brian Wilson worshippers at a time when this was not fashionable. Their prescient knowledge of and admiration for (at the time) commercial failures like &quot;pet sounds&quot; and the entire Left Banke catalog is obvious, and impressive. This band had a self-conscious, Romanticized, self-mythologizing concept of Pop music as a holy grail, similar to Brian Wilson's idea of &quot;Teenage Symphonies to God&quot;. In my opinion the high point of this compilation is Carmen's epic &quot;I Can Remember&quot;. (Beach Boys fans, note his not-so-subtle but delightful theft of part of the melody from the little-known Beach Boys song &quot;She Knows Me Too Well&quot;.) If you like Emmitt Rhodes, Badfinger, The Left Banke, etc, this is a great CD, get this rather than a &quot;Best Of&quot; compilation",0,1,8.269490598848541e-33
"The first time I recall Jerry singing a song was ""American Cheese"" which I believe was from the King's X album ""Ear Candy"". As a long-time, devoted fan of King's X, I've been interested in dUg and Ty's solo and project work over the last several years because, as you listen to their individual work, you begin to get a clear picture of what it is that each member of the King's X trio brings to the table musically and creatively. But until now, you had to kind of guess what it is (other than supreme talent on the drums) that Jerry Gaskill brings to King's X.Well, there's no need to guess anymore! With COME SOMEWHERE, the picture grows clearer as the final piece of the puzzle (Jerry's contribution) slips into place comfortably.Jerry is a natural and talented vocalist with a very Beatlesque style in the lead and harmony parts. The album is more diverse than I expected with some solid hard rock mixed with some very interesting and airy acoustic work. Jerry's colorful writing comes through very clearly and its easy to tie this work back into the fabric of King's X.I waited too long to buy this album but am very glad I did",0,1,8.269490598848541e-33
"Let me start by saying that after endless exposure to Karl Jenkins' most famous work (the ""A Diamond is Forever"" commercial theme), I doubted I'd ever like anything he wrote. I am glad to say I was mistaken.Jenkins' Requiem is without question a modern work, although its mold is probably a bit closer to that of Britten's War Requiem, or even Herbert Howells' ""Hymnus Paradisi"", than to other modern Requiems, such as those of Faur, Durufl, or Rutter. Jenkins' use of haikus in Japanese--and his intertwining of the haikus with the text near the end--add an extra dimension to the work, even though those movements have a substantially different sound than the rest of the work. Even the ""Dies Irae,"" with its unusual orchestration (I won't spoil the surprise), is a success.The fact that there are no well-known names here doesn't matter; the orchestral and choral sounds are both excellent. Better still, rather than making this the sole work on the CD, EMI adds ""In These Stones Horizons Sing,"" a work sung partly in Welsh, which rounds out this disc with more marvelous melodies, in particular, the ending of the third track, ""Gray"". [Please note that the track listing above is incorrect.]Fans of Jenkins' music will definitely want this disc.

"""John Lennon - Rock 'N' Roll"" . . . John Lennon had an ""electrically charged voice"" perfect for rock and roll . . . just like the hum and buzz of the amp of an electric guitar, John's voice surged and cut through with a magic that made his music more than memorable.Lennon recorded the songs he himself loved listening to before he was one of the four ""mop tops"". He rocks but he also delivers the slow heart moving ballad laments. My favorite tracks on this collection are ""Stand By Me"". . . ""Do You Wanna Dance"" . . . the ""Medley: Bring it On Home To Me/Send Me Some Lovin'"" . . . and my most favorite song on this album: ""Just Because"" (which John delivers along with some ""commentary"" alluding to his own nostalgia for this song - and probably all these songs-) Yoko Ono has added four bonus tracks by John which fit this album: ""Angel Baby"" . . . ""To Know Him Is To Love Him"" . . . ""Since My Baby Left Me"" and a Reprise of ""just Because"".This album is nostalgic . . .it evokes and provokes memories of the original versions of these songs and the memories of where and when we first heard them . . . i'm sure that this was exactly how it was for John Lennon himself as he selected the songs to be recorded and as he sang them in studio. You can ""hear"" the joy in his voice on more than one track of this collection. And though John is gone, he wil still bring that joy to your own experience of these songs.Thank you John Lennon for all of the great music you gave us throughout all of your years . . . and thank you for THIS album of what were ""oldies"" to you . . . and now are classics to us! :",0,1,6.65720901245652e-28
"As mentioned before the acoustic videos and interview are on the 10 track audio cd when you put in your computer (I couldn't get it to play in a regular DVD player). Also the ""June"" band dvd has about 10 music videos from many different bands. (Hawthorne Heights, Straylight Run, Silverstein, and some less mainstream known bands). I would list my favorite songs but I would have to list them all. I honestly think there is no filler on the disc. This band has been compared to Hawthorne Heights alot but I don't think they are very similar.

"RAM, Paul McCartney's second solo album (originally issued in 1971), comes closer to the Beatles ""sound"" than any other post-breakup work the four individual members produced. Many of the songs on RAM could easily have found a home on the White Album or ABBEY ROAD. For melodicism, inventiveness and style this one simply cannot be beat. What makes RAM superior to McCartney's first solo effort is the inclusion of other musicians (and not just novice Linda, who got equal billing here). Although decent on guitar and only fair on drums, the future Sir Paul's true instrumental talents lay in his bass-playing, which shines brightly on this record. ""Monkberry Moon Delight"" for example, is driven by the bass line. ""Back Seat Of My Car"" is an overlooked gem. The gorgeous multi-layered vocals on ""Dear Boy,"" the playfulness of ""3 Legs"" and ""Smile Away,"" the top-ten-hit sound of ""Uncle Albert.."" and the biographical nature of ""Long Haired Lady"" and ""Too Many People"" are just a few reasons why RAM remains McCartney's best-ever solo work. Five huge stars for this one",0,1,3.708157327427712e-150
"Forest were a late 1960's folk three-piece made up of brothers Martin and Adrian Welham and Dez Allenby. By the time their 1970 debut album was released their sound was not able to be pidgeon-holed as they took influences from both the rock and folk world. The beautiful harmonies are what stand out on their self-titled debut with consistant songs and hauntingly beautiful lyrics. Their second and final album manages to better their accomplished debut. The production is better and the songs more diverse. Stand out tracks include the Bluesy 'Do not walk in the rain', the beautiful 'Graveyard', an exquisite rendition of the traditional folk song 'famine song' and a song that still ranks up along side the greatest songs to come out of the underground hippie-folk era 'Autumn Childhood'. With all three band members accomplished singers, songwriters and musicians, the band compare favourably with most other bands of this ilk in the late 1960's. Well worth a place even in the most sparse of record collections",0,1,4.231743475484506e-52
"Firstly, I'd like to correct an earlier reviewer who said this album follows ""Argus"" as their third album. ""Pilgrimage"" is actually their second album. ""Argus"" being their third.Also, unlike what the same reviewer said about ""Argus"" and the first album being their best, Wishbone Ash continued to progress all the way up 'til 1980 with spectacular songs and guitarwork by Powell/Turner/Turner, and then later Powell/Turner/Wisefield. The reason I say only up until 1980 is because Martin Turner on bass and vocals left after that year, which IMHO, was a deadly blow to the band.When ""Pilgrimage"" was recorded, Andy Powell and Ted Turner were about 20 or 21 years old. That is just unbelievable. The song ""The Pilgrim"" is worth the price of admission alone and is one of the most adventurous compositions to ever be recorded. The remainder of the album is great as well. If you think rock has progressed in our day and age (2005) from what it was back in 1971, think again. This album comes from a time when musicians actually played rather than relying on some studio technology and amp-modeling technology over-sanitizing and sterilizing all the music that seems to be the norm today.And wow, you can actually hear the bass with definition on this album, unlike today's wall-of-mush bass that is so common",0,1,3.665082626446011e-45
"This is one of the best cd's I've heard in ages. What a fantastic and innovative group of songs! It's a totally different sound than anyone's come out with in a long time.

"This is a responsible review I hope unlike some others here Although Furay has done gospel CD's, this is not one. There is nothing openly ""religious"" on this record and it was targeted to a general market audience 100%. It seems some reviewers either did not listen to it or have a chip on their shoulder. If you don't like the music or lyrics, so be it. But, let's not attach false labels to this record for the sake of denigrating a great artist who is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.This record was crafted over a number of years.

"Sonny's mellow style of pop-country music did not impress everybody but he was hugely successful in his heyday, sometimes with covers of pop songs, although he also had some great original material.Young love is the song he is best known for despite having to compete head-on with Tab Hunter's version of the same song. Of the other original songs, You're the only world I know and True love's a blessing (both co-written by Sonny James) are particularly noteworthy. Sonny took several pop classics to (or close to) the top of the country charts including (on this collection) Running bear (Johnny Preston), I'll never find another you, World of our own (both Seekers), Born to be with you (Chordettes), Empty arms (Teresa Brewer), Only the lonely (Roy Orbison), Endlessly and It's just a matter of time (both Brook Benton).

"""Enough Rope"" continues the excellent work of this excellent artist. The set opens with the hot rocker ""Jack Blue"" with Kenny Greenberg's electric guitar stinging; and Dan Dugmore's pedal steel crying plaintively, ""You don't go looking for trouble. Ain't that what the old folks say? Don't go looking for trouble, it'll find you anyway."" This is followed in a 1-2 punch with the aching slow song ""Cry Lonely"" with Chris' vocal ringing with longing & regret, ""You always say your heart is breaking & you hear the wolf outside your door; But I know you're just using me 'til you don't need me anymore."" The wolf image is reflected in Wayne Brezinka's cover design. ""Saved by Love"" is another strong song that tugs on the heartstrings with Dan Dugmore's pedal steel aching. Dugmore is a longtime musical veteran from Linda Ronstadt & James Taylor's heyday to more recently Keith Urban & Lee Ann Womack. His touch throughout this set is masterful. ""Rural Route"" is a sweet country throwback to a more gentle time, ""I built a fire up on the hill; sat in the woods & drank my fill; Talked to God all night; Took another shot & set me right."" ""Dirt"" oozes anger with Knight letting the fur fly in his ripping vocals, ""Company came from out of state to build another stinking factory; Them county politicians think they know just exactly what we need; But I sit down by the highway. I hear those big Cats growl. Where the quail gonna fly? Where will the rabbits run now?"" ""Up from the Hill"" is another classic rocker with a churning guitar line that sounds like something from Day Tripper-era Beatles mixed in with backwoods pedal-to-the-metal rock, ""2 a.m. in the morning, he done pissed off all his friends; He'll come knocking on Vessie's door; She's the only one let him in."" ""Bridle On a Bull"" is another classic rocker that'd fit comfortably on a Johnny Cash record. Knight seems to continue the saga of ""William"" from his self-titled brilliant CD that appeared on Decca with ""William's Son"" with more on the guy raised without enough love. ""To Get Back Home"" is another burning rocker with Chris' voice ripping through mounds of emotion. The set ends with the slower tempo of the title track as Chris looks at a life that has a lot of blessings and a lot of dreams that may never come true. ""Enough Rope"" is a powerful CD. The musicianship is first-rate; and the set is paced well with a nod to the faster tempo. Chris Knight seems to embody the lonely guy persona, a man who wants to do the right thing but every now and then gets just a little ticked off. This CD has hugged my changer repeatedly. Bravo!",0,1,7.039638436074012e-150

"Bernard Herrmann and Alfred Hitchcock's collaborations are legendary. The two seemed to complement each other so well: Hitchcock's mastery at creating suspense combining with Herrmann's ferocious, mysterious and thrilling music immeasurably enhancing the experience. Vertigo is the pinnacle of their work together.The score is seductive, hypnotic and haunting. It brilliantly captures the essence of the character Scottie's (James Stewart) romantic, yet obsessive feelings for Madeleine (Kim Novak). The score deftly moves between the romantic and the suspenseful.The album starts off with the famous title music. Swirling strings and vibraphones creating a dream-like atmosphere that marries perfectly with the striking images of Saul Bass. After the titles conclude, a driving string ostinato punctuated with bursts of brass underscores a chase scene where Scottie first encounters vertigo. An amazing piece of music.Introduced in the third track is a Spanish-like motif that is used to signify Madeleine's connection to her ancestor Carlotta Valdez. The motif is repeated constantly creating an eerie and hypnotic effect on the listener.The love theme, featured throughout the score is heard fully in the outstanding 'Scene d'Amour' and is the highlight of the album. In just under six minutes, Herrmann builds and builds the emotion until the magnificent climax of the piece.Due to a musicians strike at the time of the film's music recording session, Bernard Herrmann did not actually conduct the score that exists in the film. Apparently Herrmann thought the conductor, Muir Mathieson did a sloppy job. Well this new recording by Joel McNeely is quite simply outstanding. The playing by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra is superb and the album features wonderful sound quality. This allows the listener to study the detail of Herrmann's unique orchestrations closer than that of the original recording.The album comes complete with extensive liner notes, featuring track by track analysis and a small biography on Herrmann.Vertigo is an outstanding score. An essential album for any film score collector",0,1,1.6076293090378484e-48
"From this huge box set, it is quite obvious that Bach was a dedicated composer for the organ (and obviously a virtuoso organist for that matter). Bach was a very prominent composer who lived in the Baroque era, and to truely understand his works and their style you must have a general outline of knowledge of the timeframe in which he lived. And so the Baroque era, (1600-1750) was characterized by vastness of proportion, rich counterpoint, great splendor and a highly ornamented melodic line. (One should note that the era abruptly ended after Bach's death which actually shows his importance in it) Some of these pieces are examples of works that require performers at the very highest degree to play them. His works go way beyond the famous Toccata and Fuge in D Minor, and with a &quot;Complete&quot; edition you can listen and hear them all for yourself, hence grasping the full view of his genious. This set is of wonderful value and worth every penny. Unfortunately, the Master's version is not available in a CD store, and so we must indulge upon other's interpretations. This out of the others stands as one of the very best. It is also complementing to the experience to have an instrument of the period (which is so in this set). Bach devoted his entire frame of mind towards the spreading of God's kingdom, therefore one could derive that he felt that by creating enlightening and insightful music, he was doing a lowly service to his God. Overall--this is a fabulous interpretation, and it will deepen one's respect and awe for Johann Sebastian Bach, the greatest organist who ever lived.",0,1,1.0244509257793477e-126
"This is a brilliant, beautiful, fun album that really makes Meyer's command of a complex and much under-appreciated instrument seem god given. In spite of the fact that there aren't any words the music on here stakes a claim for itself outside of just background music because it can be pretty edgy and raw at times. I like the combination of old folk tunes covered and Meyer's avant-garde double bass compositions, although this album's not for those looking for lots of covers of classical tunes",0,1,2.6254048436294377e-117
"My goodness, what a follow up. Very brave. Burnt is beautiful, probably my favorite.Favours for Favours is another favorite. Yes/No is a great indication of ""we're back""-ness with it's build-up to anthemic arcadefire-esque chanting. At first i was dissapointed with the choice single Skip to the End but with a few listens it really became great. not really the effect you want from a single though i suppose. Ross' singing gets to shine on this album. Back to the Sea is 'one damn song that could make me break down and cry.' it did actually make me cry when they played it live. i don't know why. it's just so beautiful i guess. i don't understand why they arn't as big, or bigger, than franz and block party or even arctic monkeys for that matter. i love these guys.

"I'm a college student, and I find that current pop music doesn't do it for me. In fact, most of my friends listen to music that dates from the 1960s to the early 90s. I love this CD, New Order is very easy to listen to and enjoy. You can even hear the foundations of modern day house music within some of the tracks. The melancholy tone of the lead singer is definitive of a lot of the pop in the 80s, yet he does not bore you. Although I do admit, you can tell that all the tracks have somewhat of a general way of being constructed; so I recommend listening to the 30 second snippets that Amazon provides to decided if you really want to buy it. However, if you want a CD that is somewhat definitive of 80s Brit Pop, and made a huge impact on the Pop scene, I would definitely recommend buying this. It's a great compilation of the music by New Order",0,1,2.468501638729601e-150
"After a very long break following the disappointing Distant Horizons, this new album represents a clear return to form for Hawkwind. Long term fans may be initially disconcerted by the wide musical breadth of the album, which includes influences as diverse as techno and jazz (the latter courtesy of new collaborators Jez Huggett and Jason Stuart), but this is still a Hawkwind album through and through. There's a very clear sense of purpose in this album- that this is just the launchpad for new journeys by the mothership, with strong songwriting and musicianship and a promise of much more to come.Highlights including the chilling ""To Love A Machine"" which features some fabulous guitarwork by Dave Brock (and, as throughout the album, powerful rhythm work by Chadwick and Davey). Angela Android, a kind of light-hearted sequel to the classic Spirit Of The Age, is an absolute blast of joyous space-rock, as is Sunray with Arthur Brown on vocals. Digital Nation, by (and sung by) Richard Chadwick, is a (nice) surprise- a low key and folk influenced ode to the joys of online gaming. And the last track, the controversial ""A Letter To Robert"" engages and challenges with a compelling monologue by Brown about the changing times, cramming in everything from changing gender roles to a theory that the holes on golf courses are made by extraterrestrial spacecraft!Hawkfans have waited a long time for a new Hawkwind studio album. It's finally arrived, and does not disappoint. Definitely an album that rewards repeated listening",0,1,1.3159534757955e-64

"The third disc of this amazing compilation is as close to seeing GP/Emmylou live as it gets. Fresh, unfettered,natural, intimate. Totally different versions and feelings from the antecedent CDs.""The New Soft Shoe"" with the spare, alto fiddle gives the song an even more evocative southern feel and brings the story to life. Return of the Grievous Angel is a front palor, rocking chair, lope along story. Totally different harmony line from Emmylou. Different phrasing from GP, adding a syllable to ""grievous"" and stretching out ""that ooold Bible belt"" in the verse about Elvis. Has there ever been a more heartfelt version of ""Hickory Wind"" and there are a lot of versions of that chestnut. The stunner is ""Love Hurts"". Much more passionate than any other version on record.

"Is it just me or does Miles have such a comprehensive conciousness that he actually is able to encircle reality/music/ideas/concepts and not just present them? I mean, listen to this album. The songs, like those on On the Corner, and Live/Evil etc. have a circular pattern. The sound envelopes you, blankets you in the mystery of the circle. You can drop into any point of any of these songs and your musical journey will end up where you started, no matter where you started. His music is a virtual washing machine of brilliant sound. On this album of course the sound is clothed in thick slabs of groove dripping with polyrythmn and funk guitar laced with Miles' shrieking runs of distorted wah wah trumpet. There are many interesting breaks in which the organic creation of pure hybrid music grows botanically into an evil plant of desire. This album is all about nihilistic desire for sexual gratification like when you are hung over and you are tense and Turned On with rancidity. There are bizzare twistings and turnings in the imagination of Miles and his band on this CD. But, unlike many of the other reviewers of this album here on Amazon, I dont get an exclusively ""dark"" feeling from this album. There isdarkness and there is also the sense of a child playing in his room alone with all kinds of instruments and tones and maybe even an easle and a bunch of paint in tubes. Miles is fingerpainting here, often fingerpainting his joy as well as his sorrow. Art does indeed reflect nature and at this time in his life Miles was using things that bring exstacy and sorrow both. He is as on during this concert as he ever has been, and he is as off during this concert as he ever has been. Circular...see",0,1,1.0060795067692368e-64

It shows a lot of early, leather-clad rock influence.BTW, I bought the club version, which is manufactured for BMG. I was worried about that a bit, but no longer.

"The one problem a record collector encounters when he has an album too many of one artist, is the tendency of the artist to sing the same songs in succeeding albums/settings. Feinstein, who I consider as the leading proponent in reviving the American Popular Song standards to its unfettered glory is backed by a philharmonic orchestra in this album with the musical direction of conductor Alan Broadbent. And yes, he sang some songs that were sung in sparse and acoustic settings in his previous albums. As usual, just like any cabaret singer who never really sings the same song twice (listen to the grand old dames of cabaret like Julie Wilson and Mabel Mercer), Feinstein delights in the varied ways he can see a song in different contexts. Having said that, I thought he was a bit overly cautious in exploring his rich bari-tenor (sorry for this oxymoron but that is the word to apply to his voice) in soaring the vocal lines of Kern's The Folks Who Live on the Hill. Other than that, he was at his wittiest and conversational (not to mention just plain beautiful) voice when singing I Won't Send Roses and he can revisit the Bernstein/Sondheim Somewhere without evoking the famous version of uber diva Barbra Streisand. If you like good crooning vocals in a grand and orchestral setting, this is the album to listen or give as a gift -- you/they won't regret it",0,1,6.957273951391562e-37

That means you get the same invarying power trio format, songs played at the same speed, same volume, in the same key, with Billie Joe whining away as usual. It's almost offensive Green Day scored such massive success with this format. Not that I mind fast, hard music at all - I love The Clash and Sex Pistols, after all. But here's why Green Day cannot logically be considered the next Clash or Sex Pistols: The Clash kept things interesting by working in reggae, even in the early days (I'm sure White Man in Hammersmith Palais would blow these guys' heads off), while The Sex Pistols weren't around long enough for their sound to get old - anyway, they mixed it with some of the best protest lyrics ever. Green Day didn't vary their formula much until Nimrod, where they landed easily their best song ever (the acoustic Good Riddance), and a couple tunes I hope never to hear again (Hitchin' a Ride, King for a Day) in the process of experimenting; and you can forget intelligent protest lyrics. It's all the usual bratty complaining. And guess what? Some of these songs are awful: Geek Stink Breath, Walking Contradiction and Brat are the main offenders.Now, believe it or not, this isn't a total loss, unlike Dookie. Brain Stew was overplayed as hell at the time (and isn't really any better now), but at least it has a cool riff, and the speedy Stuart & the Ave. actually generates some interest. And I like the cover art. But Green Day sucked until Warning, which I acutally like, and continued sucking after Warning - in other words, if you're looking for Green Day, avoid everything but that album. At least that's my opinion. If you like this group, hey, whatever.",0,1,8.420236531978965e-153

"This is a nice anthology of Renaissance music encompassing key composers of both the Prima and Seconda Prattica, including one or two less known names. The uniting theme is that of they are all in praise of the Virgin Mary. Most of these works are old war horses such as the Josquin Ave Maria which is beautifully performed. Their tempo for the Josquin is similar to that of the spacious approach of the Hilliard Ensemble, and unless you like this music performed at breakneck speed you will likely find this performance perfectly satisfying. If you are interested in an anthology of Renaissance music then this is a great choice, however for those of us with a strong interest in music of this period what really makes this essential listening is the two extraordinary pieces by Vasily Titov.Titov composed at the time of Tsar Peter the Great's modernisation drive in Russia. He brought in composers from the West and Titov's music represents a marriage of the Italian compositional styles of the Seconda Prattica with the traditions of the Russian Orthodox Church. Like the grand architecture of St Petersburgs, and the Hermitage this is an fascinating mixture of Western influences with distinctly Russian ones. The twelve part polychoral writings have some of the dark solemnity of Russian Orthodox music while clearly being heavily influenced by the likes of Monteverdi, Gabrielli, Lassus and Palestrina. Perhaps a more authentically Russian approach to this music would have given far more prominence to the basses, but this still has trumendous impact. It makes it strange that there is so much interest in composers such as Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Moussorsky, Shostakovich and the like but the Early Music movement have yet to catch up with Eastern Europe - Titov is very easily their equal and I would welcome more substantial recordings devoted to exploring this neglected composer. This is a great recording recommended both to a general audience as well as to lovers of Renaissance music alike. The recorded sound is natural and full bodied. You can pick out individual voices in the chorus without them being drowned into an amorphous porridge of sound - a sign of a good recording. Still, I have heard wider sound staging and a wider dynamic range, so for all its virtues this is almost - but not quite - audiophile quality. Clearly a SACD format DSD recording would have been preferable",0,1,4.0777548473064915e-37
"This is absolutely one of my favorite CD's in the entire world. First, let's talk about the differences between it and the Broadway CD. The Broadway recording contains two absolutely lovely songs, &quot;A Man Doesn't Know&quot; and &quot;Near To You&quot;, and also the hilarious &quot;The Game.&quot; These three were cut from the movie and replaced by &quot;There's Something About An Empty Chair&quot; (The only Damn Yankees song I cannot stand... it's just not fun nor pretty...). Otherwise, with a few changes in the length and phrasing of &quot;A Little Brains, A Little Talent&quot;, &quot;Whatever Lola Wants&quot;, and &quot;Who's Got The Pain&quot;... it's no different than the Broadway CD. However, I LIKE this CD more than the Broadway CD. I don't know why... the background music just sounds better to me over all, and Gwen Verdon actually SOUNDS like herself. Don't get me wrong, I own the Broadway CD also and I LOVE IT, but if you're debating, this is definitely the way to go (unless one of the cut songs is your favorite). After all, there's nothing like hearing the phrases &quot;Hallo Joe!&quot; and &quot;ERP!&quot; now is there? :o",0,1,0

"There are many Rosanne Cash collections out there. This one lives up to it's title though. The songs collected here are truly some of the best from Rosanne's albums. Although most of the songs on here were hits there are a few that recieved little to no airplay. Her #1 country singles are included as well as one previously unreleased track. That track, ""Never Be You"" was originally recorded in 1983 for the ""Streets Of Fire"" soundtrack. For whatever reason Rosanne's version wasn't included on the soundtrack, instead Maria McKee's take on the Tom Petty song was. Rosanne would later redo the song for her ""Rhythm & Romance"" album in 1985. The original version, produced by Rodney Crowell and Jimmy Iovine lacks the punch of her later remake, but is a gem nonetheless. Just about each of Rosanne's albums from 1979 thru 2003 are represented here. Only 1982's ""Somewhere In The Stars"" is overlooked. Too bad too, ""Ain't No Money"" was the hit from that album but perhaps because it's sounds too much like ""Seven Year Ache"" it's not thought of as her best? In a sense ""Very Best Of"" replaces her earlier ""Greatest Hits"" disc, in some ways it's a nice companion to it. If you're new to the music of Rosanne Cash, this album is a good place to start. If you find you do like this album, you'll want to explore the other albums in her catalog. For the most part, Rosanne's albums are much like Emmylou Harris's in that there really isn't a weak one in the bunch",0,1,3.8643485337448724e-82
"Mr. Khekoyan, who reviews this disk below, is quite correct that it is errant in tempi and in percussive interpretation. I'm not in agreement with him about Glenn Gould's stature as the foremost interpreter of Bach of the century. I'd suggest listening to the performance of Menno van Delft, which is included in the Bach Edition complete works produced by Brilliant Classics. There are any number of people who might nominate Gustav Leonhardt, Trevor Pinnock, or Bob van Asperen as more insightful interpreters of Bach than Glenn Gould. Don't let Gould's curious cult status mislead you; his performances are more quirky than competent.Or, if you are attracted to the Art of Fugue rather than the Artist, you might listen to the performance of the Amsterdam Loeki Stardust Quartet, also available on CD. Though there is no historical justification for playing Bach's harpsichord music on recorders, the LSQ makes fine and insightful music on their wooden flutes, large and small. At times they sound more organistic than Mr. Gould on his modern behemoth",0,1,1.7387346415860757e-144

"The Stimmen symphony is one of the great peaks of Gubaidulina's career, a looping, moody work centered around a D major triad and then slowly metamorphoses in and out of itself, moving into an inexplicable transcendence.

"I was required to purchase this with my new computer. I thought I'd give it a chance at work. We have a dedicated wired network, which just requires that you register the machine's MAC address with our DHCP server. Nice and simple, and very much like the LAN in any home where the user has a NAT router.I plugged in the network and tried to get the MAC address. Vista would only give me the wizard to connect my network. OK, I tried the wizard. It offers to let me setup PPPoE with a username and password. That's it, no other options. I asked for other options, and it only offered that I use a modem (that I did not have in my computer.) No options for a dedicated network at all, that I could find.I went to another machine (on the 'net) and searched Google. None of the Microsoft sites were helpful in any way. Lots of PR posturing, but no useful information or troubleshooting.I gave up, found the license and install disks for Windows XP, and downgraded the new machine.

"I purchased a power-pro in 1995, began working with it consistently in 2001 and felt / saw immediate results. I outgrew the 210 level last year and found they'd stopped upgrading bows for the old machine. It cost less than $100 per year, but I was indignant - mostly because I had used it as an expensive clothes hanger for half a decade.With the XTLU2 I've lowered resistance because the bows are new and stiffer. I've also used the lat tower and leg attachment past the point of 'gosh, this is fun' to where I feel a nice ache if I neglect those exercises. I am upgrading the bows now so they'll be ready when I am.I'm trying to decide what to do with the old machine. They say there were recalls, but I didn't experience any problems. I can't sell it without the improvements and I shouldn't give it to the Goodwill if there's a danger. I need to make friends with fat people who just want to try the machine out. Actually, this is a pretty cool problem to have at this point.Oh, the machine is silent so you can work out whenever you have time.

"I love Cathe Friedrich's workouts. She's energetic and encouraging, but not too much so (think Denise Austin...I just can't take that level of perky). Plus, her workouts don't pull any punches--they're designed to challenge you and push you to challenge yourself.I regularly do several other of Cathe Friedrich's workouts (Muscle Endurance, Pyramid Upper & Lower Body, Supersets). I love them all for variety, but I think Muscle Max is my favorite. It is 68 minutes of a complete workout--upper body, lower body, and core, with barbell, dumbells, and resistance band. You get it all. (You don't need a barbell, however. All exercises can be done with dumbells alone.)Better yet, you can choose what you want to do. The DVD comes with ""Premixed"" workouts loaded. If you don't have time for the 68-minute full workout, you can do the 42-minute upper body, the 23-minute lower body, or the 53-minute ""time saver."" OR you can go to a ""Mix & Match"" section to choose your own specific exercises from the entire DVD.The ""Mix and Match"" section has its drawbacks--it takes a while for the DVD to switch out of the program, into the menu, and back into a program, which makes this the most inconvenient of the options. However, it's great if you want to match up one of the premixed workouts with the core workout, or if you just have time for one small group of exercises (say, triceps.)I LOVE this DVD. It is the most comprehensive and flexible strength training workout I've ever done, and I've done a bunch, including many from The Firm series. I highly recommend this one.",0,1,2.468501638729601e-150

"Though the product says the blocks are suitable for babies as young as 6-months, keep in mind they are talking about how safe they are! Not necessarily that the kid will like them that early!

Even when she was old enough to hold and examine them, I think I found them more interesting than she!BUT... after putting the blocks out of sight for a while, then pulling them back out, she's much more in love with them! Remember that kids develop at different stages, not to mention, they are little humans and simply have different tastes and interests! My advice: don't write these blocks off as not very good simply because your child doesn't like them. Start with one small set and (re)introduce it to your child at intervals.

We tried the mac and cheese too, it takes 15 minutes to cook and again says 4 pack, but that's only 2 pastas and 2 cheeses. Very expensive, hardly any food, and pretty nasty to eat.

"I reluctantly gave this superb film 5 stars not because of any shortcomings in the script or the acting-both are unbelievebly good-but because of what the studio had done to the movie. It was originally released at over 3 hours in lenght. When exhibitors demanded that it be shortened Warner's obliged by cutting it to 154 minutes. In the early 1980s the studio realized what it really had, and set about reconstructing and restoring the movie. Because of initial sloppiness (footage being thrown out), it became impossible to fully reconstruct the film. The result is that there is a segment of some 7 minutes of stills about one hour into the picture trying to restore some of the lost scenes. Gone, too, apparently. is Vicki Lester's screen test.All of this aside, what the viewer sees on the 1999 digitally restored DVD is superb. The color correction of the nearly 20 minutes it was possible to restore is excellent. The actors' performances are outstanding. Not only is Garland a superb singer and dancer,but the close intimate scenes with Mason radiate a warmth and tenderness rarely captured on film. Mason, too, is superb as Norman Maine. When drunk, his character is absolutely dispicable-becoming phisical and violent. Great, too, is the supporting cast.Jack Carson as the studio publicist Libby plays the role with much more profesionalialism and less corniness than his counterpart Lionel Streater did in 1937.This is, by far, the best version of the film and well worth owning and viewing- dispite the minor shortcomings of its reconstruction.There is not one corny word of dialog in the Moss Hart script",0,1,4.466760793346692e-36

"Excellent glimpse into one of the most important and integral news agencies of the decade. IF you can watch it with the ""walk a mile in my moccasins"" attitude, it is a fascinating and disturbing look at how the ""2/3 world"" sees the United States of America",0,1,3.626543700540905e-41

"I saw this in an extension film class at UCI, and James Gray talked to the class after it was shown. This being a dark movie, it was slightly surprising that he was very light-hearted, and witty, and good-humored. I thought the movie first rate. It is intelligent and well-written and well-directed. The only flaw I found in it is there is a scene where a bullet is shot through a hanging sheet. The camera pans to the hole in the sheet to show the dead body on the other side. Well, for the hole to accomodate the camera, it had to be as wide as a hole a baseball would go through. A bullet would never make a hole that big! So that marred the movie slightly. But other than that, I liked it a lot. It is dark, and a lot of people in the class didn't like it because of that. But if you like dark, check this out",0,1,1.146707475976378e-139
"Poltergeist the legacy has nothing to do with those dumb poltergeistmovies. It's a terific show all on it's own. There are about 100+websites created by the fans alone. There are close to a million fanfics posted online. The cast has great chemistry and the special effects are TERRIFIC! There's curently a petition at Helen's site to bring the show back. :) &quot;Since the begining of time, mankind has existed between the world of light and the world of darkness&quot",0,1,6.957273951391562e-37
"I hope you are luckier than me in receiving a Criterion DVD that doesn't stall and skip like the one Amazon sold me. The price is pretty high to get a shabby DVD. The movie, of course, is terrific: well written, funny, compelling. Too bad after Chapter 13 (""Xmas Eve Day"") the DVD itself falls apart.",0,1,1.2438072116217267e-76
"I actually really liked this movie, I thought it was fun, fairly intelligent, sexy, humorous, quite suspenseful and the special effects were pretty good too.Okay so I am a fan of Angela Bassett and James Spader, and they were pretty hot in this movie you have to admit! Angela plays Dr Kaela Evers the ship's medical officer and James is the ship's hunky co-pilot Nick Vanzant who has a lustful eye on Kaela who isn't that interested in him much to his disappointment.The action takes place on medical spaceship and were an alien artefact is secreted aboard by a miner the aforesaid medical spaceship and its crew rescue who unbeknown to them is slowly mutating into something not quite human courtesy of the alien artefact. There is also a ship's computer called Sweetie with a female persona who is pretty much running the show from a technology point of view and a star that is about to go supernova.One by one the crew are picked off by the demented miner, who has mayhem on his mind, and soon only Spader and Bassett are left on the ship which is in danger of being sucked into the gravitational field of the crumbling star and there is only one life pod left and to share it means the possibility of Kaela and Nick's DNA merging together which it does partially, in that they both end up with one blue and one green eye but miracle of miracle's Kaela also ends up pregnant, a condition she never expected to be in!All in all it is a pretty good sci-fi film, shame it was panned so much because it is well worth watching but I have noticed over the years I have been reviewing films that the more intelligent the sci-fi film on offer, the less likely it is appreciated by the ""green slime and mega-blood and guts"" brigade as I call them. You know who you are guys, if it isn't gung ho with no plot then you don't want to know!Watch this film and enjoy, that is if you have a brain in your head that appreciates something that comes under, ""intelligent"" and ""thoughtful"", however if this is too much for your brain cells, give it a miss and watch something easier like Star Wars or Men in Black, great films that are lots of fun but totally lacking in anything remotely intelligent from beginning to end",0,1,4.626505598718178e-41
"Take a chance on this well made film that is simply enjoyable to watch. Rob Morrow in particular is amazing and you can't afford to miss watching this film. All TV films should be as good. Also take the time to see Rough Riders, Truman, and Conspiracy",0,1,2.407827531879929e-68
"This 1957 masterpiece launched Ingmar Bergman from a provincial writer-director into well-deserved international fame. His actors, particularly Max von Sydow, accompanied him on his journey of fame and choreographing thought-provoking films that challenge current notions of the meaning of life - what role does religion play (to terrorize its believers) - what is truth - and what lies beyond the grave.Flawless cinematography, lighting, dappled faces are hallmarks of the Bergman landscape. He seems to grab the viewer by the collar and pull us onto the screen, forcing us to experience the horrors of medieval Europe, including the fruitless two-century long Crusades and the fear engendered by the Black Plague that swept through Europe.Scapegoats, terror and cruelty were used by the Church to counteract any sort of threat or fear, whether to the Church's sacred word or the uncontrollable plague that killed off a third of Europe. People behaved like puppets, unlike our two heroes - the Knight and his Squire - who conclude we must create our own meaning and our own moral code.Memorable scenes include von Sydow playing Chess with Death. He manages to cheat death for a few hours, in which he accomplishes what he failed to do during his wholly unenlightened, morally degrading 10-year-battle in the Crusades: He saves a married couple and their child from certain death - and importantly - questions a naive young girl, a so-called witch, to discover if she knows the secrets of life, the Knight's ultimate crusade. The simple girl, brainwashed by immoral clergy, believes herself to be a witch who of necessity will burn - painlessly - for her sins. Von Sydow in an act of mercy gives her a potion that will erase the certain anguish of her death.Von Sydow's temporary reprieve from death allows him to find - in only several hours - the life of meaning that failed him for 40 years. Excellent film commentary accompanying the DVD tells us that the famous penultimate scene of von Sydow and friends being led across the silhouetted landscape by the scythe-bearing Grim Reaper was just an afterthought by Bergman, just a happy or dreary accident, like life itself. This movie masterpiece must be seen by those willing to confront life's eternal verities",0,1,1.8036793679605572e-78
"Few films carry an all Female cast that was so strong in it's acting, and making you believe that what was happening actually unfolds as you watch, of course the making of, just blew me away with how real and cleverly the movie came together.I would have like to have seen an expansion of the characters involvement between the end 2 female characters and a related male character who we see at the start, but only get an inkling as too their possible involvement to possibly each other....you have to be quick...10/10 all up, and I Highly recommend it.Le",0,1,1.5411412950106242e-42

"A brilliant, but sad movie about the effects of AIDS, both to the patient, and to the family and friends. Eric Roberts, Gregory Harrison, and the rest of the all-star cast were phenomenal. For those who have lost loved ones and friends to this horrific disease, you will definitely be moved to the point of tears, then laughter, then tears again. I thought this was definitely Oscar material. It is right up there with ""Philadelphia"" in my book",0,1,2.8740492967663704e-74
"I haven't seen any other of Arthur Penn's films, but I enjoyed this one as a start. The script is great, as is the acting, epecially Marlon Brando's turn as the eccentric ""Regulator"" Robert E. Lee Clayton. Jack Nicholson is also pretty good. If you're a fan of westerns, the stars, or even just damn good movies, check this film out",0,1,4.534578474603637e-92
"Scary Movie is an instant movie classic.Director Keenan Ivory Wayans outdies himself in a spoof of horror films involving an innocent teenager named Cindy Campbell who's being stalked by a goofy killer in a cheap rendition of Scream.Though funny to watch,Scary Movie also has it's share of gross-out gags and laughs.The way Wayans slanders horror films is so funny that you can't help but laugh out loud",0,1,2.440603046740848e-36

"I finally bought this movie! Everytime it would air on TCM my 15 yr old daughter and I watched. It's not a scary movie, rather fascinating to see actual freaks of nature, not hollywood actors dressed in prosthetics and makeup. Prince Randian rocks. No arms or legs yet he rolls his own cigarettes, strikes a match, lights up and smokes. WOW! Have you ever seen a real pinhead! Not the freak with pins sticking out of his face, but a real pinhead. This movie has 3.",0,1,1.4327018792045713e-30
"Lover's Lane....another no brainer slasher movie straight to video and its really horrible. Lover's Lane is the hot spot to where you wanna go to make out but 15 years ago some people were murdered up at that joint and 15 years later, some relatives of the people who were murdered up there (always is) Are tormented in the present but the ""Hook Man"" from the Urban Legend. Pretty much a snoozer with bad acting (who calls this acting good?). How many screaming teenaged girls have we seen in movies? It only works if the movie is good and this is not a good movie. The plot twists and turns arent even that great....idiotic writing. Starring: Riley Smith (Radio, 8 Legged Freaks), Erin J. Dean (Lolita, A Pig's Tale), Suzanne Bouchard (Joyful Partaking), Sarah Lancaster (Four Kings, Dr. Vegas), Diedre Kilgore (Good Luck, The Falls), Billy O'Sullivan (A Change Of Heart, Rites), Matt Reidy (Hit and Run, Carried Away) and Anna Faris (Scary Movie 1-4, Just Friends) in one of her earlier movies. Nothing can save this from being thrown over a cliff....it's ridiculous",0,1,2.1290426432452416e-56
