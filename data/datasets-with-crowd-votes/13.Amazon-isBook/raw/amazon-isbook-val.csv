My 6 yr old grandchild listens to it over and over,1
"Like the bloke below, I read this book for school, but for the purposes of ancint history.  Yes, indeed, Marcus Tullius Cicero is the most outstanding life Plutarch saw fit to write of.  For an aspiring lawyer like myself,  Cicero embodies desireable traits and wit (although I wouldn't repeat his  joke about the Sphinx being in one witness' house!).   Penguin's edition  features: Marius, the dictator Sulla, Pompey, Crassus, and, of course,  Caesar.  These men are all fascinating by themselves, but the men of the  triumverate stand head and shoulders above the rest.  The first such  &quot;triarch&quot; was Pompey.  The contemporary reader will find some  amusement and eyebrow raising pleasure at the lively sex lives of these two  men.  Pompey bit his lovers, while Crassus lived every single man's dream:  in a cave with two slave girls.   What Plutarch sets out to accomplish is  to display these men as models--how the lust for ultimate and absolute  power was the undoing of each man.  And I'm not being ironic; all these men  were destroyed by the enemies they created, the wars they spawned, or pride  they chained themselves to",1
"I can't believe they actually made this into a movie.  What crap!Okay, I bought this just to see what the fuss was about.  Stories of a guy getting doped up and drunk is not entertaining.  Maybe because I've been around enough drunks and druggies growing up that I fail to see the humor.  The fact that he was allowed to write books and have them published is shocking.  Thompson was laughing all the way to the bank, or drug dealer, in his case.  I've seen people do drugs to write better songs or paint better paintings, but to do drugs and then write about doing drugs, geez where's the talent in that?  His talent was actually living to write about his trips and then getting some publishing house to give him money for writting his stories.I believe people read it because of one of two reasons: 1) Like me, curious about why everyone finds him so interesting and talented; or 2) To experience what it is like to be drugged out without taking the actual drugs",1
"Morgan Heritage has come ""FULL CIRCLE'on this cd. They have proved how verstile they can be without losing their roots. The Heritage family lay it down something lovely with fabulous vocals arrangements. Gramps shows off his wonderful sexy vocals on the song ""I'm coming home"". My personal favorite is ""Your Best Friend"" and judging by their fans reactions at last nights Brooklyn concert it seems ""Your Best Friend"" is on its way to the number one spot! ""Propaganda"" and ""Jah Comes First"" are also great songs with meaning full messages.Don't sleep on this one people, there is something for Reggae and R&B fans alike.Rastafari",0
"This movie added a world war, changed the continent the story took place on, and then brought the dead back to life. To me, once the essential elements of the author's story are that fundamentally altered, it's not fair to use the title anymore. I realize a number of the changes are a 'tribute' to the Shirley Temple version, but I'd hoped that since the new version wasn't a star vehicle they might have returned to more of the original storyline, but no. At least the first movie was on the correct continent! I like the movie, believe it or not, but it's not the story I read until the first book fell apart, and the changes to the story I listed weren't necessary, and it may have been nice to see that things can work out even when a parent stays dead",0
"I am a childrens literature bibliophile.  PLAY WITH ME by Marie Hall Ets is at the top of my list.  As a Christa McAuliffe Fellow, WONDER WINDOWS is my fellowship title. The WONDER WINDOWS project integrates wonderful children's literature with science and nature.  This book make a delightful introduction",1
"For a nice, logical and thorough study of Biochem for the Medical student I have found no better book. Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews are extensive withought being preoccupied with the unnecessary details, can serve as a review or as a stand alone book, and yet it is in no way oversimplified. It would be an important constituent of the medical student library",1
"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp is one of the best films made by the Powell & Pressburger team. It is the best British film of the mid 1940's that I have seen. It is filmed in color and is stunning.It is inspired by the British comic strip, Colonel Blimp written by David Low.The film covers the life of a British soldier, Clive Candy, played by the great actor Roger Livesey, best known for his voice, who has been other Powell & Pressburger films. It starts around the turn of the century during the war in South Africa. When he spends time in Germany, he befriends a soldier while in a hospital. The film covers the two world wars and a reunion of th two soldiers.The film has very fine acting and has a great cast. The DVD is loaded with very good special features.There is audio commentary which was made in 1988 for the laserdisc version. the commentary is by co-director Michael Powell and Martin Scorsese, who is a big fan of the P&P films. Three are behind the scenes photos, a slideshow of original Colonel Blimp cartoons, and a 24 minute special about the film.This is a must-see film",0
"Imagine playing a high stakes poker game with a very special deck. You are dealt cards picturing the following places: (A) corporate headquarters, (K) flea market, (Q) megachurch, (J) paramilitary group and (J) power broker's club. Only one card marks the soul of America but only the dealer knows which one. Ante up. Abraham King's new novel, The Soul of America from Savannah's Seedtime Press takes place at all those locations. Faces populate each location, like cards in a promising poker hand. The ideas found in the locations are the real characters that King develops. They are born, grow, use resources and compete with each other. They can be stimulating, exciting, compelling, consuming, cutthroat, vicious, domineering and vengeful. Readers will recognize them easily. We live among them every day. Sometimes, they define who we are and sometimes, they consume us. Always, they affect our lives and the less we are aware of them, the more treacherous the effect. Aware or not, we are the purveyors of the ideas that King characterizes. If we are to get control over the meanings of our lives, however, we must first understand the priorities we have accepted. Awareness, then, is the theme of the novel. King gets us there not with a preachy polemic, but with exaggeration that is simultaneously hilarious and pathetic. Like a social histologist, he magnifies the idea-characters until they become bigger-than-life, so big that we can't escape their existence in our own priorities.There is a story line with suspense compelling enough to drive readers to the climax, but the surprising climax drives us right back to the text. Have my friends and I fallen for this or that idea? Where else have we gone wrong? Where are we going wrong now? What are our alternatives? What are my alternatives? It's as if you called King's bet by reading his novel. Then after exposing your life through the memories it evoked, you wait for him to lay down his hand. At the end, there they all are: the corporation, the market, the church, the fringe clique and the plutocrats. Read `em and weep...and laugh...and have a great hilarious and insightful romp through King's book.",1
I've only read the intro but so far I'm just captivated beyond belief.  I love how awesome of a writer Tom Robbins is and I can't wait to get further into the book.  5 stars thus far,1
"Well, let me first start by saying, if you're a Viking and you're coming to see this movie, stay on your long-ship and wait till you get to Newfoundland. Maybe Chronicles of Narnia will be out by then.I had high hopes for this, do to the cover, but let me inform you that these are not the heroes we witnessed in the 13th Warrior. They're more like the casting leftovers from the 200th warrior on back. With their accents and constant use of the names Thorston, Swen, Eric, etc....they come across as the cast of BH 90210 at a Renaissance faire. I guess that's to remind me, that they are Vikings.The plot of the movie is the same as Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"", except that it's Norsemen and not a cute little animated European town.The lead female character: Freya (Bell) doesn't want to marry the leading young male warrior, who is going on a Viking land grab mission with the king. All though her hand maiden (Ingrid), fits the bill for a Viking female or a lead singer in ABBA, the lead girl would be better served playing a role in a Viking/redneck sacking of a trailer park.The armor worn by the warriors (see Pauldrons), appears to be a cross between something out of Warhammer 40k and the Oakland Raiders. Their greaves are authentic leg warmers with attached steel plates.The weapons, swords specifically, appear to be genuine.....if the Vikings sacked monasteries and sea side villages with wooden practice swords painted in a metallic tint! The swords had a visible cutting edge of ¼ to ½ inch thick. Maybe these Vikings rode in the ""small"" long-ships....?Freya wears more mail than any other member of the cast, and during the close up of her encounter with the Viking/turned beast, you can see that it's plastic and doesn't conform to contours as real mail would due to its' weight.The beast appeared to be the evil twin from Army of Darkness dressed up like the leader of the Wendo chieftain in the 13th warrior.Don't get me wrong, this film did have a good quality, it helped my 22m old daughter fall asleep before the end of it. That doesn't happen often...must have been the fairy tale concept of the flick.So if you're sitting around one night, and have nothing to do, get Disney's version of Beauty and the Beast. They're more believable. If not, you could always file your teeth down.",0
This is the greatest movie that i have ever seen.  It is funny and the cast does some sweet moves.  I personally like the king of the mountain part. [...] Anytime by Eve 6 and makes no differece by Sum 41 is sweet,0
"WOW! Betsy Sanders truly inspired me to delve deep into myself and fill  page after page of ideas for customer service that had nothing to do with  her industry...this book speaks to any industry or field. Because fabled  service is so rarely experienced, but continuously sought after by  businesses everywhere, this book is a must for any new hire, established  executive or just the coordinator of a small volunteer organization. The  essence of fabled service is the people, so hiring and retaining excellent  employees is simply a must, as is recognizing their efforts, ideas and  energies expended on your behalf. I applaud Betsy and her comprehensive  collection of ideas, thoughts and direction to help others achieve true  Fabled Service in their own lives",1
"Our 14 month old granddaughter, whom we've been raising since she was born, has been listening to this CD for close to a year, it seems like.  We have other CDs that we've purchased, but this is by far the VERY BEST one of them all.  Accordingly, she (and we) enjoy listening nearly 100% of the time.  I've not heard a lullaby CD that is so soothing and enjoyable to listen to as this one.  This is a MUST HAVE",0
"I'm a mom with 3 kids. All I can say is that I wish I had some of these sleepers when my oldest was a baby, the zipper design is very convenient, I highly recomend it",0
"Listening to this CD in the car on the way home from the record store, I found myself cracking up. It was noise to me, pure noise that seemed totally unenjoyable. I sat there for what seemed like hours and when I looked at the CD player only 4 minutes had gone by. However, after listening to it again later that day, my attitude changed.I felt myself getting progressively more in-tune with the attitude of the players. The mess of horns is at first repulsive, then bareable, and as you continue to listen, it becomes just plain awesome. Each horn has a different sound, and the sounds interact and weave together. It's really like listening to a conversation. One horn makes a statement, the others comment on it or interrupt it entirely. The horn reactions are very human, while the basses and drums provide the background (with that beast Scott LeFaro soloing a good deal of the time, if you can hear it over the horns). It really takes a keen ear to hear these things, or repeated listenings. It takes a sense of listening for not melody, but timing and texture. If you're into free jazz its a must. It's definitely its own specific genre... it sure as heck ain't bebop, people. A creative noise masterpiece",0
"Very Cool!  The book is a great collection of science experiments for kids, written in a witty and imaginative manner.  ""Mad Professor"", like all of Frauenfelder's work, is worth purchasing for the exquisite graphic design alone",1
"This is an extremely well done book on explaining how to make different kinds of computer systems talk to one another. The title of the book uses the term SOA which stands for service-oriented-architecture. Other terms you might have heard for the same functionality include: SOAP (Simple object Access Protocol), WSDL (Web Services Description Language), UDDI (Uniersal Discovery, Description, and Integration), XML (eXtensible Markup Language), RSS (Rich Site Summary), or Web Services. These terms are not exactly the same thing, but are terms used as part of the implementation of data transfer between systems of different types. The internet is for the transfer of information from a computer to an individual who is going to read, look at, store or whatever the information that is coming in. XML, or SOAP, or SOA, or Web Services is the standard by which two computers can talk to each other. Want to see a system actually working. Go to www.Books-On-Line.com. In the upper left hand corner of the home page is a place to enter the ISBN numnber of a book.

"This is a post-modern expressionistic essay on alienation in modern cities, well worth your time..",1
"This year is the 110th anniversary of the publication of Dracula. Dracula, or Count Dracula, is probably the most famous vampire of them all. After one hundred years, Dracula is so ingrained into vampire mythology that when we think vampires - we think Dracula. You could argue that the reason for this began with F.W. Murnau's film Nosferatu. Although the main character, wonderfully portrayed by Max Schreck, is referred to as Count Orlok - the viewing public were not fooled! Thousands of fans knew Murnau was telling the Dracula story! And so began a phenomenon, Dracula is now the most portrayed character in the horror genre - beating the likes of Frankenstein - and notching up over 160 portrayals. Most notable of these, apart from the previously mentioned Max Schreck, include those by: Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee and, more recently, Gary Oldman. So, does this explain the unbelievable success of the Dracula novel? Are the scores of portrayals serving as huge advertising campaigns? Is this the reason why one hundred years on thousands of copies of Dracula are still being sold? Of course not! Bram Stoker's Dracula completely captured the imagination of the reading public. One of the reasons for this is that it is not written like a novel - one unknown voice telling you a story. Stoker's Dracula is told to us by many voices all of which are characters within Dracula. The protagonists tell us the story through diary entries, newspaper clippings and letters. This style of story telling adds to our fear while reading, as it immerses us in the character's plight and gives us the impression that these events could be based on truth. You may think this last statement ludicrous and it probably is, but the fact that we have never found the burial place of Vlad Dracula (Vlad the Impaler), only adds to an air of uncertainty. When you are alone at night, a copy of Dracula on the bedside table, the wind and rain pelting against the windowpane, what seems ridiculous in cold light of day seems only the more real with the unexplained noises that occur during the night. One of the most interesting reasons why Dracula has survived the test of time is quite simply; it is the ancestor of all vampire novels. All other vampire stories are descendants of it, even Anne Rice, who refers to Dracula in one of her novels as the, ""vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman,"" cannot dispute that her novels are descended from it. How do we know that every vampire novel is descended from Bram Stoker's? The reason is simple, Stoker set down a list of vampire rules, and every book that followed after has used these rules. These rules may have been reinterpreted but still today, most stay remarkably true to Stoker's original vampire laws. Stakes through the heart, fear of religious symbols, sleeping in coffins- these are all Bram Stoker's ideas. All modern portrayals of vampires and vampire slayers use Stoker's story as a benchmark, or something to aspire too. You could even argue that Buffy the Vampire Slayer's watcher is a modern interpretation of Van Helsing. Stoker was also the first person to coin the term ""Un-Dead,"" used to this day by fiction writers to refer to vampires or zombies. Not many writers have ever achieved the accolade of inventing a word that becomes automatically absorbed into the English language. In conclusion, if you are a avid reader looking to read one of the classics, you can't go wrong with Bram Stoker's Dracula, and like wise if you are aspiring horror writer- make it first on your list of books to read and inspire you",1
I love this thing. It hasn't failed to open anything that I've tried on it. My hands say thank you and when it bites the dust you can bet another one will be on it's way,0
"This book is great, its concepts are in both mathmatical and intuitive forms.  The graphical approach makes it easy to understand yet you still get the equations for actual implementations.  The second half of the book is all about examples/applications that are applicable towards all disciplines.  Excellent choice for understanding of the FFT",1
"A totally awesome movie when it was first released, Hawaii is based on the James A. Michener bestseller. Even at three hours plus, it still had to leave a lot of Michener's novel untouched, but the basic idea is still there. The breathtaking cinematography adds to it, as does an outstanding Elmer Bernstein score. Then there's the acting by the stars, Max Von Sydow as the missionary who goes to Hawaii to preach to the natives, and brings his own brand of religion with him. Julie Anderws is outstanding in a rare non-singing role as his wife. Richard Harris is excellent as the sea captain who is amazed that the preacher's wife turns out to be an old girlfriend.The supporting characters are just as memoriable, with an actual islander playing the queen, and also an unknown playing Keoki.All in all, take Hawaii complete, or don't take it at all. Wait until the complete version comes out on DVD. I rated it one star because of the cuts, but it is a five-star movie in its complete version",0

"John Lennon regarded IN MY LIFE as one of his most important songs. A long poem about the favourite spots of his childhood had gone in front of it. The lyrics remind to the amazing poem of THE OLD FAMILIAR FACES of Charles Lamb [1775-1834], which John possibly knew via the widespread anthology PALGRAVE's TREASURY. It starts: I have had playmates, I have had companions... "" sounds rhythmically like ""There are places I remember / though some have changed, some forever ..."" Steve Turner examines really every Beatle song back to his roots of daily experiences: Who did not know yet, now will discover, that John Lennon has meant (writing about SEXY SADIE) the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He wanted to express with this lines his annoyance over the guru's claim to leadership. Hidden behind the lyrics of the song A DAY IN LIFE is a real road accident, where the enquiry finds the photo of the squashed coupe of the hautevoleé belonging TARA BROWNE. SHE IS LEAVING HOME is based on a true story Paul had read in a newspaper. Who is that woman, who inspired John to the cynical lyrics of NORWEGIAN WOOD (and inspired the Sitar of George Harrison)? More than 200 photographies are shown: Eleanor Rigby's gravestone (that unmarried woman, only watching always other women get married) - the Victorian poster about ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!"" - Julian Lennon's drawing of his friend ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" - I'm sure, every Beatles-Fan will enjoy this book ...

The Age of Sacred Terror is a good book that details the modern threat of terrorism. It explains the roots of the ideology of what is known as Wahhabism. Wahhabism is said to be the excuse that people like Osama bin Ladin  use to spread his hatred. This book gives you the history of Wahhabism and the link it has to terrorism. The book truly illustrates the new threat that the world faces and that we should not underestimate religious radical groups and what they are capable of achieving. The one problem I did see with the book is that it uses unnecessary words that require a dictionary and long tangent explanations. Over all I loved the book. I would recommend this book to all studiers of terrorism,1
"Marina Warner's _From the Beast to the Blonde_ is a wonderful and engaging work concerning the cultural history of fairy tales.  Warner explores the &quot;stock characters&quot; and stories of traditional tales, and in the process creates an excellent work of scholarship and criticism in an area of literature that has been relegated to the nursery, but didn't start there",1
"It doesn't often happen that a release gets so much unanimous enthusiastic praise from both critics and audiences alike, particularly if the release is from an independent company and the singer is not a heavily promoted ""star"". But here it is - Sandrine Piau's Handel recital on Naive seems to be outshining many vocal releases of the past year (it was released in 2004) and the reason for this stir is simple: it is a stupendous disc from a great singer who deserves a wider recognition. Everything is special here, even the cover. In an era when so many solo recitals try to attract us through flashy covers (and often not much more inside), Piau is courageous enough to appear in what may well be one of the most unflattering cover photos ever made. Through this photo, Piau seems to be making a bold statement: ""I am not a cover girl, I am an artist"". And what an artist! Every phrase in this recital is delivered with utmost honesty and spectacular technical assurance, nothing is calculated or contrived. What is even more important, every Handelian heroine portrayed here is vividly brought to life. There is not a moment of monotony or routine - the selections cover a variety of moods and allow the artist to display not only her stupendous technique but also phenomenal interpretative gifts. It is impossible to get tired of Piau's singing! Her voice and singing style should appeal to both camps of opera lovers: devotees of the HIP movement and those who are afraid of HIP because of the stigma of ""white, bland voices"" that became a trademark of the movement. Piau's voice is small and delicate, but there is nothing ""white"" or bland about it. It is a gorgeous instrument, flexible and colourful, able to convey a wide range of emotions without resorting to ""special effects"".It is of course tempting to compare Piau's recital with the other highly popular Handel discs of 2004 (by Lorraine Hunt, Sarah Connolly, Renee Fleming) but comparisons don't really make much sense here for each of those recitals has its own virtues and each singer her own faithful audience. Yet Piau's disc risks being overlooked in the USA since the French soprano is not quite a household name here (in spite of some marvellous solo recitals in her discography). Let's hope this fantastic new disc will change this. (Kicek",0

"The chamber music of Gabriel Faure seems to have faded into oblivion. As a matter of fact just a few violinists have dared his works; it's absolutely regretful because of the fact Faure is a musician who has so much to say, despite all the prejudices around. This is an utter shame Faure must be listened and considered far beyond the well known triviality spirit lived in France during the last quarter of the Century, where the Belle Époque literally flooded all the imaginable spaces and seriously permeated an entire generation. Somehow he was born in the middle of a transition signed by two visible opposite tendencies; the beauty fragrances of the last thuds of a dying Romanticism and the emerging Impressionism movement; he was stranded and even trapped between these two artistic currents.These two Violin Sonatas represent to my mind, two profuse evidences about the originality and talent of Gabriel Faure, whose time has not come for him yet. Nevertheless it's time for you to get close around this notable and sensitive composer. It's useless to state these performances could not be in better hands. Grumiaux enriches and improves still more this emblematic lyrical pages with his musical partner, Paul Crossley, who was in the seventies and eighties an untiring herald of Michael Tippet `s piano music. Highly recommended. ",0

"Rene Descartes is often considered the founding father of modern philosophy. A true Renaissance man, he studied Scholastic philosophy and physics as a student, spent time as a volunteer soldier and traveler throughout Europe, studied mathematics, appreciated the arts, and became a noted correspondent with royals and intellectual figures throughout the continent. He died in Sweden while on assignment as tutor to the Queen, Christiana. Descartes 'Discourse on Method' is a fascinating text, combining the newly-invented form of essay (Descartes was familiar with the Essays of Montaigne) with the same kind of autobiographical impulse that underpins Augustine's Confessions. Descartes writes about his own form of mystical experience, seeing this as almost a kind of revelation that all past knowledge would be superseded, and all problems would eventually be solved by human intellect. In the Discourse, Descartes formulates logical principles based on reason (which makes it somewhat ironic that this came to him almost as a revelation). Descartes had some appreciation for thinkers such as Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes, but he thought that Bacon depended too much upon empirical data, and with Hobbes he disagreed on what would be the criteria for ascertaining certainty. Descartes was a mathematician at heart, and perhaps had a carry-over of Pythagorean mystical attachment to mathematics, for his sense of reason led him to impute an absolute quality to mathematics; this has major implications for metaphysics and epistemology. Descartes method was a continuation in many ways of the ideas of Plato, Aristotle and the medieval thinkers, for they all tended toward thinking in absolute, universal terms in some degree. Descartes in his first section discounts much of Scholasticism, stating that the only real absolutes are theology and mathematics; because theology is based upon revelation, it is therefore beyond reason, and thus, mathematics becomes the only rational truth. Descartes develops this idea further with rules of method, which include ideas of intuition, analysis and deduction. He uses some of his method to come up with his greatest proposition: Cogito ergo sum - - I think, therefore I am 'The Cogito is a first principle from which Descartes will now deduce all that follows.' This permits Descartes to deal both with rational elements and empirical data. The other major piece in this collection, 'The Meditations', includes several different mediations, including that on the existence of the soul, the existence of God, the material world, things we may doubt, and other philosophical problems of the time. These meditations do incorporate Descartes attempt to employ his method to some degree, but at the same time divert into other means. For example, Descartes' meditation on the existence of God is in many ways the Anselm ontological proof revisited, and has a certain circular reasoning to it. This is an important text, one that I read the summer before I went to college, and makes a good study for those who wish to see the personal element in the development of philosophy.",1
"I got in a bit of trouble and thrown out of school this year and my house too which was a bit of a shock to me. 2 nights before it happened I knew this album was dropping and picked it up. At first it made me feel like ''naaah, what the f...'' and didnt get played except for the first quick flick which I only found i liked one track but not really too much. But then as I packed my bags and had to leave to go up north to some far away city I kept a discman and a few CDs on me for the journey. After going through all the CDs to the point I was sick of them, I thought I would just put this one in. And sitting on the bus it just touched me and i really felt it, i just let it play all through and i just suddenly awoke to how good it really was. I was expecting something more hard like ''Dollaz & sense'' at first, but then it hit me and what quik was saying i was really feeling and it made an impact on me. This album was like my friend on a lonely journey into a new big city accross the country. It made me think about my lifestyle in many ways and opened my eyes to what I was actually thinking of the future, though I did not make a complete change it calmed me down lots. The production which I was not digging that much in the beginning had started to grow on me, and the lyrics and messages i was feeling completely. Quik has been a big inspiration for me and I have admired his work since day one. This again, is another classic from the top musician. I still preferred ''dollaz & sense'', but this has a very deep personal meaning for me as it strangely guided me through a very difficult stage of my life. Anyway, enough of my boring story lol. If you like Quik, which you should, or if you don't know him, BUY THIS NOW!!!. Click add to cart then fill in the rest lol. Tight album. Peace",0
"Bucking the Sarge is about a kid named Luther T. Farrel. His mother runs a housing business. Luther is only fifteen and he has a driver's license that says he is eighteen. He calls his mom the Sarge because she is mean like a drill sergeant. The Sarge can make almost everyone in town do something for her. All Luther really cares about is winning the science fair for the third year in a row. If he does this he will be the first kid in the school's history to do this. Sparky is Luther's best friend, and he isn't very smart. Sparky has all these get rich quick schemes, but they all don't seem very good. Luther gets a new roommate named Chester X. Chester X tells Luther about how mean his mom is, and tells Luther what he should do. Next Luther ends up finding things out that his mom had told him which really makes him mad .You would have to read the book to find out more.	This book was really good, that is why I gave it five stars. What I liked was it was a funny book. You never really new what Luther and Sparky would do next. Like all good books there are some bad parts. What I didn't like was there were some parts where all they would do is talk and not do anything. It got really boring at them parts.	Someone who would like this book is someone who likes to read funny books. This book is hilarious, because Sparky tells Luther to hit him in the head with a tile and nearly knocks him out.",1

"""Cats and humans have been friends for over 6,000 years. Since the time of the Egyptian pharaohs, the relationship has been one of mutual reciprocity...Indian folklore even suggests that cats taught us the practice of yoga. As the story goes, when a young prince was frustrated, anxious, and unable to find inner peace, he fled to the forest, where he met a cat that taught him the art of tranquility and the main elements of yoga."" ~IntroductionIf you enjoy having pictures of cats on your desk, now you can enjoy 313 pages (Sat/Sun on same page) of photographs that can be flipped over and placed at the back of the plastic frame (with an easel you attach after it arrives) as the days change. Each cat presents a different mood, from playful to mesmerizing, innocent to adventurous. This truly displays a wide range of cat behaviors and moods. Each ""card"" or cat picture is printed on coated paper so these pictures could be reused later in scrapbooks or on presents or framed if you find one you especially love like the two kittens found in an amusing predicament while trying to climb vines to get to a birdhouse. There are black-and-white and color pictures, full-grown cats and adorable kittens. Yes, there is a cat ignoring you with its back facing you and a kitten dreaming over a huge bowl of milk, sure to inspire new adoption longings. A few of the cats seem to be art collectors or at least show a great appreciation for posing in front of wonderful furniture or art. One cat looks like it is laughing and quite a few are blissfully lost in a catnap. Makes a kitten mommy's heart purr. So many beautiful kittens and loving cats. I must say that when I do Yoga, Princess Meesa (my constant companion when home to the point of wanting to sleep on the desk while I'm typing) loves to join me and maybe she is just approving of what she thinks she has taught me. She especially loves cat pose because then she can walk underneath me. The introduction is only one page, but each day has a quote or comment about cats and already I've learned so many things even before the year has begun. Like on Friday the 13th, there is a picture of a cat sleeping and it says: ""Hormones required for kittens' growth are released only during sleep."" There are also quotes by famous people who have spoken about their love for cats and there are a few health tips. ~The Rebecca Review ",1

"There is a mood that Bergman creates in his films that is special.  An intention seems to run so deep beneath the surface that we can only peel back layers of understanding but never arrive at the final solution.  One suspects that this intention is beyond Bergman himself who only provides a vehicle for its imperfect expression: a stage for the unpredictable interaction of autonomous concepts; which in Persona include ambition, sensual love, envy, fate, and madness. Liv Ullman's retreat from a savage world - her attempt to step off the merry-go-round - ends unexpectedly as the fate which has been frustrated in expressing itself through her persona begins to work through her caretaker, Bibi Andersson .  Ullman is left to watch, horrified, as an intrinsic piece of her identity is appropriated by someone else.  The self-immolation of the monk that Ullman had earlier retreated from is encountered once more as a kind of bonfire of her own vanity.  Fate is the consequence of a person's actions, and it catches up with Ullman who has run away from the responsibility of raising her son.  Andersson's own approach to an unwanted pregnancy is shown to be a more responsible reaction to life's challenges, yet it haunts her and provides the catalyst for the operation of Ullman's fate.Did Bergman intend to communicate all this at the outset?  I don't know or care.  This is moviemaking as a higher calling: an attempt to create an experience so rich that it leaves an indelible impression on the viewer, and changes him for the better.  It is mythmaking. ",0
"  This is it. This is the origional, the one that fueled the imagination of a generation, the one I have referred to since the day it first hit the shelves in the glorious days of yesteryear. Not the namby-pamby next-gen, but the frontier spirited, Great Bird inspired tome that should have been reissued years ago. Now with the 40th anniversary it is the perfect companion to the new 'Ships of the Line' edition.  Not too heavy in the techno-babble that would mark its descendants, the author managed to fill in the gaps left by the nefarious abortive efforts of NBC while leaving enough space for the minds of fans around the world to wiggle in and have fun.

"If, like me, you have been disappointed by the Jessie Stone series, this book will be a pleasant surprise. Up to this point, Jessie has been an underdeveloped character - his books have seem to have been back-burner material and second-rate effort by Parker.This one is different - and it is not a Spenser clone (like Sunny Randall)! Stone is working on two crimes at the same time and Parker paces them well so that the first crime (a rape at a local high school) comes to a resolution just as the second crime (a set of serial murders) finally starts to get interesting. No giant car chases or dramatic speeches as this book winds down, but it is satisfying nonetheless.The only complaint I have is Parker's insistence on having dysfunctional romantic relationships dominate Stone's personal life (we love each other but we just can't marry each other because that would stifle us, but we are faithful to one another just like we were married, blah, blah, blah...). This is just like he has done with Spenser, Sunny Randall and Phillip Marlowe. Geez, give it a rest",1

"  There's a lot of quasi- and junk science floating around these days. Malcolm  Gladwell's ""Blink""; Chris Anderson's ""The Long Tail"" and the big whopper, Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" serve as examplars. What each of these authors attempts is to claim great epochal discoveries where none exist. Gladwell's thesis the intuitive understanding is often the most accurate has been known since the first writings. Anderson attempts to recast marketing principles that were established by Richard Sears, Montgomery Ward and John Wannamaker in the 19th Century and Al Gore simply twists and recycles age old laments about the weather. In the end, quasi and political science fluff is soon forgotten.  ""Citizen Marketers"" authors McConnell and Jackie Huba have something to sell: their services to assist marketers in usiing blogs and other devices to ""democratize"" their communications with customers and clients"". It's gospel among service providers such as consultants that the most potent form of salesmanship is to set yourself up as a true expert in the subject. And McConnell and Huba do this in spades and, best of all, beautifully and informatively so.  ""Citzen Marketers"" should be read on three levels. First, as an argument that your organization must ""democratize"" communication with its market. This is the same argument advanced by Robert Scoble and Shel Israel in ""Naked Conversations"". The argument, frankly, is overblown. There are many legitimate reasons for a company not to be overly buddy-buddy with its customers. But ""Citizen Marketers"" is not as overblown in this regard as ""Naked Conversations"" and those seeking more balanced argument before deciding whether to launch a customer community will find this work very helpful.  Second, ""Citizen Marketers"" is history. The authors very cleverly enlisted the aid of University of Chicago Graduate School of Business students as researchers. As a result, the book is jam-packed with references to articles and books on the social phenomena of the new electronic media and its impact on business. There are 33 pages of endnotes. Overall, this is one of the best comprehensive histories to so far appear in print.  Finally, the book is an advertisement for McConnell and Huba - and it is beautifully accomplished. Not once do they blatantly offer their services. Only a few times do they even mention them in a discreet manner. Anyone who reads this book is going to walk away feeling that these two know everything there is to know about the subject. It's one of the best jobs of creating a ""halo effect"" I've ever seen.  This book is very much worth reading. Many of the facts are wrong, generally in a minor way. (The number of Chinese internet users is grossly understated just a couple of paragraphs after it is correctly stated.) Some simply reveal the youthfulness, ignorance and carelessness of the researchers: on page 81 we are told ""[s]ince the dawn of radio, anyone with a microphone and tape recorder could have been a broadcaster . . ."" The first audio radio broadcast occured in 1906, with commercial radio arriving in the 1920s. Early wire recorders weren't available until the late 1930s and tape recorders later still - and they were not easily affordable to the masses. There is also a leftist political tilt to the book which really has no place there to begin with.  Overall, McConnell and Huba definitely establish themselves as masters of their subject and self-promotion. Put this book on your personal reading list and prepare to buy additional copies for friends: it is that good.Jerr",1
"I love Wallace Wang's Steal This Computer Book 3. In this book, Wang takes his best-selling knowledge and writing style and focuses it on a new subject- sharing files. I learned a lot in the opening section. I have been familiar with peer-to-peer (P2P) networking since the advent of Napster, but I was not aware that such a wide variety of sources existed for finding and sharing files. Wang points out web sites, FTP sites, instant messaging and chat rooms and more where you can share files. Even better than that, he doesn't just list sites, but rather provides in-depth analysis of many, explaining what is good or bad about the different resources and pitfalls to watch out for. He also includes many graphic illustrations which help you understand the information better. This book sheds light on a number of ""fringe"" file sharing tools and resources. The mainstream is familiar with the likes of Kazaa and Morpheus, but Wang delves into many more tools. He points out some of the things to watch out for when using some of the shadier tools and networks as well. The RIAA and MPAA may not like it, but in some way, shape or form, file sharing is here to stay and this book will help you find what you need and use file sharing securely. (...",1

"""The result, then, of what is now called the historical-critical method was an understanding of the Bible as a collection of historically conditioned documents, reflecting the biases, backgrounds and idiosyncrasies of its authors.""  Michael Coogan Coogan's Archaeological Inquiry: Professor Coogan explains, ""The first challenges to this traditional understanding of the Bible as unequivocally the word of God, consistent and free from error, came in the 17th century, when philosophers challenged traditional views about the Bible's authorship and authority, by appealing to common sense, logic and historical method. By the 19th century this approach had gained considerable momentum. During the same period thousands of ancient texts-in languages such as Assyrian, Babylonian, Aramaic and later Sumerian and Ugaritic-were excavated, deciphered and translated. Many of these texts had close or even verbatim correspondences with biblical passages, so that the view of the Bible as a unique document without parallel came under irrevocable challenge. Finally, there was an exponential growth of scientific knowledge: The Bible was simply not true or not simply true, in the sense in which it had for so long been considered. Its cosmology, anthropology and chronology were often just wrong. For the most part, scholars engaged in this new criticism were not only believers but ordained clergy, generally teachers in seminaries."" Between the Scholars and the Pew A feel for the context Bible students are warned to be aware of the figurative devices in the Bible and the need to carefully read and study the Bible to become familiar with the ways that language is utilized. The evidence is clear that parts of the Bible are meant figuratively, and we are rejecting the Word of God if we refuse to consider the possibility of figures of speech. Origen went so far as to suggest that there were some passages of Scripture that had no literal meaning. We should not refuse to understand a method the Bible itself uses, but need to get a feel for the context, to see the types of literature contained in the Bible, the way it uses poetic language, the way it gives commands, relates history and predicts the future. Frye on the Bible: An ordained United Church minister as well as a critic and teacher, N. Frye wrote two major books on the Bible, The Great Code in 1982 and Words with Power in 1990. All his life he turned to the Bible for inspiration, refreshment and an understanding of the ideas behind Western civilization. As he said, his critical work, beginning with his famous study of William Blake in 1947, all revolved around the Bible. At one point Robert Fulford, a Toronto author and journalist finds him reflecting that the Bible leaves us with ""a very human feeling that if we were God, we would work harder to earn our keep; that if we were in charge of what happened, we wouldn't make such appalling bungles as God appears to be making."" In 'Northrop Frye Unbuttoned,' we read a closely related notion in the book; ""The worst thing we can say of God is that he knows all."" The Great Code: In 1982 Frye published The Great Code, which has since been translated into 22 languages. In it, he treats the Bible as a totally unified book, disregarding the scholarly agreement that it actually was written by dozens of writers in three different languages over a period of a thousand years. Frye declares that the coherence of the Bible's narrative as a whole is created by what he calls a 'U-Shaped plot,' that begins with the Genesis creation of Adam and Eve, family and garden state is followed by a fall into a long alternation of historical disasters and triumphs. He concludes with a final ascent back to harmony in the eternal city of Jerusalem at the end of the book of Revelation. This U-shaped pattern is repeated in dozens of minor plots of fall and rise in the stories of Joseph, Moses, David, or Job, and of Peter and Paul, each of which functions as a 'type' or pre-figuration of what follows and of the encompassing whole. Frye discovers the same kind of unifying repetition or typology in the recurrence of specific images throughout the Old and New Testaments--e.g. the image of the tree, the ocean, the tower, the garden, the sheep and shepherd. Such repetitions of plot and image tie the many books of the Bible together, and also create a sense of deja vu and premonition, hinting that discreet events have some greater symbolic significance, that they are both themselves and not themselves, that time may be an illusion. Myth, Metaphor in the Bible: In 'Words With Power,' 1990, Frye re-examines the role of myth and metaphor in the Bible, reasserting that many of its central themes and images reverberate throughout Western literature. His conclusion is that ""the organizing structures of the Bible and the corresponding structures of 'secular' literature reflect each other,"" that a finite number of species of myths, including those of creation, fall, exodus, destruction and redemption, provide the narrative sources of literature. Such ideas, have been suggested by Frye earlier, in his study of the Bible and literature, as 'The Great Code,' a summing up of his overall critical views. Some parts of the book, which deals with different idioms of linguistic expression and the social function of literature feels as if Frye was just rewriting earlier assertions, trying to answer questions and restatement raised by his critics. A lineage of Mythographers: Frye remains the eighth most frequently cited author in the arts and humanities, among a company that includes Aristotle, Shakespeare and Freud. Much of his thinking about structure came from his study of Sir James Frazer's anthropology and Oswald Spengler's gloomy critique of the West. Frye traced his ancestry to a lineage of mythographers who all share the thesis that literature evolves from mythology and that both embody a community's core values and beliefs, about the devine and about secular matters from birth to death. In Northrop Frye Unbuttoned, he tells us, in a typically rueful way, that Alfred North Whitehead's Science and the Modern World influenced him just as profoundly. Frye in his own mind: Northrop Frye started his career as a divinity student and a preacher in the United Church of Canada, but then took an M.A. in English literature at Oxford and wrote his Master's thesis on the romantic poet and painter William Blake, whose sources of vision Frye demonstrated could be found in a literary tradition that stemmed from the Bible. Frye never seemed to have been a Christian in any conventional sense, he was a far from unquestioning Christianity. He not only didn't believe in Christian dogma, he didn't believe in Pistis Sophia, faithful belief; ""I don't trust anything that remains in the dark as an object of belief."" He had the consolation of knowing he wasn't alone; he was always turning back on his themes and ideas to restate earlier positions and modify them.",1

"The book is a polemic with carefully cherry-picked facts and contradictory evidence omitted to arrive at the author's conclusion that ""... only those few resistance fighters in the Wehrmacht who protested against extermination (of the Jews) in one way or another deserve our respect."" (page 296) Many conclusions are drawn from very scanty evidence, and an indictment of all 17 million men in the German Wehrmacht as criminals in the whole is certainly not scholarship.  The reader is confronted with many (untrue) editorial statements presented as fact: i.e. ""They (the German military leaders) had failed to grasp the significance of the fact that the countries with democratic governments had been able to defeat Germany in World War I because they were better able to motivate and mobilize their populations."" (p. 2); and ""Hopes for a more democratic kind (of armed forces), once espoused by no less a figure than Friedrich Engels, proved again and again to be illusory."" (p. 160) indicates both that the author looks favorably on Communism and that he understands that the German private soldier possessed little freedom for dissent (in contradiction to his arguments). The Soviet Union is presented most sympathetically, and even the massacre of 14,000 Polish officers by the Soviets in 1940 at Katyn was reduced to a mere 4,000 (obviously an editorial mistake), and noted merely in passing.  That upwards of 3 million German soldiers died in Russian captivity is not mentioned.  Yes, the war on the Eastern Front was waged in an especially brutal and merciless fashion, but this book adds nothing to the literature on the subject.  This book is not recommended for the serious historian, and Harvard should be ashamed of publishing this title except as a table book at the holocaust center alleging that all Germans in the Wehrmacht were bad and guilty of crimes against the Jews and humanity",1

"(this is the same review that I posted on Epinions.com under the user name alan-smithee).I've been a fan of director Paul Verhoeven for many years now. While he has often been criticized for using style over substance, I think that a lot of his films are done quite well. This is especially in regards to his Dutch films from the 70's and early 80's like Turkish Delight, Soldier of Orange and The 4th Man (which made a lot of people in Hollywood sit up and take notice of him). His first American film was the flop Flesh & Blood but he quickly made a name for himself with the awesome sci-fi/action film Robocop. He followed it up with the equally inventive & ultra-violent Arnold Schwarzenegger film Total Recall in 1990 before he made the controversial erotic-thriller Basic Instinct in 1992. Like his Dutch movies, these films showed he wasn't afraid of using explicit sexuality or extreme graphic violence to make his directorial point get across. Those last 3 American films were huge successes and Paul Verhoeven basically had everyone knocking on his door with projects of every sort. For reasons that will forever be unexplained, he then made the infamous soft-core flop Showgirls. This film was also written by Basic Instinct screenwriter Joe Eszterhas (who also has written Jagged Edge and Jade) and was notorious upon it's theatrical release because the filmmakers decided to make an unabashedly NC-17 major studio film. If this film had been a huge success as well as turning out to actually be a great film, it could have legitamized the adult only NC-17 rating and make other filmmakers/studios realize that the NC-17 rating could be a legitimate rating. People still think the NC-17 equals porn despite the fact that it was made to apply to movies too strong for an R rating but movies that aren't pornography either. But as we all know, this definitely wasn't the case. Showgirls turned out to be one of the worst and most laughable movies ever released. It's worth watching this movie at least once in your lifetime as it is truly mind-boggling that this film turned out so awful. However, over the years I've really wondered if Verhoeven might have meant for this to turn out this way, but I digress. :) The ""plot"" involves Nomi Malone (ex ""Saved-by-the-Bell star Elizabeth Berkley) who at the beginning of the movie is trying to hitch-hike her way to Las Vegas. Right from the start she comes across as very beautiful but extremely dumb (I don't think she might have been acting actually). She hitches a ride with a guy in a pick up truck who ends up leaving her in Vegas without any of her luggage. While puking in the parking lot(!), she befriends a young woman by the name of Molly (Gina Ravera). Molly lets Nomi stay with her in her trailer and practically overnight they are best friends. Nomi ends up getting a job in a strip club ran by Al (Robert Davi). While she is doing her strip routine one night, she catches the eye of both Zack Carey (Kyle MacLachlan sporting a K.D. Lange hairdo) and his bi-sexual girlfriend Cristal Connors (the luscious Gina Gershon). Turns out that Cristal is the reigning queen of Vegas showgirl dancers and has the premier job at the Stardust Casino. Zack is her boyfriend as well as her agent of sorts. Nomi gets angry after she catches Cristal flirting with her while Nomi's stripping and she gets upset and darts backstage. Al has all of his female strippers work the crowd after their routine trying to land a high paying lap dance with someone in the audience. Cristal offers Nomi 500 dollars to give Zack a lap dance which Nomi grudgingly accepts after Al pressures her into doing it. They make their way back into the lap dance area in which Nomi does a full striptease for Zack before grinding away in his lap causing him to eventually have an intense orgasm. Cristal is equally turned on by Nomi's ""performance"" at first but notices that Zack and Nomi got a bit too close during their lap dance. Eventually, Nomi gets a mysterious invitation to audition at the Stardust Casino in their Goddess stage show. Through some outside interference from Zack, she gets the gig. But she still wants to be top dog and ends up betraying Cristal in a couple of respects to get her top position. I should also mention that there also plot elements about Nomi's ""shady"" past and various other things including a completely inappropriate & brutal rape of Molly by a world famous singer that she greatly lusts after. Nomi also befriends a male black dancer who seems to think that Nomi actually has considerable dancing potential (he must have been blind). Also keep in mind that this film is 2 hours and 11 minutes long! The acting is just plain awful in regards to everybody in the cast. This film was supposed to be Elizabeth Berkley's big breakthrough role in Hollywood but it ended up doing the exact opposite. Her career has never really fully recovered from her appearance in this debacle. While she does look fantastic throughout the movie (though a lot of people I know don't think she was all that attractive in this movie), she just didn't seem to have a clue as to what she was doing. As for her infamous stripping/lap-dance scenes, she just doesn't seem to have the talent/ability to make these scenes thoroughly convincing or erotic. As great as she looks completely nude, she just comes across as laughable. Klye MacLachlan sleepwalks his way throughout the film and sports a haircut that makes him look like a dead ringer in a K. D. Lang look-a-like contest. Robert Davi has seemingly made a career appearing in dreck like this. The only person that actually benefitted from her performance in this atrocity was Gina Gershon. She seems to be the only who realizes how awful this movie actually was and plays her part with her tongue firmly planted in her cheek. Looking great and having fun, her performance is the only thing in this movie that stands out other than the abundant nudity. Paul Verhoeven usually has a very fluid directorial style but it is almost completely missing in this film for the most part. It seems that all he care about was the stripping/lap-dance scenes and everything else just fell by the wayside. The one thing I did really like was the nice cinematography. That's one of the few things that this movie has going for it. The big buzz surrounding the movie when it was originally released was that it was supposedly chock full of explicit (though simulated) sex and really earned it's adult only NC-17 rating. To be honest, other than the considerable (mostly female) nudity, I've seen R-rated movies that were much worse in the sex category. During Nomi's first strip-tease, there is a fairly explicit shot of her sticking her hand down her panties, the lap-dance is fairly in-your-face, and there is a sex scene between Zack and Nomi in his pool which is somewhat explicit but unintentionally goofy as she's basically just duplicating her laughable lap dance moves. But even that is for the most part shot from the waist up. Since this was designed from the get go to be a NC-17 picture, they should have pulled out all of the stops on the explicit sexual content to at least have the film pay off in that respect. What is on display here isn't really all that much more explicit than what was shown in Boogie Nights IMO. While the pool scene is energetic, it certainly isn't erotic in the least though Elizabeth Berkley looks quite nice soaking wet while completely nude.  I heard one remark that she looked like a dolphin having an epilectic seizure during this scene. There is also quite a few sequences of the Goddess performance in the Stardust Casino that mainly consist of men and women leaping and dancing across the stage while a fake volcano is spitting powder & glitter in the air in which Cristal emerges out of it. At that point, all the of the women had their tops removed and then they dance a bit longer before running off stage to change into their next outfits. The direction and camera moves during these sequences are quite a bit better than the rest of the movie, but they can't even come close to salvaging the rest of the film. I guess that the only way that I would recommend checking out this film is to just check out how putrid virtually every line of dialogue in this movie is. Elizabeth Berkley fans would also be wise to check it out as she does really look stunning and does quite a bit of full frontal nudity. This film was nominated for a bunch of Razzies and won pretty much every category that it was nominated in (deservedly so I might add). Paul Verhoeven actually was there in person to accept his Razzie for Worst Director which was the first time someone had actually shown up to accept their ""awards"". While he re-gained his momentum again with Starship Troopers and Hollow Man, the damage that Showgirls causing to everyone involved (with the exception of Gina Gershon) will never escape him. (on a side note, Denise Richards was originally cast in the Nomi lead role but ended up backing out due to second guessing how much nudity she would have to be doing. That I would have liked to see as I think she's gorgeous.)Every interview I have seen with him he seems to be in extreme denial about how awful this movie actually is. I seriously think that he feels that people don't completely understand what he was trying to do with the movie. The MGM DVD release of Showgirls presents the film in anamorphic widescreen in it's 2.35:1 theatrical ratio. Compared to the full screen VHS version, the DVD actually loses quite a bit of picture information on the bottom of the frame and gains very little on the sides as the movie was filmed in the Super 35 format. On the DVD, when Nomi is grinding Zack towards an orgasm during the infamous lapdance sequcne, the widescreen DVD version cuts her off from the waist down while in the VHS version you see everything. I know that this is the way it was seen in theaters but after quite some time of seeing it on full screen VHS I had gotten used to that extra footage at the bottom of the screen. While I normally advocate watching the widescreen version, this is a rare case in which I think that MGM could have easily offered a full-frame on one side of the DVD and the wide-screen version on the other. But alas, the wide-screen is all that you get on the DVD. While this is the way it was seen in theaters, Paul Verhoeven has stated that he prefers the full frame version. There are instances in the full frame VHS version in which you actually get more nudity and in a movie such as this turkey, nudity is all it has going for it. Other than the theatrical trailer and a short promotional featurette, this is pretty bare bones. The picture quality is excellent on the DVD and with the considerable amount of flesh on display, the flesh tones look very natural and the entire film just has a great look to it. The DVD is also the full uncensored 131 minutes NC-17 cut of the movie. This movie has also been re-released on DVD since this review was originally written in a VIP edition that gives overkill an entire new meaning. I am recommending this film mainly since that everyone should watch it at least once. It is so unintentionally funny that it will rattle your mind that anyone involved in this production thought they were actually making a good film. One of the worst films of all time!!!! (a quick side note that Denise Richards was originally signed on to play the role of Nomi in the movie but had second thoughts when she realized how much she was going to be completely nude in the film in addition to the somewhat explicit sexual nature of the movie). Showgirls is rated NC-17 and contains strong sexual content, abundant nudity, rape, strong language, drug use and violence. ",0

"This book might have been okie if not for the fact it talked to the reader as if they had not passed a second grade reading level. This book had one redeeming quality, the decriptions of the Gods and Goddesses in the back.  That's it. The rest can be treated with a pinch of salt",1

"The original Alice was and is of course an undisputed classic of both children's and English literature in general. What more can one say about Alice?On the other hand, while growing up, I never connected with Alice all that much.  Of course I was acquainted with the stories, but Alice was never for me a beloved favorite.  But one thing I have always loved personally (and even more as an adult) is WORDPLAY.  Martin Gardner helpfully providing the original versions of the poems and recitations (which every Victorian schoolchild no doubt knew very well, but are less well known today!), plus his remarks about historical contexts of things, shows you just HOW clever Carroll was really being.  Of course Alice can stand on its own and always has, but having Gardner's thorough and extensive commentary to help you know where all the jokes really are lets you enjoy it on a new and deeper level.  (As has been pointed out, far from being the occasional little footnote, Gardner's commentary occupies just about as much space in the book as the original text does!)Just for one example, I am still amazed whenever I open this book and see in the commentary the reproduced portrait of the actual historical figure who was the inspiration, visually if nothing else, for The Duchess.  (A noble lady whose nickname, if I recall correctly, was ""Old Pocket-Mouth"" and was said to be the ugliest woman in history. If anything, Tenniel toned her down a bit for his character drawing!)Anyway, summing up my comments on the commentary, Gardner's insights have in a real way brought me around to Alice, and that all the more joyfully for my being a bit late to the tea party.Now, this edition finally combines and concatenates the commentaries from The Annotated Alice and More Annotated Alice, so that they are all conveniently in one place.  This is really the ideal presentation I think.  The only thing that is lost by this confluence is that, in the original More Annotated Alice, Gardner took the opportunity of a second volume to use illustrations from another historical Alice artist.  In this combined edition, they stuck exclusively with the well-known illustrations of Tenniel.And, if you still needed any other purchase justification, The Definitive Edition is a very beautiful book, a very nicely bound hardcover with a handsome gold-embossed jacket.  Definitive Alice was one of the nicest holiday gifts I have ever received (when my cousin and her husband selected it from my Amazon Wish List a few Decembers ago, to my surprise and delight) and I still treasure it",1
"I found myself staggered with sticker shock while shopping for a decent pair of MTB glove, 30-40 dollars. No offense to the makers of these woefully overpriced digit protectors, but please! I did some research on the web, and the Harbinger gloves received good reviews from a couple different sources. The price was a fourth of the competitors, so I thought why not try them out. The gloves are great, and I have been very pleased with their performance. Not only do they have a cool look factor, but they also are well made. There is decent cushion(no gel unfortunately)built into the meaty areas of the palm, where you would expect and need it. Additionally, the velcro connection comes a little higher on the wrist,for full palm protection, which I like. Another nice touch is the tough  material used in the palm around the thumb and fingers. It serves the dual purposes of protection and grip. It is definitely tough and has handled some hard, hands first, touch downs.On the downside, I know I might get sweaty hands this summer(live in SW desert) because the palm area is all plastic verses leather. Yet, this is a fair trade for the protection and rugged construction. If you dont want to spend 40 bucks on gloves, and dont need  to have a gel cushion these are the best bang for the buck",0

"I was very much looking forward to recieving this title from Amazon.com after reading the first few pages online. And, admittedly, I did like the first few chapters; however, the tone and style of presentation changed very quickly, and became almost smug and self-aggrandizing. The authors seemed far too pleased with themselves, and, by approximately the halfway point I felt as if I were reading some kind of bizzare Conservationist Manifesto. I like to think - as a self-appointed conservationist and vegan - that I try to mind Mother Nature and all living creatures, but after I finished reading this repetitive, pedantic bore, I lost the will to care. Maybe I am being too harsh, but this book seemed to peak in the first chapter; then, it became exasperatingly preachy and redundant. Others liked the book, and that's fine; But I was disappointed",1
"When I first got diagnosed with ADD (as an adult) I believe the exact phrase ""You mean I'm not lazy, crazy or stupid?"" went through my mind.  FINALLY, there was an explanation.  So when I heard about a book by that name, certainly I had to check it out.  Once I did though, I was sorely disappointed. I have ADD, yes.  Nevertheless, I've still managed to get pretty far in life in spite of the ""handycap"" the authors of this book seem so eager to hide under. It's been a while since I read it, but I have the distinct recollection of finding some new example of a ""You can't succeed in the world because you are 'disabled'"" mentality on every page.  You can't do this, you can't do that, you've failed and you will continue to fail - just accept it. Excuse me?  I don't know about the authors of this book, but MY ADD makes me creative and intuitive and perceptive and just generally a genuinely unique and awesome person (egomania aside).  Where is this addressed?  Where are the helpful hints for harnessing THAT kind of potential?If they're in there, I sure didn't see them.  All I found were new little tricks for combatting the ""affliction"" with which I am (oh so unfortunately) beset.  Using these tricks, I can hope against hope for some semblence of a ""normal"" life they say.  Thanks but no thanks.  I'm doing pretty well so far, and I refuse to feel like some sort of mental cripple.If you, and the authors are happy considering yourself as something less than the rest of the world because of the way your mind works, feel free - this is the perfect book for you.  But you can count me out. ",1
"The SF Jazz Collective, brainchild of founder and executive director Randall Kline and artistic director Joshua Redman, has come up with something spectacular.The idea here is simple, but one that has seldom if ever been applied to jazz: find a younger established but adventurous musician, make him artistic director and give him the power to select a continuing group of players, fund them to write and practice, and then send them on the road.  Lots of potential pitfalls there--will the musicians mesh, will too much practice make them sound precise but stilted, how will they fit this work in with other gigs--but this group has seemingly managed to avoid them all.  Having the luxury of three weeks to practice--something unheard of in jazz--enables them to achieve the exact right balance between precision and spontaneity.An additional idea is for the group to select one major jazz figure per year on whose music to concentrate.  The initial selection of Ornette Coleman was a wise choice: he's modern, but approachable; well-known, but not overexposed; melodic, but quirky; and he's had a deep impact on lots of current younger jazz men and women.  This disc contains three Coleman songs and four group originals.  Somewhat surprising to me is that the originals are every bit as strong and stirring as the Coleman numbers, seeing as the group had the vast spectrum of the Coleman canon to choose from.  Especially wonderful are Miguel Zenon's snappy ""Lingala"" and Renee Rosnes's ""Of This Day's Journey.""An octet of mostly younger players--Joshua Redman (artistic director, tenor and soprano sax), Miguel Zenon (alto sax, flute), Nicholas Payton (trumpet), Josh Roseman (trombone), Renee Rosnes (piano), Robert Hurst (bass), Brian Blade (drums)--the ringer is old guy Bobby Hutcherson on vibes and marimba.  Including him was a brilliant choice.  Still at the top of his game as a mallet player, he brings both stability and added coloration, broadening out the proceedings away from a hackneyed post-bop direction and toward a welcome world jazz course.There aren't a lot of precedents for this music, but Wayne Shorter's Alegria and Michael Brecker's Wide Angle operate in somewhat similar territory, each with adventurous writing and distinct coloration.  What's different is that this isn't either a core of musicians augmented by additional players (Alegria) or a one-off project (Wide Angles): this is a real band.  Consequently, everything seems to be working at a higher level--group conversation, compositional and arranging ingenuity, ensemble voicings, and soloing.  This is simply wonderful music, brilliantly conceived, played, and recorded.  Certainly among the very top releases of 2005",0
"I've attended many senior-level presentations where the content provided (in many cases) focuses on People, Processes, and Technology. I've also listened to many executives/professionals talk about the importance of resolving the people issues in IT but unfortunately the people aspect is never really thoroughly addressed. Most of the discussion points focus on skills development and nothing more.Finally there's a book that focuses solely on resolving many of the people issues in IT. Doing More With Less hits the mark. The authors were very through in providing solutions to some very sensitive issues. I've implemented some of the recommendations in the book and in a few weeks have seen a significant difference in several of my key employees. Excellent book",1
"I'll always have a special place for the earlier books, especially 'Anne of the Island', but nothing is unmatched to 'Anne's House of Dreams'.I always have a certain problem when reading Anne books. Although I enjoy the plot and characters, I resent the melancholy, wistful feel to it everytime Anne goes into a new chapter of her life. There was the last chapter of the first book; 'A Bend in The Road', where the simple description and mood of the scene was so heart-wrenching that I almost cried. 'Anne of Avonlea' was just as sentimental as the previous book, with Anne realizing she cannot turn back time to when she was eleven. We, as readers feel the impact too. We have come to love each and every one character in Avonlea and we cannot stand to watch the years go by and be forced accept that the people are changing. 'Anne of the Island' cured that depressing tone slightly by bringing in cheerful college life but still retained the usual Avonlea village scenes into it. A romance brewing between Gilbert and Anne also helped distract readers from getting too upset about Anne growing up and leaving her childhood days forever. But nevertheless the proposal scene at the last chapter brought up those suppressed feelings out once again and left us smiling a bittersweet smile at the closing descriptions of the book.But in 'Anne's House of Dreams', we are introduced to a whole new atmosphere. No longer is Anne running dreamily into magical forests and delighting in fairy brooks, listening to the whispers of the trees or playacting as a Fair Maiden with her childhood friends. The fairy-tale, static forests of Avonlea are replaced with a vast sea, salty breezes and spicy scents of seagrass in the air. Whereas the previous books were stuffy and melancholic, this book is wonderfully refreshing and light. Instead of feeling that everything is going to end (growing older, beloved characters dying, leaving Green Gables and Avonlea), we find ourself anticipating Anne's new life as a married woman. And the plot construction! I've never read an Anne series with a plot so tight and focused. The twist at the end concerning Leslie's husband was the cream of the crop, and I've also enjoyed the beautiful life-story of Captain Jim. Even Anne and Gilbert are involved into this snug plot, they are mostly the benefactors of the events: Gilbert's idea to cure Leslie's husband and Anne's idea to have Captain Jim's life-story written down.On the other hand, I would complain that there weren't many scenes of the old characters; save Gilbert (duh) and Marilla. It's as if Anne is losing contact with her old life, which makes me a bit sad. I was dying to know more about Davy, Diana, Paul Irving, the Pyes, and even Charlie Sloane. I would love the series more if Anne remained in Avonlea and raised her family in the midst of the atmosphere that we have come to recognize and cherish. What's the use of getting us attached to the 'Lake of Shining Waters' and 'The White Way of Delight' and 'Lover's Lane' and 'Hester Gray's garden' and 'Dryad's Bubble' if Anne was going to move away and leave all those memories behind? Blame it on Gilbert. (kidding)I finished reading this book with a heart-warmed feeling in my heart for the first time, it seemed more appropriate as a beautiful closure to the series. It should have ended here instead of dragging along until she fades away to become a secondary character in the next three upcoming books",1

This book has pivoted the life in me and my co-workers. I found my Co-Worker weeping at her station talking with another Co-worker as the other women told her to please stop crying her life is not over and she can change the things she has said and done before the lord come for her. it touched so many personal issues in our life. I realized after we read this book that we all had unholy soul ties. We where able to find a way by prayers in the book to be freed from the unholy ties. with the guidelines the author gave to banish them out my life forever! This book will set you free from a lot of excess baggage we carry in our lives. Now I need to order 2 more books for my Co-workers as they wish to have one each so they can take it home with them to help the people they love change their lifes before it it to late.,1
This is a great book!!!  I laughed so hard!!  I can totally relate to this book since my husband and I are on fertility treatments. I highly recommend it. ,1
"A must-read. The author describes in details many different types of scams through which people get defrauded. The book is also fun to read because it shows how the scammers use people's psychological traits (like greed, insecurity, or even loneliness) to get them to part with their money. It's very interesting and you can actually see analogous strategies being played out in TV commercials or even in your daily interactions with people who try to get things from you. I feel much more prepared to deal with life after reading this.",1
"Paul Gilbert's most recent releases from Shrapnel had been the most delightful collection of music ever to come out of the label. Where many of the 80's guitar shredders I've listened to had moved on to playing fusion and prog rock, with greater or lesser success, Paul Gilbert has brought his outstanding musicianship to render taste and depth to good old' rock and roll and pop-rock music. The result is a type of musicality that only a musician of his caliber can create. Cool grooves and changes, catchy melodies, sweet harmonizations,  and strong motifs are the characteristics of his music, elements that are sorely lacking from the Vai's, Satriani's, Yngwie's, and Petrucci's. Like Burning Organ, Space Ship One is a gem among the genre, and Paul Gilbert has become one of my favorite guitar players joining the ranks of Joe Pass, Allan Holdsworth, Steve Morse, Michel Cusson, Christopher Parkening, and Michael Hedges",0

"At first, I cringed when I saw the price that most of these Chase CDs were going for. But, I decided to go for it and have been very happy with my decision. ""Get it On"" is probably worth half of what you pay for the disc alone; it is that good. You just can't beat the sound of the four trumpets playing that descending scale into the chord- it's gorgeous. For those complaining about the sound quality (esp bass): I thought the bass sounded just fine, and love it. If you play a brass instrument (esp trumpet), this is a must-have CD",0

"I had never watched this film before ordering it, so I took the chance.  It turned out to be a smart buy!  As usual, Peck is just awesome.  He seems to fit this role well, as if it captures a true part of his persona as a family man.  As the movie continues you  realize that you can relate to the character on a personal level.  I enojoyed the flashback sequences and thought they were placed well throughout the film.  Overall, this movie supplies drama and action for the viewer.  So, if you are considering purchasing this dvd, I'd suggest you buy it.  You'll enjoy it",0
"I found THE MESSENGER OF MAGNOLIA STREET to be both intriguing and eerie, and a very magical story.  I plan to read it again soon because there are so many nuances in the story and I want to make sure that I didn't miss anything.It's the tale of hard times that come to a cozy little town in Alabama called Shibboleth. The changes to the town take place over a twelve-year period and seemed to have started after Nehemiah Trust left the town to work for a senator in Washington, D. C.  Nehemiah was bright, kind and admired by everyone. The changes to the town were slow but a feeling of darkness, and in many people, forgetfulness, was sliding into their minds and thoughts. The town and citizens were becoming parched and dry just like the land around them.Not everyone was completely aware of the changes, but Nehemiah's brother Billy knew some odd things were taking place.  When his best friend, Trice told him they needed to get Nehemiah to come home he agreed.  Trice had always had some kind of psychic insight and Billy also longed for his brother's presence.  Nehemiah reluctantly returns to his hometown and the childhood friends reunite in a bond to save Shibboleth. The characters in ""Messenger"" are wonderful.  The story is told by an angel who calls himself the Recorder and he sometimes tells us what God has to say.  For instance, Aunt Kate is a bigger than life and kind-hearted woman who owns the local diner. She offers food and good will to all that need it.  At one point we are told that everyone loves Kate, and the Recorder tells us that God loves her too! I can't wait to see what River Jordan writes next!",1

This cd has all the elements of ""Perfect Time"" (her previous release) but done even better and has the added touch of a few more upbeat numbers that are very special and memorable. No filler at all on this one! It's very solid and just as soothing as her previous cd but there's definite growth to be found here. There's no denying that her younger sister Enya is a very tough act to follow, but I must say that this cd finds Maire equal to Enya in her own way finally! I won't point out each song to you as that's kind of what the samples are for, but each and every song on here is great and a few are exceptionally great! This is a journey you can lose yourself in.

"This is a terrific book on several levels.  First, just the love that these two women have for the people of Afghanastan and the picture they paint of life under the Taliban is interesting in and of itself.  In places it reads like a thriller, especially when they are arrested and their daring rescue.  Finally, just the incredible faith that these women exhibited under such trying circumstances is an inspiration to me.  Not that they are perfect, and they are the first to admit they struggled at times in those dark hours in prison, even bickering among themselves at times.  But in the end, their deep faith prevailed and a miracle occurred.   I felt like I was with them before, during and after their imprisonment, and that is a tribute to the great writing of this book.  And, by the way, much of the negatives reviews I've read here sound a lot more like anti-Christian bigotry then thoughtful criticisms.  Ignore them, and buy this inspirational, wonderful book",1
"Of all the things that I have seen it seems to me most strange that our dear Shakespeare should write such wondrous plays that even those his critics call less than his greatest do shine so strongly in the eyes of mankind that they do stun us with their poetry and their wit their insight into human character and humanity. So is it with Julius Caesar .For Ceasar is a most political play in which dear Brutus and his conspirators do find a way on the Ides of March of doing away with great Caesar. But Brutus who as you know is Ceasar's dear friend and in the name of friendship and love of Rome did do great Ceasar away , is taken to task by Ceasar's other mignon dear Anthony who in his mindful  farewell speech does set a standard for political rhetoric all mankind may have its eyes upon .For dear Anthony does let the Roman rabble know how much their Ceasar loved them , and does show how the ambition attributed to him by Brutus is nought but their imagining. And how great Caeasar loves them all. And so he makes not only the good works of Caeasar live after him but turns the general public against those very conspirators. And in this action and in what ensues the war which follows great Brutus too does come to his bitter end defeated by that Antony who allied with Ceasar's true heir makes a general reparation of the wrong . Oh what a wondrous play and what great speeches and immortal words .Think only of this , think only of such words as Antony's ' His life was gentle and the elements so mixed in him that Nature might stand up and say to all the world / This was a man. Oh great great play for all who would study the intrigues of Man and hear in great Shakespeare's  declaiming the vanity and folly of all ambition's greatness  while making their play immortal through his words.",1

"As anyone who has ever read Plato's REPUBLIC will tell you, the concept of justice is not nearly so straightforward as we would like to believe.   In a perfect world, all the bad guys would go straight to the slammer and all the good guys would be set free and exonerated.  We live, of course, in what is far from a perfect world.There are two extremes to the equation.  On the one hand, a police state where you're guilty until proven innocent and deprived of rights that could prove that you are, in fact, guiltless.On the other hand is a legal system that is so complex that there are thousands of loopholes every step of the way by which clever lawyers may get their client(s) off on a technicality - regardless of how absurd the technicality is.The present movie asks an intersting question:  what if a group of judges got together to do something about the latter situation and correct in-justice?  What if, being the incarnation of the ""law,"" they dispensed justice in a manner that was more beneficial to society (or so they hoped)?This premise leads them into the Star Chamber where they review cases at their leisure.  Of course, the obvious question arises: what if they mis-fire?  To complicate matters, what if the people they want to whack are guilty of other egregious crimes, but innocent of the crime they've been accused?Herein lies the premise of THE STAR CHAMBER.  It's too bad I waited until just recently to see this movie as I'm a fan of Michael Douglas and Hal Holbrook.  But, it was certainly worth the wait.  I'll see YOU in court",0
"One of the greatest screen personalities of the 1930s, Joan Blondell found herself being edged out of films by the decade's end.  Soon she would be reduced to playing the Shelley Winters parts before Shelley Winters found her niche, and then actually competing with Shelley Winters for the same roles, which must have been terribly frustrating for a talented actress like Blondell.  Here she is and you can just see a hint of desperation as she ""jumps the shark"" into a sort of limbo of ""being a star"" and ""no longer a star.""  I can picture her face when handed the script, ""And you get killed on page 15.""  What?  And this is long before Janet Leigh's brave decision to let her character get killed off in Hitchcock's PSYCHO!  But leave it to Joan, she took the part and really ran with it.  All the way up to the end she was a classy actress and the definition of ""star.""TOPPER RETURNS has a lot of fun with the idea of Joan Blondell as a ""ghost of her former self.""  Roland Young, Billie Burke, and winsome Carole Landis offer suitable support.  Eddie Anderson tries varying his Rochester persona here--he's great, but the script doesn't give him enough to do--or when it does (like playing with the trained seal) it's the wrong kind of thing.  However, like Joan Blondell, he rises above it with style",0
"I purchased this  book from a library close-out of old books for a mere 10-cents and having read it, I wouldn't sell it for ten-thousand pennies.  It is truly my most favored piece.  It's tattered pages have provided depth and riches to my prayer life as I'm sure it will to anyone who seeks a greater intimacy with our Creator and Father. Fosdick, in bringing the prayers of others into his pages, present a more comprehensive study to liberate our communication with our Lord. I can't love it enough for the way in which the Father is worshipped. A must read",1

"To understand business in the new century, we need to understand the political and cultural forces shaping global power.  Pastor and his six other renowned foreign policy co-authors argue that the key to  understanding the world's future lies in how the great powers shaped the  20th century.  This book helps us understand the recent history of  political influence on markets.  Pastor adds to his own important chapters  contributions by six of the world's leading experts on their respective  powers, e.g. China, Japan, Germany, etc.  The book is clearly written and  Pastor does an admirable job integrating both the contributions from the  separate regional experts and the lessons from the past that aid our  forecasts for the future.  This book teaches us much about the political  and cultural issues driving power relationships and leadership in the  global economy",1
"This book was so helpful to me as a full time working mother with a 7 year old daughter. The crafts were simple to do, yet looked like we had spent days in the making.

The wheel's don't have speed, which is what I was looking for. They are indoor // outdoor skates. They work better for inside skating. A great price and a great quality skate. Especially for a beginner (the Wheels). No matter what age you are, these skates are the best. I love these skates",0
"The author first challenges today's Christian education methods, conventional Sunday school and catechetical instruction, which in his eyes have almost failed its purposes for three reasons: 1) content is irrelevant to people's real lives. 2) Students are not engaged in true dialogue and learning. 3) Individualistic pedagogy fails to embrace community learning. Church life in its entirety should be formational instead of informational. The author argues that Christians should learn to perform Christly gestures rather than simply gain historical facts and other people's theological ideas. When Christians value Christly gestures, practice them in the church community, and learn to live them out in the real life with the help of Holy Spirit, transformation happens. Christly Gestures reshapes the very meaning of Christian education, exploring what the form and content of Christian learning would look like if local churches truly saw themselves as the body of Christ.Another point I like about his book is that it equally emphasizes on the formation of spirit, mind, and body, and contends for a deep unity of body and mind, of thought and action. In fact, as Brett discovers, the formation of human body receives the least attention in the fields of religious education and theology. The cons: this book claims to write for lay leaders and local Christian educators, but its writing style, complex theological discussion, and short of practical examples make it more suitable for students and teachers of religious institutions than for Sunday school teachers.",1
"If you are wondering where Victoria's descendants are, this is the book for you.  It is in two parts.  The first part focuses on the families with many pictures from the author's own collection.  The second part focuses on the genealogical information.  The format is lucid and newcomers should have no trouble following the family lines.  I highly recommend this book.  It is a great addition to anyone's royal or historical library",1
"Thank you, Brian, for your colorful and simple reminders that the real message of Christ is beneath and beyond all that gets called ""church"" today.

Christ is still speaking and continues to reveal himself in new, fresh and exciting ways. Begs the question, ""What new wineskins does he have in store for his New Wine today?"" Whether wise virgin and sleepy disciple, it is in our calling to ""watch and pray"". Now",1
Being from Midland you might say I'm a homer and thus have a bias towards this movie.  This movie was literally made at the very end of the oil boom period - in fact many of the companies' whose name appear through out the movie had gone out of business by the time it was released (that's how fast the bust hit).  Terry Jastrow (who is from Midland) and his real life wife Anne Archer are great opposite each other on the screen while Mary Kay Place provides great commentary on life in Texas Oil Business,0

"There is no doubt that Mr. Wolfe was a brilliant writer. More than once I found myself saying ""Yes, I know exactly how you feel!"" I suspect I am not alone in this regard. The biggest drawback, and the reason I only assign four starts, is the sensation that I am mining for greatness. What do I mean?There were some long stretches throughout the book that I found tedious.  My advice is to plough ahead for I assure you the sections that speak to the reader are that good. Wolfe's death at a young age was loss for us all.",1

"I recently saw the Lifetime movie. I havent read the book but I will. I watched this movie and was glued to the story because this was me. I went through this exact story line, to the point of SEVERAL suicide attempts and one issue that wasnt addressed was when the title SLUT is placed on a young girl she gets convinced that she is... the boys hear it and their ears perk up and take advantage of that title. I was fooled enough to think that their new found attention for me was genuine...I confused sex for love. I turned into that slut that intitally when the rumors started I wasnt. I was so desperate for love and attention and for the hurt to go away, I accepted these invitations from boys - which led to teenage pregnancy that led to an abortion. Another item is it led to social anxiety growing up. I lived being bullied for so long I am paranoid Im being ridiculed wherever I go. I dont beleive when someone compliments me...I am always thinking Im being tricked or ridiculed. That I wont fit in anywhere. I struggle with relationships ...all relationships and I am now 34 divorced and a single mom to twin boys (thank goodness I have boys) I know that the bullying has a part in my divorce and the fact that I have no female friends to speak of. Anyway I just want to commend the author for writing about this. Back in the early 80's there was NO where to go. No one did anything. I recall teachers joining the chanting and the bullying at times. I still have nightmares of feeling helpless.",1

"As usual, Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child confirm their great ability in writing cool, well-conceived page turners.In this book in particular, a lot of details about some of the characters are unveiled, and the ""Pendergast Trilogy"" featuring Aloysius vs. Diogenes finally comes to an end... and what an end!Apart from the praises for the writing style and action scenes, for the characters and the mood, another point I found particularly strong in this book was the obvious amount of research the authors did. I am Italian, and the small details, for example the streets of Florence, or the cuss exclamation of a Carabiniere, or even the cell number of a bus driver (which uses a correct prefix for an Italian cell phone, no fake ""555"" number) all prove that they really went into research for the book.Also, the frequent sentences in Italian are correct and do make sense this time (unlike some of their previous books where the sentences were dictionary-translated and light-years from what a ""real"" Italian would say).The only quirk I found was with the audio book itself - while the guy who reads the book has a fantastic voice and a clear, perfect tone, it's also very clear he is not at ease with the Italian language.Some accents he uses while reading Italian words range from mildly amusing to utterly ludicrous, but then I guess it's something only a native Italian speaker would notice.All in all, a fantastic book, definitely well worth it!If you appreciate Preston and Child's novels, don't miss this one, with a single caveat: for maximum enjoyment you will need previous knowledge of facts and characters, so reading the other books (at the very least Brimstone and Dance of Death, ideally quite a few others) is *strongly* advised",1
"While I agree that the 60s epitomize 12-18 years of self-indulgence, excess, moral decay, and rationalization, I found this book failed substantially to go from a cataloguing of horribles to a clear analysis of precisely how pervasively the perpetuation and idolization of these misguided ideals continue to undermine society.  The book promises just such an examination in its subtitle: ""How the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s Changed America,"" but falls far short of delivering on that promise.Mr. Kimball's abrasive (though, IMHO, accurate) portayals of the icons of the revolution should be only one part of the book, but he fails to take it the rest of the way and go beyond his earlier essays assailing each of these malcontents.A tough read, and definately not worth it",1
A wonderful book! Father David Anderson (an Episcopal priest from Bucks County PA) has written a book that is spiritually uplifting.

"I thought this book was much more than a humorous or adventerous account.  I am reminded of the book of Solomon and the wise adages endowed by God therein.  Bejamin Franklin's memoirs cover an array of wise maxims that all men should learn.  Franklin especially concentrates his philosophy in the way of frugality and financial responsibility.  Too many young men waste their lives in ignorance.  If more men sought out wisdom, the world would be a better place.   ",1
"Macmillan paints a clear picture of how all the hopes that were envisaged for the Paris Peace Conference --self determination, open door diplomacy, and a new world order based on genuine cooperation of nations-- never came to pass. Instead what happened was more of the same old closed-door deals, redrawing of of borders, and reshuffling of people without their consent--all of which were responsible for the war in the first place.This book is essential for anyone who wants to thoroughly understand what is happening in the world today. Pick any zone of conflict throughout the world and it's orgins can be, at least partially, traced to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. Examples include Kosovo, Iraq and Palestine.I do have one main criricism of the book. Macmillan neglected to mention the fact that Montenegro was the only Allied power to lose its independence after the war. Point XI of Wilson's terms for peace stipulated that the territorial integrity of the Balkan States be respected. Because the Big Four were pre-occupied with more important concerns, Montenegro had to pay the ultimate price by losing its independence. This is important because it illustrates the fact that promises made by the Allies as well as the 14 Points of Wilson's peace terms were appliled when they were convenient, and discarded when they were not. As a result, millions of people throughout the world were left with a deep sense of mistrust, resentment, and the desire to fight for their political goals-- this explains why almost every act of the Paris Peace Conference has been undone",1

Brings the dense air and thick grime of the oppressed world of Ociana to life without being pushy or preachy. If Orwell had lived as long it is MHO that he would have approved this film adaptation",0

"The Thomas train sets are great modern versions of the classic indestructible wooden train sets.  Simple enough to avoid the toddler age frustrations of getting the cars to run on the track yet complex enough to engage a wide range of ages (up to and including Grandpas).  All the stories help with the imagination part....the books & videos provide an endless source of adventures that can be acted out, although most kids are perfectly capable of inventing their own episodes.Here is my advice, if you are trying to work your way through the maze of start-up options:First of all, you can spend a fortune on a huge set....even if you can afford it, I would start with something small and give the child the joy of receiving a chain of small but intriguing presents over a long period of time.  It fosters the joy of giving/receiving and helps teach them to come back again and again to the same toy...watching it grow, asking for specific items from the stories they hear, etc.  Several reviewers suggest painting an old coffee table and this is a great idea.I suggest the Figure 8 set (the most popular one) or if you want to spend a little bit more, the Conductors Figure 8 set.  Both are complex enough to be interesting, but simple enough to give lots of room for growth.  Almost immediately I would add a new present of one of the inexpensive engines (you can ask the child which story they like best and get that engine for them....or buy the engine to go with the video or book in the same gift)....these would be Percy The Small Engine, Bill The Yellow Engine, Treavor, (or a bit more $ for:) The Lady Engine, James The Red Engine, Gordon The Express Engine (he's one of the best stories, I think), or Henry The Green Engine.Now for the good stuff!  Give it a month or so, and then reward the child with something really cool like the Barrel Loader or Rusty the Construction 3 Car Set.I honestly can't see the point in the huge multi hundred dollar system sets.  If you want to impress the neighbors or something, go for it, but I'm telling you.....most kids will enjoy a large number of small thoughtful gifts, not a ""keep-up-with-the-Jones"" effort on your part.Good behavior can be rewarded with a pick-your-own trip to the store (there are sometimes when a real time shopping trip can't be beat)By the way, the Thomas stories are based on real restored engines that run in England on the Mid-Hants Railway Watercress line near Winchester (you can read about them an even plan a trip to ride on the real Thomas trains by checking out  watercressline.co.uk).  They are a day trip from the London rail stations, although I recommend using a B&B in the Winchester area and staying overnight if you decide to go.  Winchester was the center of the old Saxon kingdom of Wessex of King Alfred as well as a major early medieval site (the Cathedral has the tombs of many of the Saxon Kings as well as Jayne Austen and Izaac Walton and it was where Richard the Lionhearted was crowned.)",0
"I had to make a comment about those reviewers that gave this book a low rating.  Dr. Sonna's approach on potty training may seem different to many, but it is very, very effective.  Her so called ""bias"" is to train kids in a different way than what we are accustomed here in the USA.  If you are buying this book it's because you are needing help in this area.  Maybe her advice is the advice you don't want to hear, because you've been approaching potty training with no results, and feel you couldn't possibly be doing it wrong.  Some of the people who negativiley criticize this book because it's teaching a different approach to toilet train probably would criticize their doctor for perscribing a pill that cures an illness that is causing pain, when all they wanted is a pain killer.  If you ever travel abroad you quickly learn that here in the US our kids are toilet trained much later than anywhere else in the world.  Her pointers, suggestions, and even, thank God, her humor really help you deal with what is really not a fun and messy issue in child rearing.  Throw out your (mis)-conceptions on potty training, open your mind to a different approach, buy this book, and follow the advice.  The bottom line is:  IT WORKS!  And isn't the whole point in buying this book to find a method the works?",1
"Understanding Nanotechnology was a good book to read for someone who desires to get a small introduction into the nanotechnology field. The structure of the book flows very well giving the reader a large perspective about nanotechnology, what it is about, and how it can be used. Furthermore, the wording within this book is not too technical since most of the information can be learned through high school chemistry or a semester of college chemistry. Due to the overall simplistic wording, the book allows people who don't understand too much about science other than the basics to be able to comprehend what nanotechnology is about and its many uses. The book places articles detailing the use of these nanomachines in drug delivery, genetic testing, and creating nano-scale electronics from organic molecules. The book allows the reader to slowly begin understanding how, why, and what this science intends to achieve. The book speaks about how definite and small these creations are and their possible achievements if duplicated by man. One such example is the use of proteins to create these electronics for the distribution of medication within the body at a more precise and efficient way. Furthermore, the book refers to the affects of nanotechnology within the computer world, and its possible replacement of silicon electronics. With the use of nanotechnology the pathways of those electrical signals would be more abundant and allow a faster and more efficient way of transporting information. Overall the book does a great job of showing a person with minimal science background the possible potentials of nanotechnology within the world and the basics behind this science.",1
"This movie, Equilibrium directed by Kirt Wimmer (Ultraviolet) is one of the most overlooked and forgoten gems of cinema in almost a decade! Amagine a world without emotion. There is no war, no hate, no envy, or crime. A perfect world? There is also no human being that can emote, feel, love, care, or empathize with thier fellow man. The cause of this... a drug that soceity takes daily to keep thier emotions at bay. This is the story of one man's awakening to emotion and love and about how he fights back against a system that keeps humanity under it's control by taking away what it truely means to be human. The story is epic in its scope and scale. The acting is beyond great. The action in mind blowing and intense. The star of this film is Christian Bale who would become the future of the Batman movies in C. Nolan's Batman Begins",0

"I recently read two very frightening things.The second was an article in ""Newsweek"" about Iran's quest to develop their own nuclear weapons.The first was this.This book is a fast-moving, concise collection of the stories of a handful of the survivors of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II.  The survivors are male and female, Japanese and German, young and old, and their stories--sure to make you think twice about your next nuke joke--illustrate just how it felt, just how it was, to be THERE, of all places, when the most powerful bomb ever detonated went off above their city.  Without ever becoming high-handed, preachy, overly sentimental, and without ever resorting to appealing solely to emotion, John Hershey has presented here the horrors of what happens when an atomic bomb goes off.  His book is relentlessly objective, consistently pasing up opportunities to editorialize in favor of chances to tell it how it really was.  He downplays the politics of the situation to focus on the physical suffering of the real, live human beings involved.  He tells of those who had their eyes scorched out of their sockets by staring at the blast, of small sores on people's skin that just wouldn't go away and then flowered into grisly red blooms, of skin sliding off muscle, of radiation sickness, of children wandering orphaned and wounded.  He puts a human face on the war's cold logistics without ever saying if he thinks what America did was right or wrong.  He just says, in essence, ""Regardless of why we did it, or what it accomplished, maybe there was a better way to go about it.""  He just asks, in a way, ""Was it worth the atomic legacy?  Was it worth the fears we have today?  Was it worth that article in 'Newsweek'?",1
"I had no idea H. L. Mencken wrote a book until I stumbled upon this treatise (shows you how much I know). Needless to say, I snatched it up in a heartbeat. The book is, unsurprisingly, a literary delight. I was, however, struck at how calm the tone was compared to the acid sarcasm in his dispatches from the Scopes trial. I have to confess, I enjoyed the peacable Mencken more, not that the old trouble-maker doesn't peek through once in a while to give us a good laugh. There is, for instance, a little passage about a &quot;rough Christian country.&quot; But I won't give it away - read it for yourself",1

The idea a race as old and powerful as they presented in the pilot could've gone un-noticed by the ""first ones"" and not have an influence in the Shadow wars of the original B5 series is completely ludicris to me.The acting was far from normal B5 universe quality.

My feelings are pretty straightforward: Any band that can make Britney Spear's ""Baby One More Time"" sound melodic, emotional and like a legitimately pure love song has my vote. I thought, in typical FOW form, that they would be basically making a mockery of an otherwise cheesy pop song, but I was surprisingly wrong! This whole two-disc set does not disappoint. It's Power Pop through and through. It stays strong and takes you for a fun, hip ride through original lyrics and offbeat topics (""I Want An Alien For Christmas"" - brilliant!). Like others have said, you never know what you'll get with a B-sides compilation, but this CD is A+!",0

Prior to getting my tattoo, many of my peers described their own experience with the pain of tattooing in terms of bravery ""it didn't hurt at all"" or annoyance ""it is really irritating.""By properly channeling the pain--rather than fearing, putting up with, or obsessing about it, however, I found the entire tattooing process to be so much more pleasant, profound, and meaningful.  I can truly say that I felt serene throughout the entire three-hour experience.I highly recommend this book for people interested in experiencing tattooing on all levels-the intellectual, the emotional, and the spiritual.

"I purchased this book as part of my preparation for an upcoming trip to Bolivia where I will be working with teachers. Not only does this book prepare me for my upcoming work in Bolivia, the ideas with which Luykx works also effectively analyze the schooling situation in the United States. I am even thinking of adding the book to a course I teach on Critical Pedagogy because Luykx makes the ideas of social reproduction, societal dominance and culture clash so understandable. Further, it is always easier to look at problems in another country than in our own, even if they are similar. Nonetheless, in this process, students generally begin to make the connections. The writing is strong and engaging. Some parts are fairly dense reading, particularly when she deals with theory and theorists, which she does abundantly. These sections, though dense, are powerful and helped me make connections I have not seen before. When she goes into actual examples with case studies in Bolivian schools, her writing is engaging and flows easily. Luykx is a trained anthropologist and spent a number of years in Bolivia developing this book. It is a powerful piece of work and I recommend it highly.",1

I admit at first that I love mysteries.  I especially enjoy mysteries where I care about the characters.  Finding a new series with a superb hero and a great writer is a treat.  It takes over your life.  Every Sunday I read the Times religiously.  But Booked to Die changed that.  I tried to read the Times but I kept thinking I should use my reading time to find out what is happening. So I had to read the Times a day late.  The only interruption I could handle was to watch the Yankees win their 4th straight against the hated Red Sox.  To make up for that I was up at 4 this morning to finish this wonderful book.I have always loved books but Cliff Janeway shows a whole new understanding of what that means.  The story is okay but the characters are what made me stayed glued to the book.I would like to write more but I am anxious to start the second book of the series which I have on my night table.  The Yankees won the fifth game this afternoon so I have nothing standing in my way.  Dunning is just a terrific writer writing a terrific series.  I will write another review of the next one when I get it finished.,1
"Fr. Pinckaers book presents a lifetime of research into Catholic Moral Theology from the Patristic era to the present, especially focusing on the atmospher after Trent, and the problems posed by the Protestant Reformation, and Modern Philosophy. Pinckaers shows us that many manuals of moral theology, while presenting orthodox doctrine, present the wrong reasons for that doctrine. Many books while claiming to follow St. Thomas and his brilliant Virtue Theory, actually are closer to Kant imperative: that virtue is following the Law for the Law's own sake, rather than for the sake of virtue. As a result many books rely soley on the Decalogue (Ten Commandments) rather than look at them as part of a whole, in light of the Sermon on the Mount. Pinckaers makes a terrific contribution to Catholic Moral Theology, and examines in great detail the works of Scripture, St. Paul, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, and the protestant reformers Luther and Calvin. The book is also not filled with overly technical language. It is written in such a way that an athiest who has never heard an iota about Catholic or Protestant Moral Theology could pick up the book and understand it. Pinckaers is the most emminent moral theologian of our day",1

"In Monday Mourning, the paths of Dr. Brennen and her ""favorite"" investigator Monsieur Claudel cross once again when Tempe is called upon to examine two sets of bones discovered in the basement of a pizza parlor.  As per usual, Claudel's arrogant attitude serves as a thorn in Tempe's side as she tries to persuade him that the burial site is relatively recent and not ancient.  Hoping to convince Claudel that they have stumbled onto a homicide, Tempe decides to do her own investigation.   Once she's onto the scent of the killer, bodies and clues begin to pile up.   Meanwhile, Tempe hears that Detective Andrew Ryan has been seen in the company of a very attractive, very young woman.  With this news, and Ryan's recent lack of availability, she convinces herself that their romantic relationship has begun to fizzle and that Ryan has decided to move onto his next ""conquest"".  She decides that she is finished with Andrew Ryan, once and for all, and plans to walk away from him just as soon as she completes her professional obligation to aid him in solving the case.      In an attempt to prevent the next murder, Tempe ends up allowing herself and a visiting friend to fall into the hands of the killer.  Will Detective Ryan come to her rescue, or is he too busy wooing a new love?  Check out Kathy Reich's Monday Mourning to find out! ",1
"All of the Daily Word books are highly recommended by me, but this one is especially unique.  It's best used as a daily family devotional, both of you reading the devotion for the day together.  The thoughts expressed are so loving, so appropos, so understanding.  The authors obviously are fully aware of the many difficulties that occur in relationships, and daily reading of these devotions will help immensely in maintaining loving attitudes for each other through the rough spots.  This book can be a marriage saver, as well as enhancing all relationships",1

"Not suprising liberals come up with this in order to try and silence some of the rare good Americans we have to speak out in true support of our great country. The author even uses ""HATE"" blatently, which only shows how blind the twisted perspective is. I know the conservatives like Savage and Coulter are definitely not liars and actually have the right plan America needs for adequate terrorist protection. Its also funny, Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh etc do not actually hate mentally ill liberals like author Clint Willis hates what he doesnt agree with,  but they are actually trying to help and change why exactly these people(extreme left) act in this suicidal, destructive and absolutly antiAmerican way of thinking.

"In this landmark case study, historian Rhonda Y. Williams redefines postwar urban history by placing black women's struggles at the center of an engaging and richly detailed narrative. Specifically, Williams focuses on the housing activism of poor black women in Baltimore to craft a story that expands the contours of the black freedom movement. By detailing the activism of low income  women around everyday issues of ""housing, food, clothing, and daily life in community spaces""--what the author describes as ""activism at the point of consumption--The Politics of Public Housing unveils a hidden  history of political struggle. Ultimately, this book chronicles the lives and heroic activism of tenants, community organizers, and single mothers who demanded dignity instead of demonization and held onto their self-respect in the face of horrible living conditions, insensitive bureacrats, and stigmas against pubic housing residents that relegated them to the political margins. Rhonda Y. Williams has successfully rescued these women's stories from history's dustbin and in the process produced a groundbreaking work of history.  Readers interested in African-American, women's, urban, and working class history will enjoy this book.",1
"This collection of scholarly essays is an easy and enjoyable read for scholars and laypersons alike. What's so great about it is how many perspectives it gives on, as another reviewer noted, ""the Kali phenomenon."" McDermott and others tear away notions Westerners have of Kali, and present a much broader picture of her mythology, worship and cultural significance. McDermott's concluding essay spearheads the Western fascination with Kali, and dispels many myths along the way - including common etymological mistakes made frequently by feminist scholars and writers on Kali. Western devotees of Kali should especially consider reading this volume - it will give necessary depth and breadth to your understanding of this complex Goddess, and is exceptionally readable. As this book was primarily written by and for scholars who are familiar with Sanskrit, those unfamiliar with transliteration diacritics will want to refer to online sources. Devotees who have Swami Satyananda Saraswati's excellent Kali Puja book will find a transliteration pronunciation guide in the back, which would be useful in this context",1

"Shut away in a hotel room in Las Vegas, with the windows blacked out, and a TV and six aides as his only connection to the outside world, Howard Hughes rules the world, if only in his mind.During the late 1960's and early 1970's, Hughes, who hasn't been seen in public in almost ten years, lives the life of a total recluse, in a ""germ free"" prison he has built for himself. Naked, only bathing maybe once or twice a year, with hair down to his backside, beard down to his navel, eating maybe once a day at the most, and storing his urine in Mason jars, Hughes writes out memos to his Mormon aides detailing to them, among other things, how to ""sterilize"" canned fruit to be served to him, despite the fact that his hotel room hasn't been cleaned in years. He also schemes about his plans to make Vegas in his image, including ways to allow people from all over the world to phone in to bookies to place bets and win big.Howard Hughes, in his final years, lived only for self. He considered himself the perfect man, a megalomaniac who shoots up with enough drugs to kill a horse, and writes out his orders on legal pads instead of picking up a phone or showing up at board meetings in person.""The Dating Game""For example, as Hughes is poised to buy the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), the deal dies in less than thirty minutes, due to his racist tendencies (out of fear, not hatred). He tunes in to ""The Dating Game"", to see a black man have to choose a date between what Hughes thought was two black women and one ""white"" woman. The man chooses the ""white"" woman, who in fact is not white but is actually a very light skinned black woman. But it doesn't matter to Hughes: out of his bizarre fear, the deal is off.In conclusion...A wacky story of a genius who became so afraid of the world that he ""tried"" to control it through his TV and his henchmen",1

"The book Dreamland by Sara Dessen is a very good book.  It was published by the Penguin Group in the year 2000.  The book is 250 pages long.  It's a fiction novel about relationships.	Dreamland is about a girl named Caitlin who has trouble finding herself.  She doesn't know who to turn to because her parents focus is taken off of her and put on her older sister who's run away and moved in with her boyfriend.  Caitlin's a cheerleader and has many friends, but when she meets a boy things begin to change.  The boy's name is Rogerson.  He's a wild kid who does what he wants.  They fall in love and Caitlin spends most of her time with him.  She starts to lose all of her friends.  At night she goes with Rogerson to all the parties and raves to sell pot. It's not long after she discovers Rogerson's secret that he has an abusive dad. She finds out he's the same way.  Soon she doesn't know the difference between love and hate and she becomes somewhat numb to the pain.  This story mixes real love and abuse.  When someone can lose all her friends because of a secret so big you get Dreamland.	I loved Dreamland.  It is now one of my favorite books.  Sara Dessen does an excellent job of describing the true life of teens and what an abusive relationship can look like.  When you read this book you laugh, cry and feel what Caitlin feels.  It's a very powerful book that you'll fall right in to.  When the abuse happens it's almost as if you're being hit right along with Caitlin.  The ending was very good as well.	The book left me wanting more.  I want to read it over again because it was so good.  I would definitely recommend reading it.",1

"If I could have just one recent book on my shelf to use as a reference for leadership development, organizational effectiveness, performance feedback and coaching, this would be the one.  Each chapter is authoritatively written in clear, approachable language.  Reflected in the chapters is a high level of professional and scientific discipline without a hint of academic arrogance.  Unlike many edited books having different authors for each chapter, this book is well structured and integrated so as to be readable either from beginning-to-end (probably the best way) or each chapter standing alone.  The chapter authors, each a recogonized expert, obviously paid attention to the others' writings.  Each author provides a complementary piece of the puzzle while avoiding repetition.  This handbook is an excellent example of how a compendium should be edited, and how a team of authors can blend their efforts on a complex subject",1

"No stiff upper lip Brit here, not at all. As a transplanted British journalist Alistair Cooke who studied in America's Ivy League universities and then returned to America as a BBC correspondent seems to have been deeply affected and impressed by what he saw here. He stayed here and became a citizen. If the little man and his small cracker-barrel anecdotes represented the collective spirit of the country Alistair Cooke's fascination of the common man's philosophy captured that spirit simply and eloquently in his writings. This simple eloquent approach addressed and exposed the heart and feeling of the people that drove the great country for higher aspirations of the human experience. This is what he wrote about. His observations and examination of the Civil War capture the fervent feelings that Americans held be they morally right or wrong. Yet at the end of this struggle the common purpose of the people did not deter them to find their destiny in this land. The spirit never died and that is what Cooke seems to capture, explore and explain in such eloquent words. ",1
"Orphaned Lucy Wickwright is the long-suffering maidservant and involuntary co-conspirator in the madcap exploits of her mistress Pauline, heiress to the Barony of Cant. However, their relatively carefree childhoods are rapidly nearing an end. Amid ominous rumblings of discontent and even revolution, Lucy finds herself caught up in plots against Pauline and the gum-chewing aristocracy of Cant, and must decide where her loyalties lie.Intelligent and well-written with an original premise (the premodern barony of Cant, tucked away in the creases of modern maps, which allows for modern incursions such as chewing gum and t-shirts), _The Secret of Castle Cant_ is a very promising first novel. The author's strongest suit, in my opinion, is the fact that he, like the best authors for young readers including J.K. Rowling, obviously respects the intelligence of his readers and doesn't write down to them. His ""footnotes"" and other references to the ""history"" of Cant also suggest that this world has not just been casually thrown together but carefully developed in his mind.Pauline and Lucy develop a wonderful friendship that outweighs their original class differences and, while spoiled, Pauline is portrayed sympathetically and is obviously in the process of changing to a better, less thoughless person by the end of the book. Lucy is fiercely loyal and, while her methods for avoiding trouble without strictly lying may be deplored by some parents, her use of them is certainly realistic (I know I did it), and is unfortunately in common use by many adult public figures these days. My only criticism is that boys close to the heroines' ages seem to be portrayed as either stupid or arrogant, but I hope that can be remedied in the next book.Altogether an enjoyable book, and I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel",1
"I am really sorry that this version of Yellow Submarine has gone out of print.  When it came out in 1999, I had not yet purchased a DVD player, but I did immediately buy the VHS version.  It was so wonderful, SO wonderful, and I read so many great reviews about the DVD, that I went out and bought the DVD, before I had a DVD player.  Then not only did I buy a DVD player but also a new Kenwood receiver so I could get all the benefits of the surround sound.  That's how crazy I was.  The really crazy thing is, it was worth every penny.  Plus it spoiled me.  I expected every DVD release to show the same care and quality that Yellow Submarine did.  The care that they lavished upon all aspects of this release, the video quality, the INCREDIBLE AUDIO QUALITY and the wonderful extras, are amplified by the horrible job that Miramax did on A Hard Day's Night.  It's a shame that Apple could not was not able to get control of that.  What a disgrace Miramax made of a classic.  Makes me wonder what is happening with HELP!, Magical Mystery Tour and Let It Be.

The concepts are easy to remember and east to implement, and the book is a short, easy read.

Good, quick read!",1
"From my own family experiences, I became numb to the world.  This made the process of finding a solution difficult because I couldn't even find a starting point for recovery.  This book was a fantastic source of enlightenment because it names, very specifically, the varying facets of shame and causes of depression.  It helped me really put a finger on what I was wrestling with, and give me a ""to-do"" list for therapy.  I don't think this book on its own will help you actually recover, but it definitely will give you a specific plan of action and greater understanding of how unhealthy behaviors perpetuate through generations.  I believe talk therapy is the way to successful recovery because they can recognize unhealthy behaviors that you don't notice.  Thankfully, professional therapists truly are a ""safe place"" to reveal secrets that tied you down.  I'd recommend this book to people who felt numb like I did (and do), and need a way to regain some clarity.  When you have the courage to face your darkest fears, you will realize it was worth a hundred times the pain in order to feel genuinely happy again",1
"I am a baseball fan. I played as a kid and go to seem MLB games in my home town of Toronto. We are in the same conference as the Baltimore Orioles (American League East), Cal's old team so I saw him play quite a bit. He is a graceful and thoughtful player. His four trademarks were a love of the game, natural ability, a lot of practice, a thinking player, and he has a lot of experience. Also he comes from a baseball family. In short he is among the best all round players to have ever played the games and to our benefit he stayed late after every game signing autographs - a rarity today.If I was going to pick one recent player to write a book an learning baseball he would be the man. He has intelligence, experience and the love for the game. Many other players might be faster, or better hitters, etc. but he was the total package, a guy that could pace himself on and off the field and a person that really loved the game and cared for the fans.So that brings us to the book. It is impressive! It is a work of love by the authors. It is well laid out with a chapter by chapter review of the game with lots and lots of bright color photographs, some in a time sequence so they show how the action evolves. He and the other authors appear in the photos wearing simple black and white uniforms demonstrating baseball fundamentals. He tries to explain some of the more subtle yet important parts of the game. He covers all the basic aspects such as pitching, how to hold the pitched ball, catching, playing the infield, the outfield, hitting, etc.Excellent for all levels of baseball, playing or a fan. Highly recommend. Everyone will learn something new, even old fans like me",1

"Put simply, this is the most sensual portrayal of the vampire myth in recent cinematic history, and it does a neat turnaround of the roles, since most renditions have a sweet, innocent young woman seduced by a dark, handsome bloodsucker.Instead, Jenny Wright is the ethereally beautiful, seductive, mysterious stranger who initiates Adrian Pasdar (as farm boy Caleb Colton, whose openly displayed lust is kind of amusing for a minute there) into the mysteries of her night-focused world. Watch her during the scenes in which she bites Caleb -- and later, kills for him. Jenny Wright certainly never reached the caliber of Meryl Streep during her short career, but she COULD act. Her performance as Mae in ""Near Dark"" was chilling -- and admirable.Caleb is on a sort of probationary vampire status, and he finds it impossible to kill (which is a requirement, since according to Mae, ""The night has its price."") And yes, the end is probably not what the readers of Fangoria would have preferred, although they probably would've bailed on this anyway once they learned the only real gore was in the bar room scene.Terrific supporting cast, especially Bill Paxton, who stole every scene he was in. But the scenes with just Wright and Pasdar -- oooh. Powerful, sexy, and unforgettable. Not to be missed. ",0

Medicines are explained and contraindications as well as how to live with the side effects.  Prednisone is a drug that is not kind to the body but sometimes necessary and worth the side effects when there is no other choice and this book explains why it is the drug of choice. I think physicians should recommend this book to all patients expected to be long term prednisone patients.  Oftentimes patients such as myself have no one to talk to and share concerns.  This book addresses those concerns,1
"Before reading Do What You Love, The Money Will Follow, I had an inkling I was in the wrong profession. NOW I KNOW I AM! This book is what I needed to motivate me doing something more fulfilling with my life.I've decided that I shouldn't be wasting my energy on a job (albeit, a good paying one) to sacrifice the important things in life- esteem, enjoyment and enrichment. Marsha Sinetar has given me something to think about and a road map to follow",1
"This is a very nice piece of work but not exactly an atlas of ancient history. It is a cultural geography of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It has far fewer place names than I wanted from an atlas and much of it is pre-history beginning some 40,000 years ago. It starts with a brisk and entertaining account of the author's methods for interpreting scanty archaeological and linguistic evidence. This is at once accessible, learned, detailed, acerbic, and engaging. There is a funny bit about how archaeologists will say ""a major new civilization"" when they mean ""a particularly disappointing dig"", or will say ""earliest known"" when they mean ""undated"", and more. There is a terrific account of what it took to re-settle humans in Europe as the last ice age retreated. The effects were strong on Northern Europe into historical times (indeed Scandinavia and some of Russia is still rising and drying out today). The author estimates the human population of all of Europe and the Middle East was only about 100,000 in 9,000 BC.  The book describes movements of peoples, languages, technologies, and writing systems. It maps out the earliest known trade relations. It includes many maps but with few place names. Rather they indicate where various ethnic groups lived and what technologies were used where. As it enters historical times the book describes the campaigns of rulers and empires. It is a beautiful piece of work and beautifully concise. On the other hand, if you are reading Euripides and you want to know where Lemnos was, you won't find it here. You will find the most famous places: In Greece, besides Athens and Sparta, are Mycenea, Lesbos, Argos. That is like finding Chicago and San Francisco in an atlas of the US.  But you will not find general Meno's birthplace of Larissa--which you would read about in either Plato or Xenophon.  It is like not finding St. Louis in a US atlas.  Those places are found in the Atlas of the Greek World (Cultural Atlas of) by Peter Levi.  And they are found in another book you should read anyway, namely the Landmark Thucydides.  It is a terrific edition available in paperback and it shows these places in detailed maps. ",1
"With those words, Mark E. Smith more or less sums up The Fall's entire aesthetic. Even when the music moved in a poppy direction, Smith's rambling bursts of vitrol always remained front and center. After the pop-influenced, but no less brilliant Wonderful And Frightening World Of The Fall, This Nation's Saving Grace returns the band to a more atonal direction, one which blends the shiny textures of the ""Brix-era"" with the feedback-drenched cacophony of Hex Enduction Hour. ""Bombast,"" ""Barmy,"" and ""My New House"" are all The Fall doing The Fall and doing it without sounding the least bit redundant. There's even the synth-jittery ""L.A.,"" a minimalistic piece of pop that only Smith and his crew could pull off. What perhaps makes The Fall so significant is that their layout was ripe for repeating itself, yet they always sounded vital. Maybe it's also for the sub-avant-garde experiments like ""Paint Work"" and ""I Am Damo Suzuki."" But The Fall still sound unquestionably original today, not just because music is in an awful state, but because nobody can touch what they did",0

"... of the giddily-demented and lunatic world of high fashion along with its tandem industries, where all the egos come ""super-sized"". Always with personal dramas big enough to match, as everone is truly an ""artiste""... of one type or another, and ALWAYS facing a career-altering and earth-shattering crisis of some kind, it's as if they're all living on some isolated island... cast-off from the real world, sucking-up all the abundant co-dependent and self-perpetuating ""it's all about me"" energy available just to remain alive, slowing sinking into their own self-importance; they are collectively their own eco/ego-system... but so many of us actually listen to what they have to say!!! Their pronouncements are biblical in proportion. I must admit that I watched this film three times, back-to-back, totally absorbed and fascinated.The many wonderful actors, obviously with specific real people in mind and drawing upon same, superbly paint their characterizations in broadly egocentric stokes, creating a rich glimpse into the closed, insular ghetto-ized world of high fashion, where everone is a STAR... or at least believes themself to be, and certainly behaves ""as if "".

"A.W Tozer has always written in a rare style. I have read his Pursuit of Man & Pursuit of God; both were enlightening materials. Keys To The Deeper Life, however, is the sounding of the voice of a prophet. It is indeed an apocalypse of spiritual truths. A.W Tozer looked deeply into the problem facing the church and delivered an oratory on the root-cause. He exposed many blemishes the Church institution of the day would rather not discuss. This book is reminiscent of the Lord's ""Sermon on the Mount"" - in tone, very direct; and in purpose, transparently corrective. A.W Tozer challenged the action and motivation of evangelicals. In every paragraph, A.W Tozer served a bi-nutritional diet of flame and water. With his characteristic earnestness he exposed the hypocrisy of contemporary Christianity with an unspoken plea for reform, yet understanding that ""reform"" is not a natural tendency of established religion, he showed the futility of going about Church as it then (and currently) exists.If the book reads like the Bible, it is because the writer was merely expressing the spirit of the bible writers in a modern tongue. He saw something the average Christian is incapable of discerning; something effectively tearing down the fabric of the church, yet deceptive enough to be imperceptible. He then went about diagnosing, and prescribing remedies with the style and language of the true luminary that he has proven to be. Keys to the Deeper Life does not come across as the average Sunday afternoon read. The very title of the book suggests it is tailored to the taste of keen bibliophiles, or folks who desperately seek for deep spiritual truths, and are patient enough to surf through deliberately enhanced prose in order to embrace a revelation. As a writer of Christian literature, Tozer already ranks amongst the very best. This book however elevates him from the rank of writers to that of prophets. The inspiration that birth Keys to the Deeper Life transcends a literal muse. As one would expected of a prophet, the message stood clear even in the face of his dazzling artistry. Those that are meant to find this book will. When they read it, it will leave a lasting impression on them. I hope you do.",1
"This is a lovely little book with great pictures which has really helped my daughter learn moves and draw them. The stories are well written and it's great that a currently popular ballet dancer helped with it, not one retiring and probably never heard from again.

William Stanek is the one guy I rely on for computer books. If he's written a book on a subject I buy it no questions asked - his books are always the best and the most informative. Plus he knows how to pack in a lot of information clearly and concisely.I've read Stanek's Vista Pocket Consultant cover to cover and found it to be excellent. Flipping through the book without reading it or looking at the index without actually reading the book I could see how you might possibly miss its coverage of User Account Control and Bitlocker but I doubt it.A few pages into the first chapter Stanek introduces User Account Control and how it impacts working with Vista computers. He follows up with extensive discussions of User Account Control in Chapter 2 and Chapter 5. This when I read it was some of the best most clearly articulated discussion of User Account Control I've seen then or since. There's also some of User Account Control in Chapter 6. I've read all three chapters several times so I knew exactly where to go for this.Bitlocker drive encryption is another feature that is of course covered in the book. It's in Chapter 15!This book is written to the final release. I was the one in our lab testing Vista before we used any Vista machines in our company. Last month (February) I had the book open as I went through every nook and cranny of the new os for 4 weeks - every screen and detail matched up with the Vista version shipped from Dell on our computers. Windows Vista Administrator's Pocket Consultant is an excellent resource and highly recommended! The author packs more information into this little book than some books 2X the size. I love this book and don't know what I'd do without it,1

i can not say enough about this film. This film is so moving that even someone who has not heard of the dolls would love this. A documentary about killer kane and how his dream is to reunite with his friends and play a show with the dolls. After watching this i do think about arthur often. Im not really quite sure why i think about him but i would have to guess it is  because of how moved i was by this and how beautiful a man arthur. i can truly say i will never forget him even though ive never met him he seems like a old friend.

"What can I say, I'm a Joanne Fluke junkie!  I love her Hannah Swensen series.  Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder I believe is one of the first.  They are all quick easy reads, and are suitable for teens and maybe some more intelligent pre-teens.  There is absolutely no foul language, and the romance thing between Mike and Norman is enough to keep everybody guessing and rooting for their favorite (mine is Norman)  If you like who-done-it's,want a light easy but riviting read, Joanne's Hannah Swensen's series are for you!  Perfect beach books, or being snowed in books.  Plus the recipes!  I've tried a couple from each book and they are wonderful.  Easy to follow and easy to make.  Although I have learned that you need to invest in a standing mixer to save your poor arms from falling off.  All in all you will not be wasting your money when you buy one of her books.  Thoroughly enjoyable, every one. ",1
"It has been my privilege to read and re-read this book with some teenagers who have formerly claimed their reluctance to read. Peter Sis gave us all the opportunity to read the pictures first: why the sepia toned photos and the father-shaped holes? Why the mandelas? The maps? The diary entries? Once engaged, and fuelled by the tidal oscillations of the various layers of drawings, composed symphonically, we could not help but read the book. For a generation accustomed to video players this book let us pause, fast-forward, rewind... a book to read forwards, backwards, and inside out. Sis lets us know that books are a treasure, that books can walk beside us for a lifetime and nourish the mind and soul in imaginings... I add this one to my list of 1000 books I would proudly give to any child",1
"HEARTS, which I am also glad to have, is definitely my most favorite album by AMERICA, eventhough they seemed to be moving further away from their original style of music.  GERRY BECKLEY's piano ballad DAISY JANE that features excellent harmony vocals, acoustic guitars, and the orchestra is an outstanding beginner, and DAN PEEK's HALF A MAN is an outstanding guitar rock song with excellent guitar riffs, the soulful female singers, and a brass horn section.  Unfortunately, this is when he begins to sound like he is stoned out or something, not that it is that bad though.  His WOMAN TONIGHT is also a excellent rock tune with DEWEY BURNELL'S talk box guitar, keyboards from DAN that I can only assume, the fuzz bass guitar by DAVID DICKEY, and alternating lead vocals from all three singers, along with the female singers.  I was surprised to learn about DEWEY playing the talk box guitar on this song when I first read about it from the liner notes of the COMPLETE GREATEST HITS album.  Although all three guys can play lead guitar, they just happen to leave most of the lead guitar chores to DAN.  DEWEY'S MIDNIGHT is an excellent acoustic ballad with the electric and acoustic guitars and the orchestra.  GERRY'S BELL TREE is also excellent with the keyboards and the acoustic guitars.  DEWEY'S PEOPLE IN THE VALLEY that features his singin, GEERY'S piano playin, DAN'S guitar solos, and the harmony vocals is excellent, as is his COMPANY with GERRY'S piano playing and DAN' guitar solos.  THE STORY OF A TEENAGE with DAN and GERRY trading off the lead vocals, the piano playing, the guitars, the orchestra, and the female singers in the background.  GERRY FM classic SISTER GOLDEN HAIR is excellent with his lead vocals, DAN'S rhythm and steel guitar playing, the acoustic guitar by GERRY and DEWEY, and the harmony vocals, DAN'S TOMORROW is a excellent piano ballad with his lead vocals, the harmony vocals, acoustic guitar, organ, and orchestra, and SEASONS is an excellent closing acoustic ballad written and sung by DEWEY with the acoustic and electric guitars and the orchestra.  Meanwhile, the highlight of this album for me is DAN'S acoustic ballad OLD VIRGINIA that reminds me a whole lot his song LONELY PEOPLE.  I love the way DAN sings on this song, along with the acoustic guitars of DAN and DEWEY, GERRY'S piano, congo playing by WILLE LEACOX, and the orchestra arrangement.  Plus, I love to play these two songs by DAN back to back on my 12-string acoustic guitar.  My only complaint about this cd is that DAN's SIMPLE LIFE is not available on this cd version.  Like I suggested for all new and old-time AMERICA fans, forgot the HISTORY GREATEST HITS album from 1975 and buy all the AMERICA albums from that time period, or you will miss out on a whole lot of outstanding songs.  The two albums HIDEAWAY and HARBOR (the last with DAN PEEK) that come after HISTORY are also good albums.  More importantly, every AMERICA album from the 1970s should be available in the UNITED STATES on cd so music lovers do not have to pay twice as much for imports, but I just glad I got all of these cds with DAN PEEK.

"Siegel progresses through the families of drugs one by one, showing how the effects of plants, herbs, and chemicals are all similar even between different species - yet all of them find an urge to partake in some of them.   A multitude of personal and third-party research adorns the book to back up his assertations.  This book is an excellent reminder that drug policy must take into account that many animals (humans included) are hard-wired to seek highs of one sort or another, and that simply banning a substance will not solve the ""problem.",1

"There are just some trilogy's that should not be made - and the Wild Things trilogy is one of them. This is not really a trilogy per se, since each of the films carries with it the same story, with the same twists. If you have seen the first, you have basically seen each of the sequels... except the sequels are both much worse. Take out the big name actors and make a direct-to-DVD release... and you have Wild Things: Diamonds In The Rough.I am sure you all know the story by now, but here is a brief synopsis... ""Things get steamy in Blue Bay, Florida, when Marie, a 17-year-old beauty, gets caught in a tangle of deceit and double-crossing after meeting the promiscuous Elena, the new girl at school. Will they get away with the perfect crime or is someone else behind this scheme?If you have seen one of the Wild Things films, you have seen them all. This film lacks the quality of the original - mainly because we already know the twists and turns to come. This disc does look great, and sounds pretty good, but the film takes away from the overall DVD presentation. If you want your Wild Things fix, the original version is the one to watch",0
"Okay, I definatly have a bias twords early American punk (the Ramones, Johnny Thunders, ect). But I must conclude this is an absolute punk classic! Being the first British punk album, you can definatly hear its American influences. Heck, most of it sounds like Johnny Thunders. Despite all this, it is incredibly unique and just flat out rocking. The Damned did punk rock before and better than anyone else in Britain. The songwriting is fantastic (most of it by guitarist Brian James) and the musicianship is much better than the average punk band. A good deal of the songs don't follow the set three-chord punk route. As I said above, Brian James was one of punk's best songwriters, with his tunes such as ""Neat Neat Neat"" and ""New Rose"" are undisputed punk classics. The band went downhill after he left unfortunatly, even though ""Machine Gun Etiquitte"" was a good album. I'm very glad to see someone had the brains to put this back in print",0

"Hmm, how to start.  There's a short list of mainstream hard rock/metal bands that don't suck, and System of a Down is right towards the top of that list.  All of their stuff, thus far, is worth listening to, but the self-titled debut still stands as their most striking and consistent album.  There are a few brief missteps, but it's an excellent album altogether, and it serves as proof that not every mainstream band needs to be totally dull and formulaic.Though SOAD haven't totally revamped their sound over the years, the debut still has a fairly distinct sound within their catalogue.  It's quite a bit more raw than their later albums, with a very explosive guitar sound and Serj still does pretty much all of the singing here all alongside some particularly frenetic drumming.  SOADs trademark, frantic, jittery songwriting is fully-formed already, however, and it's actually better than it would later be, as it just feels more natural than it would later be and they eschew the out and out joke songs that would hamper more recent albums.  At 13 tracks, however, it's got a tad too much material.  The two shortest songs, Ddevil and CUBErt probably shoulda been cut.  They're both kind of annoying, and 11 tracks is more than enough, especially since nothing else could be considered filler.Anyway, there are a bunch of standout tracks.  ""Know"" is perhaps my favorite track, with the best, most energetic chorus on the album.  ""Sugar"" is a notable radio track, and it shows SOAD balancing their act nicely, as it's goofy with out being self-consciously so and still rocks plenty hard.  ""Spiders"" is the other big radio song, and it's one of the most distinctive tracks.  A very eerie track, for sure, with some especially strong vocal work..  ""Soil"" is another excellent one, with probably the most frantic drumming on the album and the most impassioned sounding vox to boot.  Mind is another weird one which recalls ""Spiders"" slightly with it's combination of smooth, jazzy quiet parts and the eventual heaviness. ""Peephole"" is probably the most aggressively catchy song on the album and it has a fun pseudo-polka beat.  Finally, the album closes with another particularly strong track, ""PLUCK"".  This is another very typical SOAD song, mixing the wild, driving instrumental sections with the almost ethereal chorus.Ehh, I ain't got much to say here.  SOAD rocks, check it out",0
"The Bodum tea infuser is a wonderful item!  Whether you are making a cup of tea or a pot of tea, the infuser is easy to use, easy to clean-up.The one big DOWNSIDE is that the company selling the infuser did NOT include THE LID - - it was missing from the shipment.  In spite of this deficiency, the infuser itself works great - - and since I seldom let my tea sit for very long after making a cup, the lid is not essential ..although it would have been nice to have in view of having paid for it.  I find that this infuser is much better than those ""tea eggs"" that have to be filled, then screwed shut, and opened the same way to dump out after use.

"My professor for separations was really smart, but like most chemical engineering professors that I have met, they are too smart for their own good. He chosed this book because it was ""easy to understand"".Chemical engineering is hard enough, and the fact that this book is used in most separations classes does not help. Each chapter starts off with an industrial example, which is confusing if you're not familar with it already. The authors just throw out concepts that you've never heard before and assume you're an industry expert. As thorough as the book is, you won't feel like a better person after having read it. The authors don't seem to want to teach the subject but rather flaunt their knowledge. The most annoying thing is when the authors get to solving problems. They just start applying equation after equation and don't tell the readers where they get it from. Sometimes, it's not even an equation from that chapter or from the book!I don't consider myself a bad student, but I seriously could not do most of the assigned problems at the end of the book. How do I become a chemical engineer then? I prefer McCabe's Unit Operations in Chemical Engineering. Although it is not as thorough, and the equations are presented differently, I actually learned something and was interested in the subject matter. The authors relate the theory to real life, and it actually makes sense. In fact, I had to use the McCabe to solve some of the problems from this hellish book",1
"I started with an Olympus DM-10 DVR, using it daily for recording college course lectures that I converted to CDs I could listen to on my daily drive.  The DM-10 model was very adequate for my needs, and I especially appreciated the voice-activated feature, which cut my actual recording time (and thus playback time) in half.  I loved this model, although I occasionally had to be sure to download and clear the memory due to space limitations.  Unfortunately, I either lost mine or it was stolen.  :-(After 6 weeks of searching in vain for my beloved DM-10, I gave up and opted for a replacement.  While perusing my options, I can across the Olympus WS-300M 256 MB Digital Voice Recorder.  Its nice compact size -- and especially, it's incredible memory -- made for an enticing offer I couldn't pass up.  Sadly, after a few weeks of trying various settings on the WS-300M, it became clear that this mini unit wouldn't do the trick.  (See my scathing review of the WS-300M!)After returning the WS-300M (a major pain, since I'm waiting on the seller to return my money!), I looked into paying the extra bucks for the DM upgrade (DM-20).  Although the DM-10 price has nicely dropped from what I paid for mine, I noticed the 20 model has considerably more memory plus all the reliable features I could count on for my old DM-10. I live on graduate student loans, so money is incredibly tight.  However, I've learned my lesson from the WS-300M (and from an even cheaper Sony model picked up at, and hastily returned to, Walmart).  Sometimes, the $$$ is worth the savings on my playback time and frustration!My DM-20 model has been great so far!  It's got the familiar sturdy feel of my DM-10, but with considerably more memory space.  Its buttons are solid and in intuitive locations.  The lackluster recording quality of the WS-300M is a thing of the past.  It even comes with a carrying case (although the case isn't designed for use while recording, which is a minor flaw to this model). In short, I'm smiling again and appreciative of my new recorder.  Although I'm home on holiday break, I have one thing I'm excited about in the coming new semester:  My new DM-20!Spring 2007, bring it on!  :-)P.S. I've been using this new version for the past four months, and although the quality is exemplary -- it does tend to drop the ball at times when on the voice activated recording mode.  It may in part be due to the fact that the professor is very soft spoken. Just the same, this same professor recorded nicely in my previous DM-10 last year.  This could be an idiosyncratic issue with the specific DM-20 I bought.  I haven't touched base with the manufacturer about this yet, as I'm buried in coursework.  I probably will do that at some point, though -- after I try moving the recorder closer to the prof to see if it makes a difference.  I suspect it won't, considering it's a small room and I sit up toward the front.  Has anyone else who bought this had a similar problem",0

"One  of  the  best  book  I  have  read  in the  past  year  has  to  be Junie  B.  Jones  and  the  Yucky  Blucky   Fruitcake  ,  by  Barbara  Park  .  It  Is  a  marvelous   book   about  a  fruitcake  she  made  for  the carnival. One of the major  reasons  I  enjoyed  this so  much  is  what  happened  when she  went  to the  carnival.  She took  the  cake  home  and  it  was  the  as  hard  as  a  rock. Another  reason  I  found  the  book   to  be  so  wonderful  is  that  is  the  way  Junie   B.  Jones talks. She talks funny.  I like the part when she tells the clown to ""Back off"". She does not like the clown.  Of course my favorite reason for liking this book is she throws a sponge right at the meanie boy's face and said bull's eye.  As you can see, Junie B. Jones and the Yucky Blucky Fruitcake, by  Barbara Park, was truly my favorite book",1
".....when I first heard it at a listening booth in New York.  There was no hesitation in buying this CD. I read one review that said this CD is dreadful.  Well, everyone's taste is not alike.  This CD is fantastic!  I really like the songwriting, as well as the vocal and instrumental arrangements; also Dolly Parton is singing her you-know-what off.  My favorite tunes thus far is ""Halos and Horns"", ""If Only"", and ""Raven Dove"" (I think that is the title of the song).  Yeah sure Dolly Parton has obtained superstar status, but when it comes down to it, she is a brilliant songwriter.  I will also purchase ""Grass is Blue"" and ""Jolene"".  I'm hooked on you Dolly",0
"This book is poorly written. I do not think the goofs that wrote it have ever been Superintendents. This book could have been written in less then 20 pages. That is their biggest problem there is no meat so they had to drag it out. Next time wait till you have something to say before you waste my time because I read this book cover to cover. By the way, it doesn't make you sound any smarter putting in boring quotes by others. Cute cover but do not let that misled you",1
"I saw the Broadway production before the album was released.  I had listened to the original cast recording.  Now that I have the revival I can not believe how great this new production is.  I is a delight to listen to.  The entire cast is terrific, but Raul Esparza's understated portrail leading up to the finale in which he explodes with emotion and a beautiful voice just makes this production stand out for me.  This is a must for any collector of Broadway Music",0
"I've recently rediscovered Heinlein, and started reading Have Space Suit Will Travel again. Having finished the book, I now remember clearly why I loved this author so much years ago, and Have Space Suite Will Travel is one of Heinlein's best. This book is pure science fiction and it is seemingly written for the pure enjoyment of the reader. Have Space Suit Will Travel was originally published in 1958, and it reads as fresh today as I'm sure it did then. This is one story that is sure to be enjoyed by generations to come. Although this is generally regarded as one of Heinlein's juvenile books, Heinlein's writing is really for all ages. Younger readers enjoy it because its protagonists are themselves young people: Kip is a high school senior and Peewee is a girl of about twelve.What's the story about? When Kip develops an overpowering urge to go to the moon, he is lucky enough to win a real space suit in a contest. The space suit is fascinating to Kip but he ends up deciding to sell the suit for college tuition money. If the story ended there, it wouldn't be much of a story. What happens next though is that Kip decides to go for one last walk and when he makes a call on the spacesuit radio he is surprised to hear an answer to his call. He is amazed when a space ship soon lands in his backyard and a decidedly alien creature comes out and collapses. A second ship lands, an entity gets out and conks Kip on the head, and the next thing Kip knows he is trapped inside a space ship on his way to the moon. He wakes up in the company of a younger girl - Pewee. And this is where things get really fun.Kip's captors are ""wormfaces,"" a species of alien that has been in hiding on the moon and are intent on having Earth for their own. Peewee introduces Kip to another captive on the ship called the ""Mother Thing."" The Mother Thing is an and interstellar cop who radiates love and warmth, and inspires undying love and devotion. Kip and Pewee work to rescue the Mother Thing from the Wormfaces and eventually return to earth. As they do so, they endure captivity on Pluto, escape death multiple times, and eventually find themselves representing Earth in an interstellar courtroom where the future of Earth is in their hands.A great book for young and old",1
This book is truly one of the Christian classics. Berkof was a man of towering intelect and deep spiritual sensitivity. One can only profit from a serious study of this great work and contribution to Christian literature,1
"The unit is designed more for an external appeal, but not for real use. If you're buying a fish tank for a certain style, then this might work for you. If you want to keep fish, stay away!A lot of people reviewing this tank may not have a good understanding of aquaria, or what tank filtration and maintenance should be.  This is the only reason I can see as to why it gets good reviews.  Read below and you'll see in detail why I do NOT like this tank, and why I think it's bad even for beginners.  However, nothing is all-bad, and I want to start with the Good Things:What I LIKE about this tank:- Acrylic looks nice.  The best way to describe it is that it looks like it's not there.  - Acrylic doesn't way as much as glass- I've never had cloudy waterWhat I don't like:- Hard to maintain due to poor design: The opening/lid is very small. It can only be used to feed the fish, and supposedly change the filter cartridge.  Want to scrape algae? Scoop up floating debris(from plants, etc).  Better take the top off.  If you DO take the top off, it's bulky, since the light is integrated, you can no longer see in the tank to do any work! In addition, the light causes condensation of the top of the lid, so wherever you set it will get very wet.  If you're lucky enough to have somewhere to set the top so you can SEE, the surface WILL get very wet when the condensation drips onto the surface.  In addition, the entire back half is occupied by the filter(which I'll get to later), and the front has a support bar. for a 20"" tank? That means you have 10"" on either side to work, and with 4"" in the back gone, you're working in a 4.5""x 6"" area... this makes catching a fish, or scrubbing algae a pain because you're always taking your hand out of the water to skip to the other side.  This causes water to drip off your hand all over the place.  Acrylic also scratches easily, and is impossible to cover up once scratched.  Glass is more durable (but much heavier)-	- The Filter:This is a filter? It apparently does a good job keeping my water clear, but if you look at the design (Impeller pulls water up in to a ""trough"" that flows water across the length of the tank OVER (that's right, not THROUGH) the filter media, at the end, it flows over a ""bio-wheel"" and back into the tank.  Because it flows OVER the filter there is potential for a LARGE amount of bypass of mechanical filtration. This means a lot of gunk will stay in your water. Filter pads are a bit on the pricey side. Some will tell you they just rinse in tank water, but how do you replace the carbon?  Also, if I have a power outage while I'm at work, I'll come hope and have to ""prime"" the filter to get it going again.  Cleaning the filter involved removing this ""trough"" from the tank top, removing the impeller (that clogs easily). It's bulky and hard to work with.- The Bio Wheel:  If there has ever been a case of undeserved hype this is it.  Marineland has somehow convinced people, even very knowledgeable fish people that this is the best thing since sliced bread.  ""This"" is a case of the emperors no clothes!  It may ""work"", but no better, if even as well as other methods.  Color me unimpressed.  My reasons? I've tried this and the Emperor and actually get slower/worse biological filtration than on a simple AquaClear.   The wheel is another moving part, creating noise(splash noises) and occasionally stops. When it stops, the can bacteria DIE!   What's more is that every time I change the filter pad, the tank goes through a mini cycle again.  What does this tell me? That much of the nitrifying bacteria is living on the pad and not the wheel.  Even supporters of the biowheel will tell you that this happens.- The light:  It's a compact fluorescent, and it proprietary. It is located in the center, so the sides of the tank tend to be darker.  The tank is not evenly lit!- Surface Area  The tank measures 20.5(front)17.25(back)x10 deep.    When you keep fish, how many you can keep is about surface area.  The eclipse has about 205 square inches of surface area, negligible to a 10 gallon, and far less than a much cheaper 20 gallon kit(288 square inches) and with a standard 24x12 footprint, you have better options and prices on stands as well.   - A standard 10/20/29 gallon would be much more cost effective. A 29 gallon would be about the same price at a Eclipse at more than twice the volume. If space is an issue, a 20 gallon isn't much larger(3 inches across the front, 2 inches deeper) You can get a complete kit with heater and filter for much cheaper, Shoot, you can buy the tank and hood and pick your own filter and heater and still save money.   These tanks are easy for to maintain, Stands are common and cheap. -	My fish don't seem happy in this tank, when I move them to other tanks, they seem to perk up.  Granted, this is not fair as this is my smallest tank, but in general, fish prefer room.  Maybe if you bought guppies and neon tetras. A single Goldfish would work well, or two small goldfish.If I were just getting started and purchased this tank, this may be my last venture into the world of aquaria. The tank has been a nightmare, and I've had it with the small openings and constant mini cycles.  I'm going to replace it as soon as possible. My personal recommendation is to avoid the nightmare.  Acrylic looks nice, but if you go that rout, don't go with the `eclipse system"".",0
"Years ago, running has become something like an old brand of car in a new model year; everything has to be ""updated"" to keep a person at the forefront of the emerging technology.Equally, some years ago, Don Kardong - a U.S. Olympic marathoner - was asked how he runs the 26.2-milers.

"When my daughter entered high school, her English teacher recommended this book and informed the parents that it would become the ""bible"" for writing papers.  How correct she was!!! This book was used extensively by my daughter in high school. Now that she is away at college and took it with her, I purchased another one for my son.  I believe it is the most used book in our house, besides the dictionary.  No one can write a paper correctly without owning this resource",1

"As the author of Fibromyalgia: A Natural Approach, I am testament to my self-help approach. Five years ago I was almost permanently bed-bound and in terrible pain. My husband had to do everything for me, including feeding me, washing me and brushing my hair. However, I am now able to sit at my computer for four hours a day, I can do light jobs around the house, I can take short walks, and I have much of my social life back! Unfortunately, substantial improvements are not gained via the doctor's prescription pad, they depend largely upon the individual's own efforts and choices. The book, then, carries the very latest research findings. It also considers the possible causes of the condition. The style and format not only ensure readers secure a better understanding of fibromyalgia, but also that they will learn how best to reduce the effects of the condition. Areas covered are the disorders commonly associated with fibromyalgia; medication; diet and the digestive system; posture and exercise; complementary therapies known to be useful in treating the condition; pain management techniques, and a sensitive chapter addressing in detail the emotional consequences of fibromyalgia and how best to deal with them. The book has been endorsed by leading fibromyalgia experts in the U",1
"Oh my, all the terrible reviews for this book are true!!  Ms. Steel is excessively repetitive....I mean EXCESSIVE.  Ms. Steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book...and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over...you get the picture.  I too found myself saying, ""Okay, we get it already...""  I also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had.  I don't know the men Ms. Steel knows and hangs out with, but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other, as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them.  Oh please, no man on earth talks that way.  Especially to other men.  This book is completely aweful.  The plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention.  I have read many of Ms. Steel's books and I believe this one is her worst.  I have now started reading Sandra Brown and she is sooo much better.  I recommend ""The Alibi.""  So far that has been my favorite by her.  She has mystery, suspense, romance...  Her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than Ms. Steels.  To sum it up, I was completely disappointed with the book ""Toxic Bachelors.""  I highly recommend Sandra Brown, she is a much better author",1

"This remains the seminal work of its kind in the field and continues to be assigned by University professors around the world for use in Southeast Asian studies. Translated from Coedes native French, the book gives a clear  and conscise history of the Indianization process that occured throughout  South-East Asia in the first thousand years A.D. . Coedes is able to  transcend the mist of time and make these civilizations come to life.  He  was amoung the first of the western historians to realize that the  Indianization process was not one of a dominant Indian culture supplanting  an inferior Southeast Asian culture, but of two great cultures amalgamating  into a vibrant new form. Coedes takes us through the magnificent ruins of  the Angkorian empire, in the jungles of Cambodia, and makes the ruins speak  to the modern reader.  He shows how every part of these cities were emersed  in religous symbolism and splendor.  This book is valuable for both the  general and student reader. For any one interested in the history,art or  religion of Southeast Asia this book is a must read",1
"The songs on this cd have such great rhythm they almost make me want to get up and dance. The first song ""La Cabanita en la Playa"" really kicks things off. Then there are softer more romantic songs like track 2 ""Cielo Azul"". Track 3 ""Guayabera"" is another lively one and is my favorite on the cd. I like the way the cd combines songs that have great rhythm with those that are soft and beautiful. Either way all the songs on this cd are great. This is my favorite by Johannes and is worth checking out",0
"I would like to thank GOD that i picked up this album. this album is so hot, i never get tired of listening to it. I've introduced this cd to people that are not saved, and they be feeling it. I've been a fan of their music for years, but this one is on another level. You know a cd is hot when you have BOOTSY COLLINS on it, Good choice. So many songs on this cd you can bump in your car and people on the streets will move to it. One of my favorite songs on this cd is &quot;GANGSTA'D UP&quot;. That song is for the systems. I hope on their next album they bring back BOOTSY COLLINS. Everyone must get this cd. Do not hesitate on picking this cd up",0
"This is an excellent book to have while you're pregnant. I use it with The Pregnancy Journal and enjoy them both, however, Waiting for Baby is much more of a journal for recording meaningful entries in. The Pregnancy journal is great for day by day information and recording weight, waist size, mood and all that weekly, but not for recording much of anything deeper than that. Waiting for Baby has room for everything and even prompts you to write about things you might not have thought of!The only thing I would change about it if I could would be to add a few more ulrasound pages. I think there are only 2 pages for ultrasounds and I have 4 already at 25 weeks. But there is a doctor's visit section where you can record anything you might have missed in ultrasounds.I'd definately buy this as a gift for anyone I knew was pregnant and I'd be sure that they would enjoy it as much as I have",1

The tempos and sensuality of Brazilian music meshed with the artistry and joyous soul of Yo Yo Ma: a recipe for pleasure.

"Sandisk, leader in this kind of technology products sure do not come short with this one. It works excellent on my phone Samsung t609.I would have bought a 1GB but the phone manufacturer do not recomend it, so bear that in mind. For pictures the resolution at close range and bright light is just excellent. For music as an MP3, lots of memory and room to fill as well as for video. Data and in general is terrific...just like I said Sandisk leads the competition and also seems to be the the standard card for just about any product that requires this kind of card. I will most definitely and undoubtely will not accept substitutions. Only Sandisk is extremely reliable. Personal experiences with these products proof it repeatledly. ",0
"We bought this playzone after we returned the superyard. The reason we returned the superyard is because it is not sturdy, hard to set up, and high to be stepped over because it does not have a door. We are very satisfied with the playzone and recommend you to consider this product. The little door is helpful for the children and adult to go in and out, but yet I feel safe to know my baby would not know how to open the door. The set up is pretty easy, but most of all, the color and the toys that come with it. It makes my living room more like a childcare and not a children prison. The only thing that made me unsatisfied completely is the shipping cost. I want to buy some more corner extensions, but the shipping cost is almost the same as the price itself, and this product is not sold in stores.",0
"Gordon Fee has written an easy to read version of his larger work ""God's Empowering Presence: The Holy Spirit in the Letters of Paul.""  Recently, I read and reviewed Frank Macchia's book ""Baptized in the Spirit: A Global Pentecostal Theology"" and as much as I liked Macchia's work, this book by Fee is in some ways at least, better.  I like Macchia's work on tongues and their meaning, but Fee really does an excellent job of showing the continuity and discontinuity of the Church who is the Israel of God and the nation of Israel in the OT.  On page 50, Fee has a great chart that shows how that we are living in an already/not yet eschatalogical framework.  Fee takes great care to show that the most important thing for the Church to get hold of is that we are the eshatalogical people of God and the Holy Spirit is the down payment on and fortaste of that future which is the come.  He deals with Paul and is an excellent interprter of Pauline theology.  Fee does not dismiss the importance of the Spirit in Paul, but shows how that, although, Jesus is the center of Paul's thought, it is the Holy Spirit that is driving this life in the Messiah and that give energy and freshness to the revelation of Jesus.  This is an excellent work.  I recommend this for everyone Pentecostal or not.  I believe that a popular audience could probably read this book and benefit from Fee's great and scholarly insight",1

"Plot?  Not ""what plot?"" although the plot sometimes seems a bit beside the point in an Alexander McCall Smith novel.  In this latest of the Sunday Philosophy Club novels, Isabel Dalhousie is struggling with her feelings for her younger friend Jamie and the ethical questions this relationship raises.  She finds herself wondering about the relationship between two relative strangers, wealthy American Tom Bruce and his younger, possibly gold-digging, fiancee Angie.  We find ourselves welcomed to the fascinating mind of Isabel as she works through romantic and practical dilemmas.  I didn't like the first book in this series as much as I like all of the books in the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series.  However, I've liked each subsequent entry better, and this one is the best yet.  If I have a cavil with this novel, it's that Isabel's thoughts about her romantic interest--and her somewhat irresponsible actions--don't quite ring true for such a mature and worldly woman.  As I have the same reservations about M.C. Beaton's heroine Agatha Raisin, and Beaton is a woman, I won't attribute my feelings about this to Smith's being a man writing from a woman's point-of-view.  Perhaps I'm just a hard-headed (-hearted?) realist, and other readers will believe that love can turn any woman into a misty-eyed romantic.Regardless of that doubt, I still highly recommend this book.  As with all Smith's books, it's all about the journey.",1
"I watched this movie not knowing all that much about about the whole Mothman phenomenon, so fortunately wasn't in a position to have my expectations dashed.  I guess that's the thing about movies based on real or alleged events, and there's not much that can be done about it if you've already read up on the whole incident.  The movie should be taken for what it is, a good, spine chilling paranormal thriller.  The Special edition includes a 50 minute documentary on the 1960s Mothman sightings on which the movie is based.  Very interesting in its own right",0
"This is perhaps the most ""weak"" part of the ""Prophet"" trilogy, in that Deutscher thought Trotsky's opposition to Stalin was, at the time it happened, useless, as Stalinism was the necessary mechanism of modernization that made a future fully-fledeged socialist society possible. Now, amid the smouldring ruins of Stalinism and with the former Soviet bloc reduced to a sorry parody of compradore capitalism of the Latin American style, one can be certain that, in the long run, Trotsky was right, after all, but then Deutscher puts his case so throughly that one can see precisely in what he was wrong and therefore how Trotsky managed to make so outstanding and unexpected a prevision as the final demise of Stalinism. Only that makes this book a necessary reading.",1
"Princess triplets Drucilla, Sabina, and Tamara of the House of Skorpys share a telepathic connection that has made the three siblings best friends.  Their homeland is constantly under threat and assault by feral neighbors wanting to destroy their father the Earl.  Especially troublesome is the constant raids from Gurlyon, which this time includes the abduction of the trio.With Skorpys in pursuit to resche his daughter, their abductors decide to dump the women in order to foster their escape.  However, they don't discard the females anywhere; they thrust the women inside the Dismals, a deadly underground world filled with dangerous strange creatures and oddly, a large forest.  Rather then fold, Drucilla, Sabrina, and Tamara begin their trek out of these badlands starting by allying with a ferocious feline creature, the Climber and next with a human hermit Zolan, who insists there is no way out of the Dismals and that he communicates with the spirits of the former lost tribes that once resided in this wasteland.  While the ladies struggle to survive, their home is under siege by a malevolence that once ran rampant in the Dismals.Though triplets sharing so much in common, the three females come across as unique individuals with diverse tastes due to Andre Norton rotating the narration enabling the audience to see the same event from differing perspectives.  The story line is action-packed with the alternate Dismal underground realm an interesting locale though the connection to Skorpys is not clear until very late in the tale.  Fans of strong female fantasy characters will gain immense pleasure from THREE HANDS FOR SCORPIO as Andre Norton remains the Grand Dame of fantasy.Harriet Klausner",1
"Amel Larrieux's style is kinda like A fusion of hip-hop,Middle Eastern like rythems,groovy R&B,contemparary jazz,and African rhythms overlaid with the singer's soulful coloratura soprano  vocal.get up and INI are definatley the stand out tracks to me.one thing i like about amel's voice is that its beautifuly understated.and her voice is not over bearing.Amel's accomplished jazz scatting,coloratura soprano and whistle register is soothing to the ears.she uses her talent and not her sex apeal(and man is she HOTT!) to promote her music.she also seems to down play it as a matter of fact when i see her in ads,video's etc.i would not compare her to sade because amel is completly different from her.amel has her own style thats more eclectic.where as sade is more jazz/soul/island rythem sounding.either way this is a great album that got shuned cause it wasn't what the mainstream accepts.however i dont think she's underrated.in fact i think she's verry criticaly acclaimed.its just that the casual music fan isn't into her style of ""R&B"" (if you wanna call her music that).people have a right to their tasts in music but their sure are litteraly missing out on the Infinite Possibilities this cd has to offer to the R&B/soul genre..................*sigh* oh well their lost.",0
"We all have times of doubt about who God is and if His character is consistent with who He claims to be. Chip Ingram brings the one true God, the God Almighty, before you and gives you a clear understanding of who God is and why He is Lord of All. Chip Ingram is one of my favorite authors, there is no question he is led completely by the Holy Spirit and his style of writing is so personal that you are moved from the moment you begin reading his books. This book is no different from his others in that they are powerful, inspirational, and filled with a message straight from God. You will find yourself face to face with God throughout this book and you are sure to draw even nearer to Him. I would highly recommend this as well to anyone who is questioning their beliefs in God, a friend or relative who does not know God, or someone just struggling in life who needs to know God is with them. I HIGHLY recommend, ""God As He Longs for You to See Him!",1

"During the Summer of 1966 an electronics genius accidently stumbled into the intelligence business and virtually over night became a legend within the halls of the FBI, CIA, and intelligence agencies all over the globe. This book is the memoirs of Martin L. Kaiser, known also simply as ""Marty"". His little black boxes has brought down entire governments or administrations, and even almost 40 years in the business his products are as revered and sought after as Holy Relics. For the first time ever an insider who supplied classifed bugs for decades comes in from the cold, and exposes the soft underbelly of corruption within the CIA, NSA, and FBI. Hollywood has even produced two movies about this quiet genius without actually mentioning him by name. But now the governments secrets are out of the bag, and this book lays them bare. The book is filed from cover to cover with explicit details of how the intelligence agencies operate, how they buy their toys, how their little games are played, and what happens to people to expose corruption.The author also discusses his consulting work for everal movies including ""The Conversation"" and ""Enemy of the State"", both of which are based on his life. We also get to share both his joy, and his pain in this book",1

"John Jay is one those historical figures that most Americans with some knowledge of this country's political birth can recall, but not quite place. Walter Stahr performs a great service in bringing Jay's life story forward to this generation of readers. I think the author's balanced legal analysis of Jay's service on the Supreme Court is especially fine",1
"+++++This book's preface instructs, ""Don't feel compelled to read this book from cover to cover"" since it's meant for reading at a relaxed pace.  Guess what?  I DID read it from cover to cover!!Why did I do this?  Here are my reasons:(1) THE AUTHOR'S WRITING STYLE.  The author, Norrie Epstein, writes in a relaxed and leisurely but enthusiastic way making a somewhat difficult subject easy and enjoyable to read.  She writes for the intelligent, common reader who's tired of technical, academic (and patronizing!!) jargon.(2) THE BOOK'S ORGANIZATION.  The book progresses logically with general comments on the works of William Shakespeare (1564-1616) to discussing the man himself to looking at the Elizabethan stage and then lastly discussing the plays.  There is also a discussion of the Shakespearean sonnets.  Finally,  there is a fascinating end-discussion on the spin-offs that have resulted from Shakespeare's works (for example, music and films).(3) DISCUSSION OF PLAYS.  Not only are the popular ones discussed but the more obscure plays are also given attention.  The plays discussed are as follows: eight romantic comedies, eight histories, one ""problem"" play, seven tragedies, and one tragicomic romance.  All discussions are EASY to follow.  And don't worry.  There are NO boring plot summaries of the plays to read.For many of the plays, there is a ""What to Look For In"" section.  These informative sections highlight what is particularly significant in a play.  As well, a major Shakespearean character of a particular play may be highlighted and given more detailed attention.  For example, there are good, solid discussions of Shylock and Falstaff.(4) ILLUSTRATIONS AND PHOTOGRAPHS.  These are peppered throughout the book.  I especially liked the black-and-white photo of Patrick Stewart (""Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the starship Enterprise"") dressed up as Shylock.(5) SIDEBARS.  These also occur throughout the book.  They highlight interesting bits of information that the author wants to bring to the reader's attention.  One of my favorite sidebars is an open letter a critic of the 1600s wrote to Shakespeare entitled ""As I Don't Like It.""  He commented on why he didn't like the play ""As You Like It"" (one of the Bard's best plays).(6) INTERVIEWS.  These are scattered throughout the book.  The author interviews people (such as actors) who have a passion for Shakespeare.  Notable interviews are with Kenneth Branagh and Ted Lange (of ""Love Boat"" fame).(7) TRIVIA.  And lots of it!!  This Shakespearean trivia occurs throughout the book.  For example, what does Shakespeare's epitaph say?  Or, what Shakespearean character was Orson Welles' life ambition to play?Finally, the big question: who is this book written for?  Answer: for both novices and Shakespearean scholars--in short, everybody who is interested in the Bard.  I must confess that I thought I knew a lot about Shakespeare and his works.  Was I wrong!!  This book opened my eyes to how much I did not know.In conclusion, after you read this book, you'll probably be like me and say, ""What a piece of work was this man William Shakespeare!""+++++",1
"The book follows the real-life story of Chris Gardner, a self-made entrepreneuer and investor, as he perserveres over a multitude of personal, social, psychological, and financial obstacles. The book presents Gardner's thoughts, raw emotions, and intepretations as the incidents are revealed from his memory. The first act was a bit slow but captured the familial themes that motivate him in the latter portion of his life. Chris's step-father was verbally and physically abusive both to him and his mother. His mother was loving yet not always available due to run-in with the law. These circumstances cement Chris's desire to be a good parent for his son later on in his life. The second act presents Chris's self-awareness as a racial minority in California and a stint within the Navy. Throughout the latter  Acts, Chris overindulges in various temptations that ultimately leads him to descend into a situation of being a single, black father living in poverty.I feel this review wouldn't be complete without a comparison to the Will Smith movie. The movie covers only the latter adult portion of Gardner's life. The movie a good in its own right for presenting a character inspired and determined to overcome a row of circumstancial obstacles. However, the movie suffers from too many Hollywood cliches, too much insertion of grim comic relief (showing Gardner run frantically around San Francisco after thieves who steal his products) and most importantly inserted a messianic portrayal of Gardner as opposed to the real, aspiring but flawed portrayal in the book. While I acknowledge its difficult to provide this much depth in a 2-hour film, I feel this skewed portrayal of Chris as some sort of ultimate role model waters down the message present in the book. Chris, while a good and decent man and father, admits he has cheated on his wife, has experimented with drugs. Nonetheless, Chris's thoughts exemplify a sharp individual who sees the forest for the trees, knows how to think outside the box, and doesn't allow certain personal or business relationships hinder his own success. Gardner's confidence in himself, his ability to learn new trades and skills under constraints demonstrate qualities that identify Chris as a leader who can inspire others regardless of their own circumstances. I was rather impressed and inspired by Chris's ability to bear and dismiss pessimistic stress-inducing rhetoric from his pampered, sheltered co-workers, manipulative employers, and racists clients in order to succeed as a stock broker. Many of the readers who rate this book poorly due to the personal decision Gardner made in his own life have missed the essence of the autobiography. Gardner openly acknowledges that he made many selfish and wreckless mistakes in his life from start to finish. Even I will agree that Gardner makes many personal decisions during his ascension to wealth that I would probably never consider. However, the story of this book is Gardner's ability to combine heart, determination, and wits in order to escape the wilderness and pursue a life, vision, and positive sphere of influence within his own community. This valuable message is one I will never forget, which is why I highly recommend this book for others who want to put their own problems in perspective.",1

"I knew of Ritchie Blackmore when he was in Deep Purple and Rainbow, but this side of him is unbelievably awesome.  He formed a band with his girlfriend, Candice Night.  I would call it Classical and Celtic flavored music.  Candice has a beautiful voice, and Ritchie plays classical guitar with flawless picking that complements her voice.This c.d. is all about romance, but not the gushy, typical romance.  Most of the songs on here are about missing the one you love.  The singing is really good, but the music is also interesting with intricate guitar work from Mr. Blackmore.     It is the perfect music for me to write my books to.  I especially love ""Ghost of a Rose.""  This song has an ethereal melody, and words about longing and separation that have inspired a short story inside of me.  If you like Loreena McKennitt, Enya or Celtic music, you might like this.  ",0
I had already gotten a portable DVD player but after I saw this one I took it back.  For a cheaper price I got this one.  The screen is larger and the battery life is longer.  My husband and son LOVE it.  We haven't experienced any problems with it.  Great Buy,0
"If you lived through the 80s or are interested in learning about them, this is a great place to start.  Not simply a set of 7 CDs containing most of the popular songs from that time, this compilation contains a very exhaustive companion book that describes what was happening to American culture during the 1980s.  It was like looking back through an old family album.  I caught myself saying, ""oh, yea, I remember that!""  Everything about this set screams the 1980s, right down to the neon-colored designs of the box and on faces of the CDs.  Of course, no set of 80s CDs can contain every song from that time and some of my old favorites are missing, but I am glad I bought this set and can recommend it without reservation",0

"This book set the vision in my mind for the type of education I'd like to provide for my children -- warm, intelligent, full of life. A living education full of living books, living ideas, living people! For the past  eight years, I've tried to re-read this book at least once a year to keep  my vision fresh and my mind focused.

"These Woven Cotton Blankets are Yummy!!! I want more!!! Elegant, soft, gorgeous and my new favorite blanket on our bed!!! We are blanket officionatos now--because we have lots and I've recently purchased even  more different kinds of blankets. (I reviewed some of them as well) Woven Cotton blankets just look more expensive and decorative then other kinds of blankets.  We rotate 5 different blankets on our King Size Bed to cover our down comforter and not only mix and match with the decor but to protect from the dirt or hair that we or our animals would deposit, while lounging.  This Cotton Woven blanket would look good thrown over a couch or chair. I always get the most compliments on the looks of my cotton woven blankets, however, my WOOLRICH Down Throws are the most popular on our couches for warmth. This SAGE color is luscious. I recently purchased 2 different brands of SAGE and it's interesting how differently it can be interpreted. This one was more of a light apple color or peridot green. Ohhh soooo very pretty.  The woven pattern is elegant on our bed and it makes the leaves pop from the sheets and the comforter, which is folded at the bottom.  I love that it's lightweight yet heavy enough and is a high quality blanket.  I usually buy blankets (we have need for many) at discount places but I found this to be well worth the great price offered here.  It was free shipping too.  One of my better purchases here through Amazon.  My husband really likes it and he is a bit of a snob about blankets.  Every time I walk in the room, I give a happy sigh.  I hope this helps with your blanket purchases.",0
"Detective Inspector Hal Challis and must find a serial killer. His task is being complicated by the letters the killer is sending to the local newspaper, which publishes them. These letters contain information that the police would rather keep confidential. His personal life is being interrupted with phone calls from his ex-wife who through long distance phone calls is trying to put their marriabe back in place. She's calling from the sanitarium where she has been imprisoned for the past eight years for attempted murder -- his. To 'help' him, Detective Challis has a crew of helpers. It's not at all certain that they are more help or trouble. You kind of think that some of them might do better if they were to join his ex in the loony bin. ==A good mystery, characters with depth, a moving plot line, with some comedy thrown in.

"This is the new edition of one of the best books for introducing anyone to the sport of fly fishing, whether the angler wants to shop for equipment at Orvis or Wal-Mart. The information is clearly explained without going into tedious details that novices (and experienced anglers) don't want. Everything is covered here--from rod types to fly lines to casting basics. The excellent graphics are helpful--especially of the knots. Some books have knot instructions that are impossible to follow--""knot"" so here! For someone who wants to start fly fishing, this book would make a great start. Orvis no doubt added the color illustrations to compete with ""L.L.Bean's Handbook to Fly-Fishing"" (another excellent ""How to"" book). So, if you're looking for ""How to"" info, this is the book to get; for inspiration (both about fishing and life itself), pick up Schreiber's novel, ""Life on the Fly.",1
"The overall point of this book is that we are all Buddhas, possessing the the ability to perceive life as it truly is, not as the delusion most of us see; and that true happiness can only come from within. This book wakes us up and tells us we have to take responsiblility for our own lives, but empowers us in the process by teaching we are the only ones who can do that for ourselves. Nothing and no one can do it for us. Thought provoking and enlightening",1

A rat is a rat......is a rat. I guess this guy and others like him (see Henry Hill and Sammy the Bull) feel if they can make some money getting average citizens to read about their exploits maybe they can justify (to themselves) their betrayal of their friends and brothers. You'd be wise to save your money and not make these kinds any richer...especially one like this who is short on details when it comes to his association with the Angels. In my opinion he only used their name to help sell the book. Don't bother. Read Sonny's instead,1

"Honestly, it's worth 3 bucks.  However, if you're looking for realism, you came to the wrong place.  It appears to be an amalgam of separate samples, some of them more than likely created in a studio.  The mix is a little off.  It sounds like whoever did the mixing doesn't have a firm grasp on spatial reference, therefore, it doesn't sound terribly realistic.  The waves are WAY too short and small sounding.  It reminds me of the ocean waves in Florida where they are used to short, small wave sets.  Unfortunately, I live in Northern California, very close to Mavericks, the biggest waves in the world.  I was hoping for something a little more substantial.  I'm still looking for the perfect ocean CD.  At least there's no ridiculous synth music in the background, and there's very little seagull noise",0

"As a struggling, and starting, fiction writer I found this book to be incredibly useful.  James Scott Bell has some biases in his approach to writing, and his personal fiction style, those did not prevent him from offering a wide array of tips and tricks from a variety of sources.  His chapter on the question of whether to outline a project, or to free write, was particularly illuminating.  This is a book I refer back to",1
"Steven Johnson claims that TV is making us smarter.  (Explicitly in his New York Times article and implicitly in his book.)In support of this bold claim, he offers absolutely no scientific evidence. Yet his book is so skillfully written that he has managed to convince a huge number of people that he is correct. (It helps that so many people want to be convinced.)How does he accomplish this sleight-of-hand?In his book, he references a number of studies showing that video games improve various types of thought processes. The number he cites for TV. Zero. On the other hand there are numerous studies showing that kids who watch excessive TV (over 1 to 2 hours per day), tend to do worse in school, don't concentrate as well, have problems with language and reading, etc...By describing in loving detail the complexities of both video games and various TV shows, and then referencing these scientific studies (for video games) he gives the impression that both have a similar effect on the brain. This couldn't be further from the truth. Playing Video games involve effort and concentration, while watching TV actually slows down the viewers' brain waves, hence the zombie look.For more on TV's effects on the mind, see the Scientific American cover story (Feb 2002) ""Television Addiction Is No Mere Metaphor"".The arguments he uses to support his contention are that TV is becoming more and more complex and the Flynn Effect. The Flynn Effect is the fact that IQ's in the U.S. and other countries have been rising about 3 points per decade. What Mr. Johnson fails to mention is that this effect in the U.S. started in 1918. TV wasn't even invented until the 1940s, and didn't become commonplace until the 1950s. Mr. Johnson also fails to mention the fact that SAT scores have fallen substantially over the past 40 years.Even if TV shows are getting more complex (which is entirely plausible considering the amount of time and money invested in TV) there still is no evidence that that translates into smarter viewers.On the subject of violent TV causing increased aggression, Mr. Johnson is completely dismissive. He argues that because violent crime has gone down over the last 10 years, that that proves there is no real connection. Never mind that the U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the *entire* world. Also never mind the over 1000 scientific studies done over the past 30 years showing a link between violent TV and aggression (for both children and adults).The editorial review describes him as a science writer, but for my money, PR hack would be much more accurate.",1
"I have enjoyed reading this book, even though, at times, the challenge to live a more godly life is convicting.

"I felt  compelled to write this review after reading a poor review by another site visitor. I have been juicing for many years and most certainly swear by the Waring's centrifugal juicers for most vegetables. The Waring PJE 101 is superb - very dry pulp and lots of juice!!I had been looking for  wheatgrass juicers for some time, and, had tried out a number of friends' juicers while visiting them. They are universally average. Blockages, and difficulties cleaning them just put me off purchasing one for quite some time. One lucky day, I visited a smoothie shop and saw their Omega 8003, they used it only for wheat grass. I was quite impressed wth the 8003, it was fast and in the view of those in the shop who cleaned it, very easy to manage (you just unscrew the chimney part and rinse). The staff raved about it, and not just one staff member (there are several in the shop who rotate and because I made a point of asking them about it, they shared their experiences).I bought the 8005 as a result and am extremely EXTREMELY happy with its simplicity of use, ease of cleaning and perhaps most importantly, the amount of juice it provides. Don't get me wrong, I don't use this for carrots and other larger vegetables, I use my Waring for those, but for wheatgrass (and this is why I bought it), it is the Rolls Royce of juicers",0

"We were impressed with the huge scope of information and activities they fit into 256 pages.  The trek into Waipio Valley filled up the whole day and was one of the most memorable days of all our vacations.  Most tourists descend in vans and are zipped out in an hour. What a beautiful untouched place! It was tempting to swim at the beach but the advice in the book changed our minds.  If you go, be sure to take this hike",1
"This book vividly explains how empathy can have a profound effect  on your relationships. These can be business, personal, marriage, or any relationship. Getting to understand and appreciate the perspective and background of the &quot;other side&quot; can lead to a  more productive means of communication. Most relationships break down because of a lack of communication. The Power of Empathy gives one a road map on how to direct your thoughts, actions, and emotions in dealing with anyone that matters. The implications of this approach are enormous. If spouses can learn to truly empathize with each other, their bond will  strenghten. Business people can use empathy to learn how to better serve their clients. Politicians can use empathy to effectively provide for the needs of their constituents. Teachers can be more effective; doctors more responsive to patients needs. Even lawyers would be more in tune with their client's needs. The Power of Empathy is very readable. You don't have to have a background in psychology to understand and appreciate this book. Dr. Ciaramicoli gives real life examples of the uses of empathy with references to the literature. His message is documented by many authoritative sources in science and the arts. Everyone- and I mean everyone- can profit from this masterwork. It is highly recommended! The gospel of The Power of Empathy must be spread throughout the world",1

Leslie clearly explains through biblical teaching and vulnerable, touching illustrations, that the pathway to joy is found in our humility and Christ-likeness.

"Like RV with Robin Williams it was funny, outrageous, different in every aspect (dysfuntional families), and heartwarming in the end.",0
A very funny book. Eric simply as a good sense of humor. The book reminds us of all the silly things we do when we fall in love like talking for hours together on the phone and half of those talks are utter nonsense. The book deals with a serious subject though where the authors prove thier point that only GOd can write a perfect love story for each of us. If we try our ways of finding true love we could be headed for trouble or even a heartache which can be avoided if we have God's clear direction in our lives. Eric writes about how he grew closer to Jesus and that made a difference in his life especially his relationship with his brother Mark. Finding love God's way is the only perfect way of a biblical romance and marriage. Try this book and you will never be disappointed.,1
"Rarely is a recording released that contains 10 potential hits. There is not a bad song on this CD. I remember having the LP back in the 70's when it was released. Linda Ronstadt has one of the most beautiful voices in all of music. This CD has up-tempo songs like ""You're No Good"" and ""When Will I Be Loved"" to the country classic ""I Can't Help It if I'm Still in Love with You"". The title track, ""Heart Like a Wheel"" is a beautiful ballad in Ronstadt's voice. This CD is certainly a classic for lovers of good music. It is highly recommended",0

"""Flashpoint"" is one of those films that pay cable channels put into heavy rotation after its initial release back in the 1980s and one that still occasionally turns up nowadays as one of those middle of the night flicks on TBS or TNT. I first saw it eons ago, and never forgot its conspiratorial tone and desert atmosphere. When I first started getting into DVD in a big way, I looked for this movie right from the start only to discover it had not yet crossed that oftentimes impassable gulf between digital video disc and VHS tape. It is the type of film I knew--through long and painful experience with big studios and their total disrespect for DVD technology--would only appear on a disc in a fullscreen format with little to no extras, and I was right. It is that obscure. Hopefully its recent reemergence will help this film find a whole new generation of fans. ""Flashpoint"" is a must watch film for anyone who enjoys the idea of seeing Kris Kristofferson, Treat Williams, Rip Torn, Kurtwood Smith, Jean Smart, and Miguel Ferrer in the same movie. O.k., a few of those names might not be a selling point, but it's still an intriguing film nonetheless.The American Southwest is an environment of sand, cactus, heat, and more heat. It's the sort of place where some people still think they live in the Old West, the sort of place where people keep to themselves. It's also a place where secrets can hide under the sand for decades without anyone the wiser. Such is the case in ""Flashpoint,"" a film where a dirty secret from some twenty odd years earlier is about to cause a whole lot of grief for a whole lot of people. Enter Logan (Kristofferson) and Ernie (Williams), two border patrol officers who spend their days roaming through the desert chasing illegal aliens. These two men couldn't be further apart in temperament and manner. Logan is a jaded Vietnam veteran and a once promising government employee who now thinks his job is a real drag. He's just putting in his time and trying not to make waves because he wants people to leave him alone. Ernie, however, is an idealistic younger guy who doesn't hesitate to stand up to injustice when he sees it. For example, an auto accident in town that claims the lives of several illegal aliens finds Ernie confronting the man responsible for smuggling people over the border. The two get along so well because they admire each other's personalities. Both men also form a bond over the latest shenanigans going on at the border patrol office. The bigwigs in Washington decide it's a great idea to bury thousands of computer-controlled sensors out in the desert to track the movements of the illegals, an idea that will cost agents their jobs. While burying one of these sensors, Logan discovers a jeep buried out in the desert. The skeletal remains of the driver, a driver's license, a box filled with fishing gear and a rifle, and nearly a million dollars in cash form the beginnings of a mystery that will bring about a mess of trouble. The driver's license is dated 1963. So is the money. And the story takes place in Texas. Do you see where this is going yet? Yep, Logan discovered someone involved with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The two officers don't know this at first, but soon will after Ernie insists on discovering this man's identity before he will agree to split town with the loot. Logan grudgingly obliges. Their investigation agitates Sheriff Wells (Rip Torn) and brings in the enigmatic federal agent Carson (Kurtwood Smith) and his goons. Ernie and Logan soon discover that they are facing something far bigger and more powerful than they are, something that won't hesitate to kill anyone in its path to keep the cover up in place. Lots of innocent people bite the dust by the time the credits roll.""Flashpoint"" is a great film, one of those great films largely ignored by both critics and the viewing public. Surprisingly, it's not the connection to the JFK assassination that makes the film as good as it is, although the scenes in which the two men begin to unravel the connection between the jeep and the crime are truly eerie. The film also never really explains the parameters of the conspiracy Ernie and Logan are up against except to hint that it's something large and powerful beyond belief, powerful to the point that it can kill law officers with ease and without any fear of interference. What does make the film a winner, aside from the wonderful performances of the principal actors, has a lot to do with the atmospheric desert environment. It is frightening to consider what secrets lie under the sand out in the middle of nowhere, and even more frightening to think the government knows what's hidden out there. That a cabal of powerful individuals could sweep into the desert and do whatever they want to anyone they want is an extremely horrific proposition, and one that works wonders in this movie. After all, it's awfully difficult to find witnesses out in the middle of the desert.""Flashpoint"" also boasts a great score from Tangerine Dream that perfectly meshes with the sweeping vistas and mountain backdrops. Sadly, the fullscreen transfer doesn't look too great, and the absence of extras really bothers me. I'm not one of these viewers who must listen to every commentary track or watch every little extra on a disc, but I sure would have appreciated seeing such things on a ""Flashpoint"" DVD. I'll endorse this Warner disc anyway since the movie is such a great way to spend a couple of hours. I'd like to see a special edition, though.      ",0
"The writer assumes that the reader is familiar with the artists and their muses. Mentions Dodgson and Carroll in the same sentence without saying they are the same person; the village of Cadaques without indicating which country it's in,etc. The chapters follow no timeline, jumping back and forth, describing events that preceed something previously mentioned. I mistakenly thought it was biographic, but there is a lot of the author's opinions and impressions in the text, guiding the reader (The careful reader will note that...), so that they arrive to her same conclusion. May be enjoyable by someone who already knows the protagonists' lives but not for someone trying to learn something for the first time",1
This is the best advice I ever received on health and I recommend it to everyone,1
"Seriously, at a certain point when I was around 18 or 19, this was my Bible, or my Little Red Book - I and a handful of friends (Warhol died at about the same time) took every syllable here very, very seriously.This is kinda funny to me now, but it's a great book still, a truly unique cultural artifact.  Warhol - as always maintains the trademark deadpan aloofness here, which had a few odd purposes beyond simply looking cool:  there were rare instances when he'd drop his guard and a hint of social relevance would enter the frame, which did run contrary to most of what Warhol did, here especially.  Doing so would turn art into something didactic, and - as a joke doesn't work if you have to explain the punch line, art flops if you have to lead your viewers, or readers, by the hand into your meaning.  Thus Warhol's stylish glibness and affected cool served a brilliant purpose - it made demands of everyone who came into contact with it.Here we have Warhol's epigrams - spread out like some artboy approximation of 'Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-Tung,' all about equally quotable, useless, devoid of literary merit, yet (unlike the leaden and ideologically bankrupt Chairman) also stylish and memorable, even at their most zoned out. The other great method behind Warhol's facades is here as well - the same impulse that turned canned soup into the artworks of a once very, very poor 2nd-generation immigrant's child (if you were going hungry, Campell's soup would in fact become, and possibly remain, a beautiful thing, and we all know that beautiful things are and always will be one of the most fitting of subjects for art).  These cryptic sayings and jottings all seem constructed to get us all to see the small stuff for what it is, and learn to appreciate it for that.Warhol was like Elvis - all things to all people.

"Art Garfunkel has always been one of my favorite solo artists.That is why I was absolutely flabbergasted to discover ""Across America"" at my local library.  For some strange reason, I was not even aware that this disc was ever released.  What makes that all the more remarkable is that my wife and I actually saw him in concert during his '96 summer tour when this ""live"" recording was made.  One can only conclude that this disc was not very widely promoted nor was it an especially big seller. But none of that matters much.  I found ""Across America"" to be a joyous experience featuring a varied menu of 16 wonderful tunes.  Not surprisingly, about half the songs are from Arthur's magical days with Paul Simon. Included are memorable versions of hits like ""Homeward Bound"", ""Scarborough Fair"" and ""Sounds of Silence"".  Then of course there is the remarkable ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" as only Art Garfunkel can sing it.  It still sends chills up and down my spine even to this day!  You will also find a number of tunes from Garfunkels solo career including ""Bright Eyes"" and the haunting ""All I Know"".  Add to that a neat duet with the legendary James Taylor and a memorable version of the Beatles ""I Will"" and you will begin to understand why I am so enthusiastic about this CD.  Art Garfunkel has always been a fan of 1950's rock and roll and doo wop so it is quite appropriate that the disc concludes with his version of the Jesse Belvin classic ""Goodnight My Love"".  Now I am not a big fan of ""live"" recordings.  But ""Across America"" is the exception to that rule and is destined for a special place on my CD shelf.  After a long and difficult day at work I can assure you that this is just what the doctor ordered.  So just sit back, relax and enjoy.  Whether this disc sold 1000 copies or 10,000,000 it is a winner in my eyes.  Highly recommended",0
"Director:  Turi MeyerCast:  Tony Todd, Donna D'Errico, Alexia Robinson, Jsu Garcia, Mark Adair-Rios, Lupe Ontiveros, Elizabeth Guber, Rena Riffel, Ernie Hudson Jr.Running Time:  93 minutesRated R for bloody violence and gore, sexuality and language.The third in the series derived from a concept by Clive Barker, ""Day of the Dead"" (they can't even come up with their own subtitle) staggers down the well-trodden path already navigated by the ""Halloween"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies: that is, taking a decent concept and flushing it down the toilet. The original movie was a near horror masterpiece and relied on atmosphere rather than gore, while the first sequel was bearable if completely routine. This one is just a load of rubbish.  Donna D'Errico, from Baywatch (what a spectacle of credibility), stars as Caroline McKeever, the great great granddaughter of the feared Candyman (Tony Todd once again), once a normal man but now an apparition who appears to slaughter everyone around you if you dare to say his name five times in front of a mirror.  Caroline says his name five times in front of a mirror and up he pops to murder her nearest and dearest. As the Candyman hacks his way through various bad actors, Caroline teams up with new pal David (Nick Corri) to find a collection of paintings knocked up by the Candyman while he was still alive, which may hold the key to stopping him. There's not a single thing here that isn't scavenged from the first ""Candyman"" film and every other ropy horror movie produced since caveman days. The screenplay is so lazy it can't even be bothered to connect half the characters to the plot, the photography is bright and glossy, which is at odds with what's supposed to be a dark story, while nothing in the direction adds any atmosphere at all. Anyone could have directed this movie, so little effort has been put in to make it scary, while the ending is an outrageous cop out. No thought has gone in to developing themes or structuring the plot because no one here is talented enough to give this movie any depth beyond having D'Errico running around in a variety of tight vests.  The rest of the performances are poor too, although none are quite as bad as D'Errico's pathetic attempts at screaming and breathing erratically.  Surely more can be done with characters like the Candyman than the constant repetition of scenes where he appears to stick his hook through someone's stomach.  The fact that the makers of this movie think Candyman is so terrifying that the very sight of him just standing there will strike fear into our hearts is a sign that they just can't be bothered even to try something a bit different.  Clive Barker may not be the master of horror as every at first claimed him to be, but he's right about one thing: the sequels to his movies are garbage",0

"Night and Fog is only about 30 minutes long but it manages to move one deeply by the time its conclusion is reached.  I must share with the reader that this, without qualification, is a superlative documentary on the Holocaust.  The narration is full of judgment and condemnation--which is entirely appropriate in light of its subject matter.  The footage is both in color and black and white.  Most of what one sees of Auschwitz and the other concentration camps (KZ) was shot by the vilianous NAZIs themselves.  The meticulous books that they kept are revealed about half-way through; with the names of the dead crossed out in red pencil. Although I must say that I am quite familiar with the Holocaust, many of the clips in Night and Fog were previously unknown to me.  Indeed, the decapitation device and the piled heads alongside it were a shock.  As a side note, while watching this, I could not help but think of the fact that a movie like this could not be made in France today because it is a society plagued by anti-semitism.  That's a tragedy as Resnais's work is beyond impressive.  We need another thousand documentaries of this quality.  This is a historical artifact and it's absolutely worth your purchase.  In fact, I may go and watch it a second time. ",0

"We could hardly wait to get this release as John McDermott has been delighting family and friends for years with his music. On this album, he has recorded an inspiring mix of treasured hymns and comforting contemporary spiritual songs.

Mom is still thrilled over ""Abide With Me"" while my other favorites include ""How Deep the Father's Love for Us,"" ""My Forever Friend,"" ""Be Not Afraid,"" and ""Lord of the Dance."" As always, I have also learned from John...he has recorded SIX verses for ""Amazing Grace"" So as I said, better buy several copies.

"Outsiders familiar with Spokane will tell you it is a strange and sometimes unfair place.  This book, along with Jack Olson's &quot;Son&quot;, can in some measure tell you *why* this is so.  Like that other classic work of true crime, the plot concerns specific events and individuals who for a long time &quot;get away with&quot; horrific if somewhat pathetic offences.  Behind that story, however, the setting takes on a character of its own, and so you learn not only of crooked cops but of a community's perverse will to look the other way until all hope of justice is ready to die with the last witness.  In the end, the truth may be revealed but does not necessarily prevail",1
"After a nearly five year absence, Jackie McLean's ""Right Now"" makes a welcome return to the Blue Note catalog in the RVG series.  Why Jackie Mac's various Blue Note sessions from 1964-66 never received more notice will always baffle me.  In fact, many of them weren't even issued until the 1970s.  At least Alfred Lion realized that this January 29, 1965 session had to be put out ""Right Now.""  Jackie always had a talent for grooming young talent, as he basically introduced the jazz world to the likes of Grachan Moncur III, Bobby Hutcherson and most importantly Tony Williams.  On ""Right Now,"" it is pianist Larry Willis (who joins bassist Bob Cranshaw and drummer Clifford Jarvis), a phenomenal player who, had he arrived on the scene even a few years earlier, certainly would have been given his own Blue Note date as a leader.  His contributions to this album are multi-faceted, including authoring two of its compositions, ""Christel's Time"" and the heartbreaking ""Poor Eric"" for Dolphy.  Framing these two brilliant tracks are the album's fiery, searching opener, McLean's ""Eco,"" and one of the catchiest Blue Note tunes I've ever encountered, the Charles Tolliver penned title track, which closes the set.  Fans of Jackie Mac and great Blue Note discs should buy ""Right Now"" right now",0

"I recommend this book for the rich and colorful depiction of Britain during the 5th century, as well as for providing an intelligent version of Arthurian beginnings. Full Review:Having read just about every version of the Arthurian legend, I picked up Jack Whyte's book: The Skystone, hoping to find something more definitive and less magical. What I discovered, was an extremely well written and historically fascinating look at 5th century life in Roman occupied Britain. Whyte did his homework, and it shows in so many ways. Not only does he evince a formidable knowledge and understanding of Rome's military men, but also of the impact the Empire had on the entire known world. His explanation for the sword Excalibur's beginnings makes sense, and includes magic-if only for the way it appeared to primitive eyes. Whyte, like another author, Colleen McCullough, takes no shortcuts, nor opts for facile answers to the legend of Arthur, and the birth of Camelot. Instead, he patiently builds, step by step, a plausible yet highly entertaining historical setting. General Caius Brittanicus is a brilliant and highly decorated Roman man, who was born in Britain. A man of deep insight and wisdom, he forsees the collapse of the Roman Empire. When not on campaign for Rome, he lives with his wife, children and widowed sister Luceia. Publius Varro is General Brittanicus' Primus Pilus, or senior aide. Their fortunes are inextricably entwined, and how the two of them grow deep in love and respect for one another, is the main thrust of the first book. Varro, has a blade fashioned from what his grandfather described as a skystone. This sword has a sheen, and luster ordinary iron doesn't possess, and is much stronger than even bronze. Yet Publius has no idea where to find more of this strange metal. When he finally does find it, the answer fulfills many empty spaces left by less gifted writers. The battle scenes are interesting, even to those of us who might ordinarily find them boring, mainly due to Whyte's deft handling of Roman military tactics. The enmities that develop through the events in this book, prove to have far reaching and unforeseen consequences. The Skystone comes with a glossary, a pronunciation guide and maps of Britain, which prove helpful throughout the series. I thoroughly enjoyed this book for its interesting and deep characters, all drawn with a loving hand, that understands human nature in all its dimensions so well. I recommend starting with The Skystone and reading the entire series. You'll be delighted and totally enmeshed in Jack Whyte's version of Arthurian times. ",1

"_Colors: The Story of Dyes and Pigments_, is an excellent little book to read if you are interested in colors.  It covers pre-history up through the modern era, and it discusses some of the chemistry, much of the mineralogy, and a lot of the economics & politics that went into the use of different dyes & pigments through the eons. It is also lavishly illustrated, with many many photos, including photos of famous works of art, close-up photos showing artistic techniques, photos of artists' materials, and photos of historical treatises relating to cloth dyeing and other skills.  There is a lot of good technical content, including explanations of the differences between dyes, pigments and lakes, and details of attempts in antiquity to create artificial colors, going as far back as the Egyptians.The chapters are Painting & Dyeing, which covers paints and dyes from antiquity to the Middle Ages; Colors in the Middle Ages, which covers new technological & economic developments in the Middle Ages; The Explosion of Supply and Demand, which covers how the increased trade of the Renaissance, Enlightenment Era, and the Industrial Age drove the search for new colors; and The Triumph of Industrial Chemistry, which describes how colors are made today.  There is also a chapter titled Documents, which has excerpts from a number of historical works about dyes & pigments, and that chapter alone is worth the price of the book.  The bibliography is also excellent.It was a bit slow in places, and since it was originally written in French, there is a certain flow to the text that is subtly different from many contemporary books written by native English speakes.  But, the differences are not unpleasant, and for the most part the text is very engaging.I did notice that it repeats the statement that India Yellow was made from the concentrated urine of cows who at only mangoes, and according to Victoria Finlay in _Color: A Natural History of the Palette_, that provenance is mythical.  But that was the only jarring note I found in the entire work",1

"This is an excellent adaptation by the Merchant-Ivory-Jhabvala team of the E.M. Forster novel of the same name. It centers around two sisters: one (Emma Thompson) befriends an older woman (Vanessa Redgrave), owner of the country estate Howards End; the other (Helena Carter) befriends a young clerk (Sam West) who has high aspirations. After Redgrave dies, Thompson ends up marrying her widower (Anthony Hopkins). Carter gets pregnant by West, who is later attacked and killed by Hopkins's son (James Wilby). Class distinctions are explored, especially in terms of culture (as depicted by Thompson and Carter) vs. materialism (Hopkins and Redgrave). But the real theme is the moral and intellectual vapidity of the upper Edwardian class of manners - a way of life already (1910) very much in decay, and that would be utterly wiped out in the trenches of the Marne in a few short years. Faithful to the novel in plot, it avoids some of Forster's symbolic representations as well as his main idea of the need for people to ""connect"" with one another. The movie won a number of Oscars, and the performances by all the actors are first-rate. Extremely well done all around.",0
"""The Life Pursuit"" shows how Murdoch and the band has really extended their songwriting abilities in the last few years.  They are able to work in different styles, do a greater variety of things within a style, and write more complex songs that also have more continuity and longer melodies than their work from the 90s (which I still love).  I also like how instrumentals are becoming more important to their music.  So technically, this is their best album yet.  But great music is about emotion and engagement as well as technique (one without the other is just not enough) and on this level I just have to say I LOVE the album.  The radiance of ""Another sunny day"" is captivating and the long, flowing, seamless melody is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship.  I think the main melody from ""We are the sleepyheads"" (love the title) is maybe the most complex melody ever from B&S -- just great work.  And maybe my favorite song of all is ""Dress up in you"" -- soft, sweet, heartrending (but not in a sad way).  I haven't even mentioned some really strong efforts like ""White Collar Boy"" and ""The Blues are still blue.""  And ""To be myself completely"" really hits me in the heart (although I really wish they'd have chosen a different singer).  Also worth mentioning are the very clever lyrics.I do have some criticisms.  As usual, the singing is amateurish.  My wife and I -- both big fans -- have repeatedly expressed the desire that B&S write the songs -- something they are very, very good at -- and turn them over to crack musicians for the recording.  At least, upgrade the vocal performances, which are below the mediocre level!  And not all the songs are up to the best stuff (""Mornington Crescent"" is boring, ""Song for Sunshine"" is a 70s remake which is OK but I think they should have upped the tempo by about 50%).That said, this is a terrific album and my favorite B&S ever.  It's nice to know that a band one loves is doing better work than they were a decade ago.  Highly recommended",0

"This paint-by-numbers New Zealand film is a rote Coming-of-Age / Adultery flick in which a family living by the seaside is put in moral jeopardy by a handsome stranger. Throughout the film, I kept asking myself how the parents in this nuclear unit could spend so much time at their dream house without working a steady job. Instead, it appears that everyone involved has far too much time on their hands and found that drinking themselves into oblivion will only do so much to ease the boredom.Yes, Mom (Sarah Perise) has a booze problem and the hots for the boat-bound stranger (Marton Csokas). Meanwhile, Dad (Alistair Browning) sits cuckolded in the back yard sipping hard liquor. Their two kids (Alicia Fulford-Wierzbicki and Aaron Murphy) don't have healthy hobbies either; spending their time cutting private parts out of porn magazines and taping them to their bodies. I suppose there is a lot of ""higher meaning"" going on between these ""adult parts"" and the lemon tree that grows in their back yard. However, I really wasn't inclined to dig deep in this overly glossy film whose plot and ending were visible from the onset.Director Jeffs muddies her water with an overabundance of slow motion shots, drawing out the tedium of RAIN. Instead of treading new ground, the film provides the audience with trite morality and one-dimensional characters",0

"I must confess that I had a negative bias towards this book when I started reading. I like good hard rock music, or classical music like Bach, and I find much of the new worship music rather dull and uncreative. Moreover, the lyrics are often theologically lame or misleading.After a few chapters some sympathy for the author was awoken. Zschech is honest about (some of her) mistakes and problems, and it didn't sound too easy to be Darlene Zscech.Sympathy and biases aside - well maybe not 100 % objetivity will follow... Theologically, Zschech seems to assume a charismatic, evangelical Christianity, influenced by the Word Faith movement. It's a bit vague, since the theology is often only assumed, not described let alone argued. Christians know what they believe, seems to be the assumption, and what is needed is dedication. The question a Christian should ask him- or herself is how much they are willing to worship God. How much are you prepared to sacrifice? From these preconditions (no outlined theology and focus on our service) one easily falls into some form of legalism.Zschech mixes our work and God's. Our worship seems to be inevitibly blended with God's love. The lyrics in ""Shout to the Lord"" is no coincidence: ""All of my days I want to praise, the wonders of your mighty love"". The relationship between God's acts and our worship is even reversed, when Zschech says that God acts as a response to our worship. (Granted, some Bible verses are given to support this view, this is definitely not the general thrust of the Bible.) When we praise God, God acts. This also turnes praise into prayer, in an odd way. Shouldn't praise be a response to what God *has* done (Rev. 4:4; 5:9-10)? If we want God to do something, shouldn't we simply pray?In this book we can read about a showbusiness spirit, look-at-me spirit, and creating an atmosphere of faith. This kind of hyper-spirituality is not based on the Bible, and tends to ascribe our human faults and sins to spirits (cf. James 1:14). The focus on atmosphere (here and now) may make us somewhat overlook the objectivity of the Gospel and salvation.What I really miss in this book, is what i percieve as true worship. When believers together sing about and give praise to God for salvation through Jesus' death and resurrection - without any other motives than that. In order to have such worship, Hillsong first would need a sound theology. And in order to have good corporate worship, the ""intimacy"" of the music and lyrics would have to change since they also tend to make the songs individualistic.Instead of this book, I would recommend Vaughan Roberts chapter ""The Place of Music and Singing in Church"", which can be found in his book ""True Worship"" or on the internet",1

"If you love Ludlum's over-the-top novels (and I do), The Matarese Circle has to be up there with the best. Not all of Ludlum's books are a good match of plot and style -- the repeated &quot;Oh my God!&quot; declamations of one character after another can get silly when the goings-on aren't as riveting as they could be (the two Bourne sequels suffer from this problem, I think.) But Circle delivers on all fronts. Part One is a masterpiece all by itself -- the intricate cat-and-mouse game between Talienkov and Scofield plays out thrillingly. And these are two of Ludlum's most believably drawn characters; we feel empathy for both, and root for them to join forces from the get-go. Antonia Gravet, the inevitable gorgeous heroine/love interest who surfaces in Part Two, brings a well-crafted and believable backstory to the plot. One final bonus: some of Ludlum's zestiest minor characters appear in this book, adding to the fun in nearly every chapter.",1

"This is a great game that is made very well.  It is nice and solid wood construction with great bright colors.  It will last us many years.  I bought it for a small carnival style fundraising event that we needed games for children to play.  It will surely be a hit!  My daughter (8 years old) tried it out and really enjoyed playing with it.  It has three bean bags of different weights making the game differing in difficulty.  I would recommend this game to any one looking for entertainment for children.  This game is best played on a table, so that a child can stand and throw the bean bags",0
"Highlights include... (My comments in parentheses.)  Compassionate societies never create fatherless and motherless families.  A same-sex family is never the answer to a child's developmental problems.  (One way to inoculate a fatherless child from the ill-effects of not having a father is for society to have a clear idea of what a good father is.  Same-sex marriage denies even that benefit to the fatherless.) The push for same-sex families will subject generations of children to an uncontrolled, ill-advised social experiment to meet the ""needs"" of homosexual adults.  (Children will be but ""trophies"" that symbolize achievement of a certain status for anxious gays working out psychological issues---the same way one sometimes sees a luxury automobile parked in front of a run-down shack--- an ""aspirin on wheels."")  Homosexual adoption is not necessary to provide homes for orphaned children.  Same-sex marriage is not about providing rights or physical resources to children.  No child in a same-sex family would ever ask, ""Why don't we have the same rights as other families.""  Instead, they ask ""Why don't I have a daddy?"" or ""Why don't I have a mommy?""  (There are many heterosexual families looking to adopt children, but the legal system often interferes, making some children practically ""unadoptable."")  Male and female are not ""Mr. Potato Heads"" where the cores are all the same and only the externals are different.  Gender matters.Endorsements of same-sex families by professional organizations are traceable to gay activism, not science.  (Scientists are ill-equipped to deal with the philosophical and emotional arguments used by gay activists--- so they ""cave."")A common challenge of same-sex family proponents is ""how does my family situation hurt you.""  (I would use the illustration of currency.  One person counterfeiting a $20 bill doesn't appreciably depreciate a genuine $20 bill--- but an initiative to make monopoly money equal to legal tender would have enormous impact.  The push for gay marriage makes counterfeit relationships equal to legitimate ones and diminishes every marriage)Traditional marriage has huge public benefits backed up by overwhelming scientific evidence.  Homosexual marriage will have enormous, negative public consequences.  (If homosexuality were held to the same standard of public harm as smoking, there would be no public debate.  Instead, we would have attorneys general of the states bringing lawsuits that would eventually bankrupt pro-homosexual organizations.)Arguments for same-sex marriage also break down barriers to other kinds of marriage.  The first couple in line in Massachusetts for a same-sex marriage license had an ""open relationship.""  (In recognizing same-sex marriage, society will have leap-frogged over polygamy into a more radical form of sexual relationship.  Consistency will demand legalization of polygamy since it's less extreme than what will have already been accomplished in allowing gays to marry.) The debate over same-sex marriage has been poisoned by name calling.  Concerns about gay marriage cannot be reduced simply to ""homophobia.""  Many gays recognize the social harm gay marriage would bring and are therefore against gay marriage.Gay advocates conflate same-sex marriage with interracial marriage--- but saying ""I have a mommy who's a (particular race)"" is radically different than saying ""I have a mommy who's a man.""If legalized, same-sex marriage will not just be acceptable in public schooling; it will be relentlessly indoctrinated.  (Humans have a perverse impulse to ""worship"" the unnatural.) Promotion of traditional marriage will eventually be labeled as ""hate speech"" if same-sex marriage becomes legal.  We've already seen it in Sweden and in Canada.Authors: Glen Stanton is director of social research and cultural affairs, and senior analyst for marriage and sexuality, at Focus on the Family, based in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

"this encycolpedic oeuvre is almost overwhelming in its sheer scale; however, the attention to detail is necessary in order to understand how this horrifying portion of liturgical history developed. social contexts and authentic resources make this a very thorough history of the inquisition as it was experienced in spain. i only wish i could find an equally thorough treatment of the inquisition in italy and france. a very revealing work for the lay person who wants to know more about liturgical history, the woman's place in medieval social order, and the development of the social relationships among medieval spanish christians, jews, and muslims",1

"I wasn't sure whether this book or ""Journey Through the Ice Age"" by Paul G. Bahn would be better, so I bought them both. It turns out that they are both excellent books. Both are loaded with color photographs of artifacts famous and less well-known. Both have scholarly, informative text, considering anthropological and historical contexts, the techniques and materials used by the artists, the history of the study of prehistoric art, and plenty of cautious speculation about the functions the art had to its artists' communities. They are organized quite differently: Bahn's moves from topic to topic: chapter 7 is on portable art, chapter 8 on rock shelters and cave art, chapter 9 on outdoors art, and so on. But White's book has a regional arrangement: chapter 4 is on Western Europe, chapter 5 is on Central and Eastern Europe and Sibera, chapter 6 is on Africa, the Near East and Anatolia, and so on. Obviously you can see that White's book has more of a global focus than Bahn's. In fact, Bahn's third chapter deals with prehistoric art outside of Europe; in every other chapter he focuses on European art, especially the caves. Although Bahn's book devotes a chapter to ""Portable Art"" such as jewelry and miniature statues (including the famous ""Venus figurines""), White's book has a far superior coverage. On the other hand, Bahn has better coverage of interesting issues such as how to reproduce prehistoric art for public enjoyment, dating issues, and forgeries. If you are primarily interested in European cave art and will be content with a glance at the rest of the world, then Bahn's book is better for you. Personally, although Bahn deals with some interesting issues that White neglects, ultimately I prefer White's global perspective; further, I appreciate his introductory comments about modern Western art and cultural assumptions, and consideration of what might be universal in human art. Incidently, when it comes to books about art, for some reason I prefer hardcover to paperback; and at this time White's book in hardcover is available at great discount on Amazon, making it almost as inexpensive as Bahn's. So, my preference is clear. However, I want to emphasize that despite my partiality to White's book, they are certainly both excellent, and I do not think one of them is clearly, inherently better than the other. It just depends on what you are looking for",1

"Another masterpiece from Donaldson.  Pick it up and READ it.... if you like it try out his other books.      The story of Angus and Morn  continues, even more gripping and well developed than in the first book.   Like The Real Story, there is bleakness and desolation, but they only serve  to highlight the characters.  The extremes that they are forced to  experience shape them and make them believable as individuals, and make  this book very dramatic and powerful.  You are brought to understand and  care about the characters, and by the end you will find yourself looking on  to the next book.   After reading this book I went out and bought the rest  of the series.... I had no fears about being disappointed by any of the  books, and I wasn't.  Two other people in my family were hooked on this  series as well, once I showed it to them(they almost strangled me for  losing the third book :) ",1

"Who hasn't been inside one of these cesspools of filth? I cannot lower myself enough to shop inside these dumps. Upon entering one of these airline hangars of slave labor, I am overcome with sympathy for the poor (usually elderly) person paid to ""greet"" you at the door, as if that is supposed to engender warmth, of walking into a humble abode. After that begins an auditory, visual and olfactory assault upon the senses. The stink of fast food wafts throughout. Filthy, dirty floors being trod upon by barefoot parents and their screaming, woebegone rats, uh, I mean children. Cheap, imported sweatshop merchandise scattered EVERYWHERE. In order to create some semblance of dignity for their employees, they are called ""associates"" (oooh, like a law firm! when can I start!). Their television ads are godawful, always trying to look like a hip place to shop - which they will NEVER be. I do not mean entirely to mock those who shop there. In fact these scum merchants may be what allows them to survive day to day. It is a vicious cycle.

"I have to say that I was floored by this new Josh Groban CD...FLOORED !! I have the previous two, and the growth displayed in this new one is hard to measure. The courage it must have take for him to leave the familiar and comfortable world of the 'safe' and venture into S.A. music (Weeping), the world of funk and groove (the Herbie Hancock offering), the etherial and haunting Now or Never with Imogen Heap (!!!) and his own February Song, it's hard to fathom. And beyond the wonderful orchestrations and interesting melodic twists, he also revisits one of his strongest suits, interpreting romantic and often sad ballads in Spanis and Italian. The future is so bright for this artist I can't imagine where he'll be in 10 years, but I hope it's Broadway, but only after he conquers the world. Nobody I've ever followed as a musician works as hard as this man does to bring this unique style and open emotional 'converstation' with his listening public (and he has a huge one already). Bravo Mr. Groban and don't change a thing, you're on the right track, your OWN track and I cannot wait to see where it takes you, and us your avid listening public. The DVD is wonderful, the 'making of' Awake goes into the studio with Josh and the producers and the photoshoot/video shoot footage is hilarious, the guy is so relaxed and so naturally funny, it's very entertaining.Favorites? February Song, L'ultima Notte, Lullaby/Weeping, Machine and definitely Now or Never with a bullet ",0

"Trevor Pinnock and the English Concert perform Mozart's symphonies with great style, elan, and spirit, making this the best period orchestra Mozart Symphonies around.  Pinnock deals alot in contrasts and atmosphere, setting a mood for each movement, within each symphony.  The English Concert plays  even Mozart's earliest symphonies-written when he was a pre-teen-as great music, and it works, very effectively.  Allegros bristle with spirit, Andantes and Adagios emphasize cantabile (singing style) as all Mozart's music has a vocal/singing emphasis (in contrast to Haydn or Beethoven, who tend to build movements arount motives, or rhythmic patterns of notes;  Mozart emphasizes melody moreso in many of his works).I am not a fan of period instruments in music of Haydn, Mozart, and any composers after Bach and Handel, but this cycle is really fine.  My favorite Mozart Symphonies have been Karl Bohm/Berlin Philharmonic (complete cycle, DG);  21-41 by Joseph Krips/Concertgebouw Orchestra (Philips, coupled with Marriner/Academy of St. Martin in the fields for 1-20); Bruno Walter/New York Philharmonic for Symphonies 25,28,29,35,36,38-41 (Sony); Otto Klemperer/Philharmonia for Symphonies 36,38-41 (EMI).   But, Pinnock's accounts are spirited and the English Concert, at about 20-25 players, doesn't sound scrawny or ineffective at all.  If you're used to the sonority of the Berlin Philharmonic or Philharmonia Orchestra, this will take some getting used to, but it is very good.This could be called ""period instrument Mozart for those who don't like period instruments.""  I have heard Christopher Hogwood/Academy of Ancient Music in Symphonies 34,38,39,41, and they are not as good as Pinnock's accounts.  Hogwood's orchestra sounds small, puny compared with Pinnock's more robust group.   I am not meaning to degrade Hogwood, as I have a number of fine recordings of his: Beethoven Symphonies 1,2;Handel's MESSIAH; Haydn Symphonies 94, 96; Boyce Opus 6 Symphonies.  But in Mozart Symphonies, I prefer Pinnock.Pinnock's set is also well recorded, adding to it's high quality.  You can't go wrong with these, unless you absolutely hate period instruments",0

"How To Say It To Seniors: Closing The Communication Gap With Our Elders by David Solie (an expert in geriatric psychology and the CEO/Medical Director of""Second Opinion"", a life insurance brokerage corporation) is a practical and accessible guide to communicating effectively with older adults. Author David Solie provides invaluable insights and practical advice to gaining the trust and cooperation of the elderly, offering assistance to them without ""taking over"" the conversation, understanding the need of ""legacy"" with respect to the elderly, and learning how to listen and what to listen for. While especially recommended to professionals and para-professionals working with the elderly in matters ranging from business, to health, to daily living, How To Say It To Seniors is also of immense value to non-specialist general readers wanting to talk more effectively and to greater purpose with their own elderly parents, family members, friends, neighbors, and acquaintances.",1
"I purchased this book after seeing the 5-star reviews.  I was so disappointed after reading it that I checked the reviews again to make sure I'd purchased the correct book.  I shared it with ten of our holiday party guests to invite their feedback before giving it to my children in case I was somehow missing something indeed worthy of praise.  All agreed that this was a disturbing book for children that serves more to add to their existing ideas of what's scary, has no advice on dealing with these fears and offers nothing to promote their self-confidence.  After reading the book without realizing any of us were discussing it, my teen nephew even commented ""wow, this is downer.""  It's being returned.  There are far better books to purchase",1
"This is another excellent book from Karl Schroeder, but what I was most impressed by in this book was a truly new idea - Science Fiction aficionados are all familiar with the concept of the Dyson sphere, where all non-solar material in a system is used to create a giant sphere with a 1 A.U. diameter where people live on the unimaginably vast inner surface.   The problem with Dyson spheres is that at our current level of technology and understanding of strength of materials, we don't know how to build one.  Schroeder solves this by making a sphere of only planetary diameter, with a skin of ice and a contained atmosphere, which puts this fantastic concept well within the realm of possibility.  Take ""Ringworld"" and mix with ""The Integral Trees"", throw in a rip-roaring good hard-science based storyline, and you've got a formula for success",1

Lester Ballard is a deeply deranged and demented individual with sexually perverse lusts that resides in the Eastern Tennessee countryside. He's accused of rape, imprisoned for a short time, then released after which he commits unspeakable acts against his fellow man. It's doubtful his incarceration had anything to do with his behavior since it's obvious from the start this man is troubled. This is a wonderful novel filled with effective imagery and stunning descriptiveness. I found the chapter where the town sheriff, deputy and old Mr. Wade rowing the boat through the flooded town streets to be quite interesting. A recommended book, but beware the subject matter is quite graphic and might not be suitable for those without strong stomachs",1

"I received this book as a gift from a teacher girlfriend. At first I was overwhelmed-it's a big book. My friend told me to trust her, pick a page (any page), gather my kids and start. I am glad I did.I started with an interview titled ""All the Senses"". As an introduction, my 5 and 7 year olds and I talked about what our senses were. Then I interviewed them, writing down both of their answers to questions about their favorites smells, sounds, sensations, sights...in the same book. The kids liked having this ""talking time"" with me. After a few minutes, my husband, overhearing us, stopped doing the dishes and joined us so he could listen too. In our family, the temptation is to just get things done in the evening. This book helps my husband and me spend just 10 or 20 precious minutes really talking and communicating with the kids. It's easy. It's fun and together we're creating a keepsake treasure. I recommend it to parents everywhere. ",1

Gina Rowlands plays the submissive, protective wife wonderfully.  If you are of Mediterranean background, you will definitely enjoy this movie!!  If not, you will still enjoy a lot of laughs...although there is a very sad part near the end...get the Kleenex out, sit back and enjoy this movie with the entire family.  Alla famiglia!",0

"Jean Elshtain is Spellman Professor of Philosophy and Political Ethics at The University of Chicago.  Her book presents a history of views on democracy in contemporary and prior times.  One of the most interesting  examples of this feature of the book is her theater debate between Plato and Lincoln.  Drawing on her knowledge of Plato and Lincoln, Elshtain pits Plato's  argument against democracy against Lincoln's argument for it. Lincoln was committed to the peoples' capacities to make decisions necessary for a democracy to function, even where other approaches might be more efficient for choosing a path to follow.  Elshtain also makes the case for compromising, behavior that is necessary to a form of governance in which citizens  of diverse viewpoints must reconcile differences to make government work for the society.  The book is very timely. It puts a large perspective about the recently concluded election in which President Clinton's advocates argued that he is a genius at compromisae, and his opponents  stated that he vascilates too much",1
"For years I have wanted to read a comprehensive history of this period, which is far less well covered than the Renaissance and Enlightenment.  To cover a gap in my knowledge, I believe that this is a near ideal text for a variety of reasons.  The reformation, the author proves, must be taken into account in order to understand the world today. First, the author evokes the context from which the Reformation sprung:  directly from the Renaissance, with its scholarly questioning of the essential texts and the intellectual world that it opened up.  But there was also the aging feudal model, which aristocrats were trying to preserve as the modern state began to emerge with the consolidation of power of the absolutist monarchies, taking away their independence of action; this created a natural pool of allies for opposition to the Papacy, which tended to naturally support the divine right of kings (with many exceptions, of course, as this is over-generalising).Second, in an incredible feat of ongoing exposition, the author explains what people were believing/thinking at the time and how this released the violent passions that shook Europe and led to uncountable deaths.  This is a realm completely alien to me, who was brought up entirely without religion - it is whether the faithful believe that the eucharist actually embodies the blood of Christ, symbolises it, or is a papist-inspired blasphemy; whether a baptism should be at birth or later in life; whether a person can be saved by redemption in Christ's forgiveness, is innately predestined to God's kingdom, or is granted it by faith (and ritual) alone; the nature of Mary's divinity or lack thereof; etc.  People were executed and burnt alive for one opinion of the other, and the author explains why and how.  This was by far the most interesting and surprising part of the book for me:  it proves how much ideas mattered then, not as a mere epiphenomenon as we tend to view it today, but an actual motivator for choice.Third, MacCulloch does not shrink from explaining how these ideas were used in the political context of the time, across Europe but also in the new world.  This makes for extraordinarily dense reading, from why Ferdinand and Isabelle ejected the Jews from Moorish Spain as they liberated it in 1492, to Queen Elizabeth I's struggles to consolidate power in England, to the unsuccessful military campaigns of the prince of Transylvania to take over Poland.  In particular, he explains why Martin Luther allied himself with rebellious princes against the peasant uprisings, which were ruthlessly smashed:  he needed their protection and they needed his ideological independence, in spite of the peasants' taking inspiration directly from Luther's preachings.  It is a dazzling historical tour that whets the appetite for more, which I cannot do justice to here in such a succinct charaterization.  MacCulloch demonstrates how religious concerns intertlaced into many of the powerplays that one knows about, such as Louis XIV's attacks on the Netherlands.Finally, the author examines the impact of the Reformation, not only on daily life, but as a grand historical movement.  It is here that in many ways the most can be learned about how the various christian churches (and entire cultural identities) evolved and adapted into their present forms.  For example, the US is portrayed as an embodiment of the protestant ideal in a new geographical context, which supposedly explains the far higher identification of its citizens with the church today than their paradoxically more laic counterparts in such catholic countries as France and Italy.  He even looks, in what I interpreted as an existential psychoanalysis, at the psychology of fundamentalism, with pointed observations about the post 9/11 world.  This too stimulates me to delve deeper into Muslim history and contemprary religious movements.If I have any criticism, it is that MacCulloch covers such a vast and sweeping movement that the reader can get lost in the details about who did what and believed what.  But then, that is the nature of the subject and I do not see how he could have done otherwise without oversimplifying things.Warmly recommended as a great and deep reading experience.  ",1
"I have loved every minute of every Adelma Simmons book I have ever read.  This lovely lady is the owner and operator of Caprilands Herb Farm in Connecticut, which is the subject of this book.  She describes how the garden looks, smells, tastes and is cared for in the &quot;five&quot; seasons of a year--winter, spring, summer, fall and Christmas!  Yes, at Caprilands Christmas is a major event.  The book is packed with tips on gardening, using herbs and herbal folklore, all interspersed with personal anecdotes and humor. Check out all Adelma's books!  They are all fascinating",1
"In this book the authors outline unique and useful steps to making yourself financially free.  Using the 'Financial Freedom' number to determine how far you currently are from 'Infinite Wealth' is a very interesting paradigm-shift in most people's thinking, and one that I definitely recommend. Once you know how far you are from financial freedom, you can then work to implement the money-making strategies explained in the rest of the book.  These, coupled with high-quality professional advice, should see you on the path to financial freedom in very little time",1
"After reading a couple of other reviews about the &quot;quality&quot; of transfer on this dvd, I decided I wanted this in my collection. What I THOUGHT would be good or atleast a decent enough picture quiality, I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED.THE QUALITY OF TRANSFER OF THE PICTURE IS HORRIBLE!!! A great movie a total real diaster flick in picture quality. Non anamorphic, deffintaly not remastered or digitally transfered. Picture tones are very, very bad, along with what little color that is desplayed. Almost a black &amp; white picture with most of the entire movie too dark to make out what is going on. Even with my brightness turn all the way up on my tv, it still was so dark it almost wasn't worth continue watching.The ONLY things positive on this dvd was the fact it was in widescreen and &quot;suppossedly&quot; in Dolby Digital EX. The beginning Dolby intoduction was deffinatly in Dolby and had good sound but the movie itself didn't distributeand Dolby sounds that I could make out on my theatre sound system. Sounded like mono to me.Thsi dvd reproduction stinks and I suggest those that are into quality dvd and getting you money worth saty away from this &quot;Goodtimes Video&quot; version untill it is put on dvd correctly. Why they botherd is beyond me. Because I wanted to have a copy of this movie in widescreen, I am taping it on to VHS for my collection and going to try and return it for something better tommorrow. I suppsoe I'll have to be content that I got the widscreen version on VHS for now untill they re-release it on dvd with better quality, or they show it on tv in widescreen which I highly doubt. Heck, even TAPING IT OFF TV YOU'D GET A BETTER PICTURE QUALITY THAN THIS DVD",0
"Where to begin, I have been a DM for it seems like eons, at least 10 years.  In that time I have played DnD 1st edition, 2nd edition, and 3rd edition.  Also I have played Palladium Fantasy, and Rifts, White Wolf's vampire and Exalted and Mage, Marvel Superheroes RPG 1st TSR edition, and Fuzion, Fudge and well you get the idea, basically everything that exists.  In all that time I have never seen anything so easy to use and yet so great and all encompassing as BESM.  This game system is very easy to use and can still simulate anything at all that you can think up.  The game system is also very flexable and stable meaning that it is very easy to compare character's relative power levels.  This might not sound like much but trust me it is. Also what really sold me is the fact that you can create Anything!  A God or an intelligent football, anything!  It's the best go get it and try it at once",1

"The macaroni & cheese is KILLER - literally. TONS of fat stuff..yummmmm.  I mixed the cheese topping with my homemade wholewheat bread heels made into crumbs.  I thought that at least I'd be able to break up the clots in the heart and colon a bit.  The addition of the breadcrumbs added a nice, crisp crust.  The recipe doubles easily, and travels well.  It's not yo' mamas mac & cheese.  The only recipe that let me down a bit was the pineapple upside down cake that didn't direct me what to do with the brown sugar caramel after making it. Ah well",1
"This book is clearly not written for the patient, but for the scientist. Especially the skeptic.  It is an intriguing compilation, with scientific evidences, of numerous paths for future study.

"Ben Cheever delights in toying around in the real world.  I wish he would have had his little adventure then written a novel about it.  It would make good light reading; a shallow tale of an immature spoiled rich kid in middle age that flirts with the dangerous real world and how he comes back none-the-wiser.  By his admission it is an ersatz adventure.  He feigns risk, hoping to enlighten us.  Yet Cheever thinks he can ride the roller coaster and describe what its like to climb Mt. Everest.  Why else would he publish it as non-fiction?    If you have the desire to learn how difficult it is to live as a low-wage employee read Barbera Ehrenrich's ""Nicked and Dimed.",1

"Newport Jazz Festival, 1956, a bunch of rich white folks, being in style go to a jazz festival. They obviously were very timid and unaware of Duke Ellington and his men, and they give some soft golf claps in the beginning while the announcer is announcing Duke and his men. The band then goes on to perform, a very dark and chilling version of ""Black and Tan Fantasy"" with Cat Anderson, Quinten Jackson, and Russel Procope giving great performances. Next follows a passive but nice version of ""Tea for Two"" played by Willie Cook in a Clifford Brown tone. Then the band goes on break for quite some time due the fact that key members are missing and have not showed up yet. Then we go on to Billy Stayhorn's ""Take The A Train"", then the first main course, ""The Newport Jazz Festival Suite"". This was not completly finished by Ellington/Strayhorn as it was played this night. And it is played with passion, even if it is not perfect. Some great soloist strutt thier stuff- Jimmy Hamilton, Clark Terry, Ray Nance, ect. Then the great baritone player, Harry Carney (who was with duke since the 20's) plays an decent rendition (He usually played this better) of ""Sophistcated Lady"", then a terrible vocal take by Josh Grisham on ""Day In, Day Out"". Next in the second main course, ""Dimuendo and Crescendo in Blue"", every that needs to be said about this has already been said. Then this crowd, this stiff and boring crowd get going. Screaming for more, Duke gives them his all time great soloist, Johnny Hodges. He plays beautifully on ""I Got It Bad"" and ""Jeep's Blues"". The crowd is still getting more and more crazy, and after ""Tulip and Turnip"", Sam Woodyard solos on ""Skip Deep"" and bring them to the edge again. They end with a few bars of ""Mood Indigo"" with the crowd screaming for more. I understand that a near-riot seems like nothing in Rock - n Roll terms today. But these people aren't drunk and pointlessly unruly like rock fans (I been to concert were people are moshing and a band is still setting up, which proves that this Rock-n-Roll energy ain't nothing), these people were takin away by this music. As much as they wanted to be boring and hardly cheer, they couldn't help and had to scream. For one night, improvised music was appreciate",0
"What a great collection! I was unsure whether to purchase this CD as I typically find that I only like a few songs on CD collections.  This one is really different.  There are songs that everyone will know, as well as  songs you may have heard a couple of times in clubs, but didn't really know  who they were by.  The recording quality is also very good.  This  collection would be a pleasure to listen to for anyone really, but old  goths will really be transported to an earlier time and place.  Ahh! The  memories! How things have changed.  All in all, I have to say a highly  recommended purchase, besides you get two CDs for the price. What a deal",0
"What a little treasure this is! TONS of great tips and tricks.  The B&W pages and lack of DVD-ROM keep the price right!  Easy to pick up and absorb when you have a few spare minutes (great for bathroom reading), and keep it handy by your workstation for a bit of reading during renders.  Some of the tips I knew, but had forgotten and fell out of using, others were new to me!  Great value",1
"The blackout story continues in the second book in the Restoration series. The town is beginning to adapt to an lifestyle without electricity. It is like living in the middle ages again, with the people having to discover new ways to survive. The Banning family has managed to create a semi-comfortable life in this new world. They have food, will soon have water, shelter, and most importantly each other. However not everyone has it this lucky, as the reader is introduced to a group of siblings trying to fend for themselves without their mother. The two groups clash with a battle about what it takes to truly survive in this new world.Reading about the filth that the children had to live in made me really uncomfortable at times. It's really amazing how we take just a working toilet for granted. This book pretty much explains survival of the fittest. Only the people who lived in communities where there was some sense of order was able to live a semi-normal life while others were forced in extreme poverty and disarray. At times I sided with the children because they were just trying to survive, but then I'd side with the Bannings because they had worked hard for their food and didn't deserve for it to get stolen. It was really scary reading about how people will take advantage of others in desperate times, even children just to get food or other supplies. Aaron, even though sometimes his actions were wrong, had the right intentions for his siblings, putting his family first before everything. I felt that was such a parallel to Deni in the first book, she put everything but her family as her primary focus. The only thing I found irksome is that everyone forgives each other really quickly even for doing terrible things to them. I just felt it a little unreal in such a time like that. Other than that, this was another thrilling read, another deep thinker of a book. Looking forward to when the next book comes out",1
"William Ashbrook's ""The Operas of Puccini"" is an accurate, gracefully written, and thoroughly interesting account of its subject.  For each opera, Ashbrook methodically examines literary sources, discusses relevant biographical evidence, and analyzes musical ""fingerprints"" of Puccini's style.  Ashbrook clearly loves his subject (which cannot be said for Charles Osborne, whose similar but extremely sour account cannot hold a candle to Ashbrook's).  I frequently return to Ashbrook's text to check some detail or merely to reacquaint myself with an opera I haven't seen recently, and I always come away from the book with renewed respect for its author and subject.  In the tradition of Ashbrook's magisterial account of the life of Donizetti, ""The Operas of Puccini"" is a cornerstone text for opera fans",1
"I just read this book recently after a long and torturous 40 year search for the ""truth."" It is like I have dogged Dennis' every step to finally arrive, in my understanding, at what he so simply expresses in this charming book. His list of references looks like the line up in my bookcase. As I read the book I witnessed myself sighing a series of quiet ""yeap, yeap,..., yeaps."" I was neither elated nor frightened by what I read, rather I was overtaken with an attitude of resigned recognition of the undeniable and blindingly obvious - like it or not, how else could it possibly be? I wondered what I would have felt if this were to have been the first book that I had read on this subject. I can't say for sure but my guess would probably have been either total dismissal or recoiling fear - in both cases my ego would have been running for its life. I think this because about 20 years ago I had both reactions when I first started to understand the real implications of realisation or enlightenment - no ego, no future, no past - no me! So what can I say to you about it? I don't really know, but if this is the first or the last book that you read on your search, what I can say is that you will, sooner or later, if you are serious, be forced to sigh in total resignation. As you go around and around the block you will have no choice but to finally admit that you will have to leave the block to parts unknown to ever have a hope of satisfying your insatiable thirst, and it will be the very last thing that you would have expected or hoped for but there it is - neatly and clearly summarised in Dennis' book. Do yourself a favour and just read it all the way through even if you then drop it and turn away from it for the next twenty years, you will be back one day and you will be glad. And then you will need and want to read, ""I AM THAT"" by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj",1
"I highly recommend this lovely book. The basic plot centers around the Elliot family who purchase a Medieval inn in the English countryside. Themes include continuity (of family)and healing from past mistakes and  poor decisions. Goudge is a very descriptive writer. She takes you to the  houses Dameroshay and the Herb of Grace, and into the enchanted forest  where the fairy person lives, caring for the needy animals. Characters are  true to life set in the post WWII period. I also recommend this for using  in High School English lit courses (which I teach) for examples of not only  descriptive writing, but also for allusion, character development, and good  use of plot. Even though it is out of print, this is a lovely book that  deserves numerous readings and will provide hours of enjoyment",1
"Several other reviews go into great and insightful detail, so I won't be redundant.  Suffice it to say that as a young man I wore out a cassette of this album with my Panasonic ""portable"" player and its single bud headphone!  I knew nothing about music then, but was mesmerized by the cleverness and imagination in these songs.  Now, as an older music junkie, I'd really forgotten about this until a chance hearing of ""Poor Boy"" in an old record store.  What a joy to hear it all again in this re-mastering! Sure, the nostalgia was a big part of it, but now I can really see the genius in the composition, usually using just a couple of instruments (varied from song to song) to create the heart of the tune.  Yes, use headphones (I recommend the TWO bud variety) to get the full richness and clever additions to each song.  I like almost all of Supertramp's albums, but for me this is the one that moves more out of the pop/prog zone and into an area that's really unique.  It's one of the few in my collection that I can't play too much",0
"This book conveys so many wonderful thoughts and ideas.  First, it teaches a deep reverance for the natural world.  Its approach to prayer speaks to a deep spirituality that recognizes the sacredness and interconnectedness of all living things.  It portrays a wonderful intergenerational relationship between grandfather and grandchild.  And it captures the beauty of nature and the personal renewal that can occur from a walk in the woods.  This is a superb book for children of all ages -- even those 80+ years old",1
"First, to diffuse some of the objections to this book you might come across:1. ""Overuse of the Vampire analogies and other metaphors and imagery.""  Whoever found them distracting was just not understanding them.  Bernstein uses each one to make a very specific point, and with their aid he makes that point compeletely clear and accessible.  He does use the vampire analogy, but at almost every turn there's a new take on it.  His writing is very colorful and just as intentional.Also, Bernstein is uproariously funny (but never funny just for the sake of being funny).  And a lot of that is in his use of metaphors, etc.  Before I got 1/2 way through, I checked the 'about the author' to see if he'd done stand-up comedy on the side.  Apparently he does a lot of public speaking.  A good comedian points out things you haven't really thought about and then makes them entertaining.  And when you laugh at something it usually means that you can relate to it and that you completely understand the message.  The clarity and liveliness needed to be an effective public speaker, along with the didactic humor, keep things humming from cover to cover.  If you're not at least giving a chuckle every few pages or so, either you're not getting it, or there's a much more serious concern...2.  ""Not enough concrete advice.""  Whoever could think this, they are truly not seeing the forest for the trees!  This book is loaded with practical advice and revolves around delivering that advice in the most effective way. I identified my vampire, and I'm going to take a totally different approach to them based on the practical information I found here.  In fact Bernstein says outright that while finding the root cause of a disorder can be interesting, it can often be a distraction from how to deal with the practical issues you have face.  And, true to his word, everything he says either frames his practical advice, tees it up or delivers it--usually with illustrations on how one might apply it.3.  ""There are better books out there on the subject.""  It's hard to imagine.  Maybe there are.  But it's all moot anyway when the critic doesn't actually provide any alternative titles or make any effort to back the statement up.While you're reading and enjoying, you're picking up some rather subtle points all along the way, maybe without even quite realizing how difficult it would really be to take up these otherwise abstract and difficult points and then render them as accessible as Bernstein does.  This book is full of valuable tools, and concepts that are crucial to understanding and dealing with this type of person.  I know, based on personal experience--frighteningly personal experience.  My vampire is a paranoid obsessive-compulsive.  Bernstein illustrates a typical conversation that an OC vampire might have, and I've had that EXACT SAME conversation, in almost identical circumstances and which included a lot of the same exact words and phrases!  Bernstein accomplishes everything, and more, that one would want to see in a practical introduction to the more common personality disorders--only EXTREMELY WELL!  After reading this book you'll feel a lot less alone in your situation and a lot more equipped to deal with your vampires.  ",1
"This movie did not have too many spoken lines, it's main focus is on showing the viewer how the two people are bonding, becoming one, by their actions.  You must have a tough stomache to endure the extreme gruesome scene in the movie.  I couldn't eat for a few days after watching this movie.  Most of all, it plays with your mind on a psychological level, so be extremely mentally strong in order to watch this.  For those who are hard core horror fans, like myself, just thought that you should know that this movie is not a horror.  It's about a human being's desires and executing those desires in real life.

"I have just completed this book after purchasing it about 1 1/2 years ago. I made a choice after recieving the title, to read the book little by little before I go to bed at night to ""serialize"" the drama of Adolf Hitler's rise to power, his rule, and his ultimate downfall. I found that this book was very much suited for this type of reading. I have read 2 other Hitler biographies, both of which were many times shorter then this one and after compraison, suspiciously biased. The one biography was George Victor's ""Hitler : The Pathology of Evil."" Unlike that book, Toland does not have a grand theory[ies] on what made Hitler tick, and whats more, Toland does not forward any perposterous theories (such as one that stated Hitler had ""smaller"" or ""deformed"" sex organs, a claim that is refuted with evidence by Toland. Or the completely bizzare account claimed by some, that Adolf Hitler forced Eva Braun to defecate on him durring some intimate moment) that are obvioully stated to dehuminize or embarass the ""historical man."" Toland does however hint at certain possiblities or explanation of action, buy, in the most part, it is obvious that Toland very much wants his reader to make their own opinion on the events and the man. The works cited and notes in the end of the book are simply amazing. Although I have not read too many biographies of this length, I must say that the extensive notes and works that are refrenced is simply staggering (I have not as of yet been able to validify any of the works cited, but I have no doubt they are accuruate). This book would make a great introduction to World War 2 in the viewpoint of hte German political high command. The modus operandai is drawn out concisely and thoroughly in the 890+ pages of text. One will be completely amazed on both fronts. First how dynamic and amazing a political leader Adolf Hitler really was, yet, one will also be amazed at the stupidity and reckless gambling Adolf Hitler often resorted too in his dealings with international leaders. Toland corroborates Victor's observation of Hitler's obsession with ""fate"" or ""providence"" to carry him forward from one crisis to another. Indeed, according to Toland, the collosal blunder of overplaying his hand and taking Poland was a complete gamble that Hitler chalked to ""providence"" to bring him to safety. Whereas Victor's biography offers a ""Freudian"" analysis of this decision-behavior, perhaps, stating it was a residule of infantile behavior from Hitler's obsession with his mother (or some other psycho-babble like this), Toland makes no such reach and merely states the facts as far as he can determine them. This book pays Hitler his dues when deserved, and shows his many flaws when they are apparent. It shows that one does not need to be blatently biased to demonstrate that Adolf Hitler was far from a super-man. I cannot account for others who have read this book, but I came away from the biography feeling that Adolf Hitler was somewhat naive in his command of the military. Guiled by his luck in the beginning of the war, he quickly bought into the propoganda that he was somehow a military genius and this led to complete disaster. To abruptly conclude this review, technically, the book is worthwhile, if only for the extensive sources in the back of the book. Any 'arm-chair' historian of World War 2 should have this book, it would serve as a great opener to World War 2 or as a complete seperate book for those who are just curious about the Man/Monster/Myth of Adolf Hitler.

"This is one of my favorite books.  I love the story and was excited to finally own my own copy.  This edition is really great because it is lightly annotated.  There are one or two footnotes on just about every page, defining french terms or just uncommon words.  This makes reading that much more enjoyable because one understands more.  If you enjoy the book, there is a musical with an amazing soundtrack by the same name",1

"This is a fun book! I ordered this from Amazon about a year ago because I couldn't find it in any of the bookstores. My teenage daughter took mine and is enjoying what's left of it. There are SO many fun excercises in this book that you can do to be creative. I tore out a few of the postcards from the back with the quotes on them and put them up around the house. I enjoy the dice, they're fun. I love the colorful illustrations, and the color all through the book. There's a ""Living Out Loud"" Board game that you can tear out and use. One of my favorite things is the ""Wish Jar"" -and I have made my own...it was a very uplifting way to spend an afternoon! I felt great afterwards! I tore out the ""permission cards"" and I use them regularly! This book just makes me feel like a kid again!

"I read this book almost ten years ago when I was in the seventh grade.  I found it and read it myself, no teacher help.  I have to say this in defense of this book--it made a profound impact on me when I was 12 years  old.  It was the first time I realized that the Holocaust wasn't just about  Jews.  In retrospect, I think it was the first time I realized the ENTIRE  horror of what really happened.  These many years later, of course, this  book doesn't mean the same thing.  But it is a very powerful work for  younger readers and it helps paint a complete picture of what Nazi Germany  was like.  I highly recommend it to show just how insane things were",1

&quot;Towards A Poor Theatre&quot; by Jerzy Grotowski is probably the most important book written on acting since Stainslavsky's three famous character books. There is so little known about Grotowski and many people have tried to fake his work and people need to read the man's original words. Grotowski's vision of theatre has had the greatest effect on me more than any other person in theatre. He saw acting as a Holy experience where both the actor and spectator were transformed after the performance. Grotowski expanded from where Stainslavsky left off and drew his ideas everywhere from modern art to religious rituals to primitive theatre. Any one interested in theatre must read this book somehow and be changed forever like I have,1
"I was fortunate enough to take an Art class in college that used the Seventh Edition of this text for the class. I still refer to it after about 10 years or so, and it's the only text for an ""elective"" that I still have after all of this time.I use this text quite a bit in my photography work, since all of the elements (line, shape, value, etc) are as applicable to photography as it is to painting and other expressive forms.I either own or have read through most other books on photographic composition, and none are as good as this book - consider it ""classical training"" if you want your work to move out of the ""snapshooter"" phase",1

"I've listened to people rave about this book for years, and being a horror junkie, I couldn't help but pick up a copy as soon as Leisure re-released it.  I tore the cover open, expecting to be blown away.  Did I read the same book that's getting all of the 5 star reviews and adoring cover-blurbs?  I feel horribly cheated.For starters, the story was propelled by the shallowest plot I've read in horror fiction.  Who are these cannibals, why are they there, what is their purpose, and what has brought them to such a point of unintelligent animalism?  I hope you aren't looking for answers to these questions within the book.  Nevermind the fact that there were no psychological elements behind the killings whatsoever.  This short, bland novel is the literary equivalent of a slasher b-movie.The characters here were 2-dimensional. Basically fodder to be sequentially killed off.  But that wasn't the worst narrative element.  The writing itself was amatuer, sloppy, and just plain laughable.  Instead of attempting to depict characters in a unique light, the author chooses to isntead bombard us with so many pronouns that we lost track of which ""he"", ""she"", or ""child"" he's even referring to at most times.Then we come to the gore.  People keep referring to this book as the most extreme horror on the market.  Call me psychotic if you will, but I didn't cringe once.  If you want graphic depictions of extreme violence, complete with fully developed characters, psychological intruigue, suspense, and plot development, let me suggest Michael Slade's ""Headhunter"" or J.F.

I have never seen a more carefully explained introduction into an area of mathematics.  Many examples and explanations of the principles behind and applications of  concept analysis. However, the glaring fault is organization. Details are  given without adequate tie in to how they relate to others. The text  bounces from one area to the next so it is easy to lose sight of the whole  picture. On balance its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses so I  recommend it without reservation",1
"This is a no nonsense workout that will make you stream with sweat while working every part of the body.  The workout incorporates cardio with strength training for maximum calorie expenditure and fat burning.  Even the most fit will be challenged by this workout, since the intensity level can be raised with the simple addition of heavier dumbbells.  If you want a straightforward workout that will make you sweat and feel like you have thoroughly conditioned your entire body, this workout is the one to get",0
"This toaster oven's timer is faulty - we were making toast, next thing we knew there was smoke bellowing out from it and the toast itself was on fire!!!  With today's technology Oster should take more care in providing a toaster oven with an accurate timer.  This oven almost started a house fire.  I would not recommend this oven to anyone",0
I bought this book based on a couple of reviews I read.  The subject matter was intriguing so I ordered it thinking it was going to be a light summer read.  What I was not expecting was what a fantastic writer the author is.  The book was great!  Entertaining and fun!  I was actually sad when I got to the end.  It is one of the few books I will re-read eventually (when I get finished with my stack of recently ordered books by my bed). Enjoy it,1

"I would be very hard-pressed to say that Leatherbarrow's book on Dostoevsky would appeal that anyone other than someone interested in Dostoevsky, but for the average above-average-intelligence person who thinks Dostoevsky is God, this is a great book.  I would definitely not read this until you have read several of Dostoevsky's major books, so that you are familiar with what the authors are talking about.  I, personally, had just read Crime and Punishment, the Brothers Karamazov, and Notes from Underground, and was getting psyched to read the Idiot when I sought out and found Leatherbarrow's book--perfect timing.The book is a collection of 11 essays, each by a different author and on a different perspective on Dostoevsky.  Topics include D and religion, Russian folk heritage, D as a professional writer, D and the intelligentsia, psychology, 1840's Russian literature, D and money, family, and science, as well as a great introduction by Leatherbarrow.  And as Leatherbarrow mentions in his introduction, the book is aimed at the non-academic reader, though by all means the essays are very rigorous and insightful.  D clearly had a lot on his mind when he wrote, many details of which 21 st century, non-Russian readers are not fully aware of.  The background information on the swirling political climate surrounding D and his involvement in it was very interesting.  I got a lot out of this book and would highly recommend it.  I had looked through several other criticism books before reading this one--they all seemed dry and boring.  This book was just what I was looking for.  And did I mention that all the essays are only 15-20 pages long?     ",1

"The author presents several different ""methods"" for sharpening a knife. They all boil down to ""scrub the knife back and forth on a stone"". This will produce an edge of sorts but not a very good one. He dismisses the collected wisdom of millennia of knife sharpening as ""bull"" without any evidence to support his claim. The author says he has ""studied"" and tested his methods. This mean he tries shaving with each blade until it feels right. The rest of the book is an ad for his products. Don't waste you money.If you are interested in the actual science of sharpening with detailed instructions on how to sharpen almost anything then Leonard Lee's The Complete Guide to Sharpening is the book to read.If you just want to sharpen you kitchen knives, send them out to a sharpening service every couple of years.(Ask at the local Chef supply store) They will use a slack belt or hollow edge sharpener to put a perfect edge on.

"Very disappointing, especially after the rave reviews on the back cover. The book is little more than a vehicle for Ballard's much aired views on suburban alienation. These views are done to death in this book. The dialogue is absurd, the plot is risible, the characters cardboard and the prose style is tired. I don't recommend it",1
"When I first learned of this book I have to say I was a bit skeptical of it having any sort of effect on my eating habits, but after having read the information I can honestly say my whole life has changed.  This book starts from the BEGINNING of  meat industry prodction and takes you through a journey from chemically laced animal feed, to its effect on individual health, and finally to the eminent dangers planet earth faces if present day agriculture is not immediatley altered.  I have officially refrained from all meat and dairy sources after being educated with the facts, which is quiet a large acomplishment for a single book.  I recomend this book to anyone seeking the truth on food production in America. Once armed with the facts you will find yourself empowered to gain control of your health through food choices, which in turn can create a happier life.  (The first couple chapters may seem a bit overly sensitive and redundant, but keep forging ahead...I promise the juicy stuff will soon begin to rear its ugly head)",1
My son asked me to read a short story by Alice Walker. He was analyzing different writing styles for a writing class. I was pleasantly taken back by the way she uses certain details  to communicated to those of us who are not literature major's. I bought several of her books. In reading  them I found that she had retained a sense of her Africa culture. Her outlook is hoslitic and circular while  most white writers  write  linear.  The purpose  of writing is to communicate and Alice Walker does that. Her writing is not pretentious but humble like the people she writes about. Her writing  metaphorically legitimizes being black,1

"This tricycle is simply way too big.  While the seat position is adjustable, even when adjusted, this thing is simply huge!  I imagine my 2 year old will have to double in leg length to be able to ride this monster.  By then, he'll be 5 or 6 and be plenty big enough for a normal size bike, so I just don't get the point of this.  Why in the world would someone build a trike so big?I did like that the trike had large pneumatic tires, and was fairly sturdy (at least in terms of construction).  I suppose if you have a really large child that wants a trike instead of a bike, maybe this monster would be OK. I did have a few issues with design and/or build quality though: First, the grips are fairly fragile plastic and I imagine will break after just a tumble or two.  Second, the way the seat ""adjustment"" works is simply by sliding the seat clamp up and down the main support bar.  This would be OK, but the seat clamp was too big for the support bar, so I had to shim it with something to get it to stay in place.    Overall, I'm just not very impressed.    ",0
"I got this just to add to my strength training workout. I was a little skeptical at first, but my trainer added it to my program so I had to buy one.

I would definately recommend this",0

"as a cook at a well known nyc restaurant, i spend a minimum of 3 hours a day with a knife in my hand. over the years, i have used many brands and types of knives.  I've owned german--wustof, messemiester and japanese--global and mac, but i find myself constanly reaching for this knife. it feels really comfortable in my hand.  it's well balanced in is great for everything.  if i could only own one knife, this would be it.  I would also like to note that anyone with hand or wrist problems including arthritis should give this knife a try.  i've had tendonitis from cooking and the ergonomic design of the hand has been a tremendous relief.  at first it may feel a bit awkward, but it soon feels comfortable.  i'm just a little embarrased now that it has the rachel ray print on the blade.  that's not something you want seen in a professional kitchen",0
"This is the live album to outdo all other live albums. I am a head banging, rock and roller, guitar nut and this is still the best live album ever!The main reason that it is great is b/c Sam Cooke works the audience. The cd builds up steam as the songs go by. This is a snowball rolling down a hill that gets bigger and bigger.He talks to the audience, works the ladies, entices the men, pumps up his band, etc. The songs are almost a ""best of"" situation. Chain gang, having a party, twisting are all awesome!You know how great the cd is? The recording has serious limitations. There are no highs and no lows. Horns, guitar, bass, drums are all mixed way towards the back but Cooke's singing and talking are way towards the front. It does not matter and should not influence anyone's listening pleasure.A great comparison is to Otis Redding live at the Whiskey a Go Go. That is a good concert, fantastic sound recording and the band seriously rocks. This blows that away.This is not only the best concert cd but also, it is obvious how other entertainers and djs modeled themselves afer Sam Cooke's style.What a shame that this tremendous performer died in his prime.Whoever reads this take note...I am no soul music fanatic. I am a Lez Zep. Who, Nirvana, guitarnut type of guy. THAT is how powerful that this work is b/c it most definetly rocks more than ""live at leeds"", ""get your ya yas out"", ""Song remains the same"", etc.     ",0

"this is your film!This is an absolutely incredible journey into the lives of an aristocratic Swedish family.   The scene is brilliantly framed by the coming death of the eldest of three sisters, who has stayed on the family estate while the other two were married.  Each carries her own pathology, which are portrayed in the memories of single instances, one in an affairand the other by the brutal denial of sex by self mutilation.   They are engraved in the memory of the viewer as they were into me when I saw this over 30 years ago.  (Amazingly, I did not feel that the film had aged in any way whatsoever, but was just as fresh and intense as the day I saw with an early sweetheart.) While I disagree with certain reviewers here, who contend that the sisters exemplify the human condition - I saw them as creatures sick in their own ways - the basic fears that their situation evokes are archetypal:  living with pain, forbidden desires, and the mysteries of existence and death.  It is part of Bergman's genius that he succeeds in getting us to imagine these things so totally in the space of 2 hours.  Warmly recommended. Just make sure you are rady for a rough ride",0

"There have been very few poets with such creative mind, potency and inexhaustibleness as R.M.R. He was a cosmic poet of introspective flight loaded if you want of musical intimacy, his thoughts seem to be Chopin's Nocturnes and he sings his rapture homage to the night as a few indeed but the most impressive character is behind that radiant language's use there is a shaman speaking by him. You may not argue the lack of time concerning to Rilke: the poetry simply doesn't understand about absences and coordinates of space or time, simply it appears and seduces you with the exemplary serenity of an astonished child. O course his nocturnal visions were expanded by Nietzsche and Lou Andreas Salomé.This fundamental text will lead you to another spheres where the Fourth Wall, in what dreams and love walk freely without rules, engagement in the most absolute disobey 's spirit , the essential premise of the artists, children and heroes.

"Not sure if you like Slowdive? This collection of songs, unlike most compilations does a wonderful job of showing you who this band is. In other words, If you don't like this collection you probably do not like Slowdive. This is Slowdive at there best, While it does lack a few great songs, overall it is pretty amazing. If you do like this set a lot, as a huge Slowdive fan I recommend hunting down all the CD's and EP's you can find. It may be difficult but if you like this material you will love just about everything you hear by Slowdive. In all my searches I have not found another band that even comes close to being as amazing as Slowdive. Most fans of Shoegaze music will tell you My Bloody Valentine is the best of the genre, while they are the originators of this style, Slowdive has perfected what they started. I am a big MBV fan but they just do not touch Slowdive. I highly recommend this album for new listeners of Slowdive, and also long time fans, as there is a lot of hard to find material on this album, and a live peel sessions version of Golden hair that will give you the chills. This music is so good it, it almost doesn't seem human. If your looking for more material by slowdive I would highly recommend these other albums:1. Souvlaki (My Favorite)2. Pygmalion (Out of print, but worth trying to hunt down. Try Ebay)3. Just for a Day (not represent that well on this compilation)4. Blueday (Also out of print, but this collection has most the songs)While Slowdive sadly no longer exists, most of the members have some great side projects, but none are quite as amazing as Slowdive. Check out The Monster Movie, Neil Halstead, Mojave 3, Rachel Goswell. Get this CD and get into the greatest, underated band ever!(P.S. Souvlaki Space Station is the best Song you'll ever hear!",0

"Korea was a tragedy.  What makes it such a great tragedy is that so many  men died and suffered due to the incompetence and egos of men like Douglas  McArthur who was rarely if ever under fire or understood the big picture  what he was throwing men into. Yet it was a real success of sorts as the  Koreans did want us --unlike Vietnam -- and we did succeed in keeping half  of Korea as a free democratic (such as it is) country.  Unlike Vietnam, we  bothered to listen to those we were there to help and our objectives were  highly compatible, definable and achievable.  Precisely because they wanted  to be free and not because of force of arms they were free.  The will to be  free was the real weapon, the force of arms was the means or one means to  get there.  This book gives a highly factual accurate riveting account of  what was at stake in the world, for Korea, for us, for Japan, etc. and  shows how important the actions of individuals - omissions (e.g.,  McArthur's weak G-2) and commissions (Matt Ridgway's real leadership of the  men after McArthur's dismissal) can be to the outcome in history.  The  landing at Inchon was probably the luckiest landing in history and it made  McArthur look good, but it was not the key to what eventually happened.   Read on.  You will be amazed how poor our intelligence was, how poorly  equipped in the way of weaponry and clothing our men were.  How nieve many  of our commanders and McArthur was about the greatly limited ability to use  tanks and heavy artillary (Korea is a rugged tough, mountainess country,  not the rolling hills of WWII European mainland. Korea was perfect for  ambushing and massacring larger forces. If you want the inspiring and heart  wrenching truth of Korea told in a highly readable book, then this one is  for you and all lovers of those who attempt to write accurate history  (i.e., complete, factual renderings of the key parties, feelings, actions,  and philosophies involved)",1

Compact synopses of the Torah portions, suggestions for all kinds of mitzvot you can do, and even a section helping the non-Jewish family members feel welcome and up the learning curve.

"Can anyone who concludes a scholarly work about Nietzsche by dismissing him as a ""miserable little man"" really be trusted to give a balanced assessment of the great philosopher? No, Alexander Nehamas can't.To him, Nietzsche was ""[c]ruel and heartless, neither protective nor respectful of the sensibilities of others."" The pathetic curmudgeon was ""[d]isdainful and contemptuous of the values and lives of most people....[and] has offended and hurt many and will doubtless continue to do so in the future."" (Speaking of contempt, in a 1998 interview Nehamas struck another low blow against Nietzsche by deriding him as a ""philosopher of adolescence."") In the last, schoolmarmish pages of this book, he continues to chide Nietzsche for his ""cruelty, his attacks on many of our ideas and values, on our habits and sensibilities.""To whom is Nehamas referring when he pompously invokes this royal ""our""? Did Nietzsche really hold all of his readers' ideas, values, habits, and sensibilities in contempt...or just those of certain readers like Nehamas and other sissified academic leftists of his ilk, whom he despised in his own day as careerists or worse? Poor Prof. Nehamas. He apparently expects Nietzsche to have maintained a tone of measured politesse while single-handedly changing the course of moral philosophy and profoundly affecting the aesthetic milieu of the 20th century and beyond. I guess it wasn't easy for Nietzsche to remain sensitive to everyone's feelings when he was philosophizing with a hammer. Nietzsche would no doubt be gratified that such whining--clear evidence of slave morality--comes from no less an eminence than the Edmund N. Carpenter II Class of 1943 Professor in the Humanities at Princeton. This in itself proves Nietzsche's prescience. He would point out that, for him, launching ""attacks"" on herd animals like Prof. Nehamas was both a cardinal pursuit and an exquisite pleasure.  More than a century after his death, Nietzsche still has the power to upset the more weak-stomached of the scholarly horde. Unless you're a Nietzsche-hater, avoid this unsympathetic, condescending tome!",1

"The Color Purple by Alice Walker is a thrilling novel about two sister's struggles for social equality, both racial and sexist. They are separated at a young age and spend years trying to find each other once more. Filled with brutal abuse, romance and ridiculous public beliefs The Color Purple covers many issues that most black women had to deal with living in the early 1900's southern states. 	Cellie is the main character in this novel and the first page is solely a vivid description about her rape and the culprit; her father. It progresses as she is married off to the man who actually loved her sister and who later sends her sister away because she refuses to love him. Shug Avery, her husband's mistress, arrives years later ill and her spirit broken. Cellie nurses her back to health and back to her life as a famous singer. Throughout this time Cellie undergoes the abuse her husband subjects her to, the trivial feelings she has growing for Shug and also the loss of her sister and the two children she had as an outcome of her father's rapes. Her friend, Sofia is thrown in jail for disrespecting a white man and she is left alone, that is until Shug says, ""I love you, Miss Cellie"" (113). The remainder of the novel focuses on their trivial love triangle and the two sister's journey back into each other's arms. 	The journey all of the characters take in this book are vivid descriptions of the lifestyle many people lived in the early 1900's. Walker portrays life as it was back then and does not leave any miniscule detail out. She describes a woman's needs to be loved, the pain of a husband's abuse and a father's rape, the difficulty of being a black woman in the time era and also the difficulty of losing ones family. Cellie would always say, ""My mama die, my sister Nettie run away. Mr. ______ come git me to take care of his rotten children. He never ast me nothing bout myself. Nobody every love me"" (112). It is amazing that a woman living today is able to imagine such a life and that she is able to clearly portray it in a piece of writing.	Even more amazing, Walker uses diction from the time era which helps a reader distinguish between these types of situations today and how much worse they were back then because women, especially black women, had no freedoms or rights. An example of the type of diction and how women were expected to act is, ""Sofia so surprise to hear me speak up she ain't chewed for ten minutes"" (200). Also, it is easy to understand the oppression women faced when one reads lines like, ""After all that, I don't spect you had a chance to see if you could make Sofia mind"" (36). Even though it may be difficult for many American's to relate to these characters, women in other countries with less rights may be able to understand the power struggle this woman underwent. Walker's use of illiterate diction is a great way to help a reader understand how these people lived and especially some of the reason's this woman underwent such agony. 	Over all, The Color Purple by Alice Walker is a thrilling novel about racial and sexist discrimination, rape, romance and ridiculous public beliefs that impacted Cellie in more ways than one. In my opinion, it is perhaps the best literal perception taken on life back then and I recommend any person interested in a exhilarating story line or dramatic social issues, should read this book. You will not be disappointed!",1
"It is always so satisfying to discover a book that treats its subject in a way to make it interesting to any and all readers: Simon Winchester's book The Professor and the Madman about the birth of the Oxford English Dictionary; Dava Sobel's book on Longitude;  Andrew Solomon's The Noonday Demon on depression - the list is long and always growing. Happily, Leila Hadley's book, A Garden by the Sea, easily secures a place on my short list of nonfiction books that stretch well beyond their topics, captivating the general reader and gardener alike.I have two black thumbs, yet continue to use them to turn the pages of A Garden by the Sea, marveling at Ms. Hadley's descriptions of her beloved garden, her unusual life and travels, and the changing seasons as viewed from the shores of the Northeastern seacoast. There is plenty of practical knowledge about how to cultivate an organic seaside garden: climate maps, Latin names of plants, planting depths, garden pests, seasonal considerations, etc., but it is her ruminations away from the hardcore information that make me want to take trowel and hoe in hand.  My favorite chapter is about her Dream Garden, which encompasses a white garden and a moonlit garden: ""The attraction of a white garden is that it gleams in the evening. . . lovely by day, pale-petaled scented flowers become magical by starlight, especially with a birdbath to reflect moonbeams, and the light of pierced brass Moroccan lanterns. "" I have become inspired to green my thumbs and find a patch of soil, even if it's just off my Manhattan apartment's fire escape, and grow my ""jungle of blue morning glories in terracotta pots on a New York trelllised balcony . . . no larger than a bath mat.""

"This is one of the best albums ever!  It doesnt matter who sang it, wrote it, etc. - the shame of all of it is that two absolutely drop dead gorgeous guys were cornered into doing this with lip synching alone.  Who did sing it?  The music is fantastic.  It also represents a great era - the 80's - that will never be repeated or the same.  My best friend and I were lucky enough to party with these two beautiful creatures one night when they were in Dallas - and they were so kind, and humble - and stunning to look at.  Dont follow or listen to the negativity that happened to them - if you dont know the real story, look it up, and see what really happened.  Every artist at one time or another lip synchs.  I am not saying that I agree with them misrepresenting themselves as the singers of these songs at all - this was from their management company.  Just two beautiful guys, inside and out, caught in a very bad business/management decision-deal, with so much money thrown at them, how could they say no?  I will forever love their music!!!D/Dalla",0

"This album was originally released on the Warner Bros. Seven Arts label in 1968 in stereo only. The label had just begun its phaseout of mono. The original catalog number was WS 1745,at least in the United States. Don Rickles,who made a few television appearances prior to recording this album at Las Vegas's Sahara Hotel and Casino was,I guess we can say,competing with Bill Cosby,who also recorded for WB. We see on the cover,a tuxedo-clad Rickles,with mike in hand,of course. The back cover features a short written interview with Rickles. I remember Rickles guest-starring on a 1965 episode of CBS's The Beverly Hillbillies. This episode was one of the last black-and-white ones. Rickles' follow-up,DON RICKLES SPEAKS!,never was re-issued on CD. Rickles continued making television appearances after releasing this album. He still does today",0
"The difference between this book and the devotionals written today is like the difference between a prime rib steak and a bologny sandwhich. A lousy analogy, but point made. ""Daily Strength for Daily Needs"" is full of reflections that must be  read over and over in order to fully grasp the sentiment. Part of this is due to the excellent writing and terminology used from years ago, however it is not a difficult or frustrating book to read. There is a rich and reflective depth brought forth in a verse,a piece of poetry and then a reflection by a Christian from the 16th century to 18th century.This is the main devotional I have used for about 8 years now and it is full of underlined thoughts that have been compelling.Each year when I cycle back through it, I am always challenged afresh.I hope mine will last for 40 more years--it is rich beyond comparison",1
How many people have actually sat down and thought what the world would have missed if Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy hadn't paired up? I have been watching them for nearly 50 years now and this DVD with what I think are 5 of their best films is a real bargain at twice the price!It would be hard to leave any of these out of my top 10 films for them and The Music Box is a masterpiece of timeing. County Hospital where Stan has the novel idea of taking Ollie nuts to eat is brilliant and as usual Ollie ends up worse off than when he went into the hospital in the first place! A real must for any true fan.,0
To add to the review above about the 78 RPM Sound. To listen to Gardel with all the scratched and pops of the old recording is the full romantic essence of his music and of the era. A clean orchestrated Gardel as in True Lies is as plastic is to Gold,0
"This album is simple blues-rock dressed up in indie-rock robes with a few proggish flourishes lining the cuffs.  It definitely succeeds on that more basic level, and I fully recommend it.The Fiery Furnaces really hit the indie rock RADAR with their second album, ""Blueberry Boat"".  That album was a masterpiece, and I consider it the best of 2004.  Yet their debut album ""Gallowsbird's Bark"" stands on its own two legs and is not merely the embryonic form of their later work.Musically, it has much of the same raw garage-rock feel of the White Stripes, but with more complex instrumentation that allows for many layers of melodic lines to interweave across the background.  Acoustic rhythm guitar is embellished with electirc guitar riffs.  The piano is featured on many tracks, often accompanied by counter-melody on the synthesizer.Lyrically, the album is an extended travelogue.  If there's anything a band recording their debut LP would know about, it's travelling, and the band has clearly done alot of it in building its reputation as an excellent live band.  The song ""Crystal Clear"" (ironically used to describe the muddy Mississippi River) describes leaving Moline IL across the river into Iowa, probably on the I-74 bridge, and together with the other tracks on the album evokes a sense of having really moved about in that region.Even the album's politically-charged track ""We Got Back the Plague"" puts a populist midwestern cultural perspective at its heart, transforming what would otherwise be a cliched anti-Bush diatribe into something a little more clever.""Gallowsbird's Bark"" is far more accessible than their follow-up, but not quite as clever lyrically as the followup.  Musically, the album is so different from ""Blueberry Boat"" that it would be like comparing the proverbial ""apples and oranges"" to measure one against the other.  Still, the elements that would be combined into ""Blueberry Boat"" are all here in simpler form.Fans of the Fiery Furnaces via ""Blueberry Boat"" should definitely buy this album, unless their only appreciation for that album is in its electronica influences and proggish composition (which are lacking here.)  Indie rock fans should check this album out, especially if you enjoyed the White Stripes in their heyday",0
"I have been using this bag for the past 1.5 years, its still good and better than all the other laptop cases I have seen around used by my friends. In an actual event, my friend accidently dropped the bag with laptop inside, my Dell Inspiron 8600 was intact and was preserved by the bag. The small pouch is handy in keeping the electrical adapter. The bag can also be placed on the extendable handle of the carry bag if you travel a lot. Small pockets on the side help in storing pen for handy. and the bag also looks elegant. Overall this is a fabulous bag to buy and to save your laptop in accidental drops",0
"This is one of those books whose real storytelling power sneaks up on you.   It's a case study in Americana, in the guise of a travelogue.  Dudley and  Seaborg met a remarkable group of characters on their journey -- a cast few  novelists could dream up -- and they share their new friends with us in a  delightfully readable way.  The writing is so crisp and the imagery so  vivid that you can practically hear the crickets chirping as you read",1
"I have been interested in gemstone energy for several years, and this book is appropriate both for someone just beginning to learn about the subject, and for a person who is more familiar with how gemstone healing works. The photographs are gorgeous, and really provide you with a sense of the different types of gems.The information is presented in a clear, easy-to-understand format, and it is very well-written. If you are interested in working on a certain physical condition (or emotional/psychological issue), this book gives you advice on how to proceed, and which gemstones most benefit a particular problem. It also gives very detailed descriptions of the function of each gem.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in gemstones or other energy-healing subjects. It's perfect for dipping into a bit at a time, or for reading straight through. Educational and inspirational reading",1
"I bought this book for my two year son to introduce him to Halloween and the autumn season.  From the moment we received this book, it was one of his favorites.  The book goes step by step in planting, taking care of, and harvesting a pumpkin patch.  The pictures are so colorful and bright.  It is really an enjoyable book to read",1
"I can sum up my reaction to this DVD in one word - smile.  That's what I found myself doing throughout this wonderful performance.  Perhaps Carly's voice is not quite what it used to be, but that was never her attraction.  It is now, as it has always been, her uncanny ability to touch our hearts and give us all an intimate insight into the depth and breadth of her perception and emotion.  I loved the old standards from the Moonlight Serenade album, mixed with her own pop hits.  But I think my favorite part was the acoustic set where she sat down with just one guitar player, plus her own, and the backup singers, including her daughter, Sally Taylor.  Carly's duet with Sally on the old fifties song, ""Devoted To You"" was enough to bring tears to your eyes.  My only regret is that I was not there on the Queen Mary II, to witness this memorable event.  Thank goodness someone had the foresight to capture it for the rest of us.  ",0

"Not only should you not buy this book you shouldnt even open it.Karim Rashid deserves great credit for his ability to fool corporations and college freshmen into buying into his vision of a hot pink world but as far as design goes, he is a joke, his ""look"" was over in 1995 six months after it started. Anyone with a 3d modeling program on there home computer could produce this work. Take a shape, close your eyes, punch some keys on your computer, color it purple, call it a vase,lamp,chair,whatever and voila the Karim Rashid formula. The entire book almost is made not of photos but of computer generated images, this stuff doesnt even exist(thank God). He needs to go back to Canada or Egypt, repurchase the 40,000 records he supposidly ""threw in the trash"" and pick up his gig as the DJ he really is and leave the designing to the designers. Shame on the ignorant people out there who cant see the Emperor is naked",1
"While this DVD was obviously filmed in the early 1970s with the picture quality to match at times, the genius of David Bowie shines  through. As adults too young to remember or have seen Ziggy Stardust, it was an amazing look at the time period. The sound quality is suprisingly good, although some camera angles are distracting at times. It was also neat to hear Bowie's pronouncement of ""This is our last tour ever."" Little did he know... This DVD is worth every penny. Rock on",0
"Reading this book is uncanny because all the vague, hushed impressions that I have had over the years since I first came to consider myself a reader and thinker, are here laid out pretty articulately and well.  As a  high school student I saw the apathy around me and hated it, it depressed me horribly.  As a college student (now in my third year) I am finally finding that I am not alone in thinking that something is missing both from education and from the whole spiritual (if you will) surround of American life.  Bloom makes excellent points on just about every page.  A review complaining about Bloom's ""misreading"" of Nietzsche made me snicker.  The philosopher with a hammer is apparently infinitely hijackable.  Okay, so I am no Nietzsche expert, but from what I could tell, Bloom read the man thoughtfully, which is really all that one can do with such a slippery figure.I have to confess I have not finished the book but at page 100 I am sure it will give me a lot to think about, and not only does it provide good summary of Western social thought but also a way to think about these theories applying to reality, to today--arguing for the continued relevence of these dead thinkers.  I always believed this--I just needed someone to push this home, eloquently argue it.  Read this book!  Even if this review of mine is less than perfect, pick up the real book.  I think it's a great starting point to reading the thinkers themselves",1
"I read all the reviews of this product and almost didn't buy the game until I saw it on sale for 19.99 at Toys R Us and couldn't resist. I AM SO GLAD I DID. If you are a Star Wars fan (which I assume you are if you're looking at this game) this game is a must have. Sure some of the questions are easy but some of the questions are extremely difficult (but considering the fandom obsession with star wars even these questions may seem easy). To prove my point here is a sample question that I though was very hard ""Who is Darth Sidious talking about when he says 'I don't want to see this stunted slime in my site again'?"" Most people would initially think Nute Gunrray but it's actually the Nemodian standing next to him whose name I still don't recall. The only way anyone could possibly know this dudes name is if they studied the books. Next a lot has been staid about repeat questions. The game comes with 3 decks of cards and I played the game 3 times the first set and only had 1 or 2 repeat questions. As far as the DVDs go, they are set up for 20 games. That is to say you can play 20 games before you will get any repeat DVD questions. That's not as extensive as the Scene It games but that's still A LOT of questions for only 6 films of material. Overall this game is a must have for casual and obsessive Star Wars fans alike!",0
"Even though all the critics loved Ashley Judd's performance in ""Come Early Morning"" (and she even had some support for an Oscar nomination in 2006), others kept harping about how she has wasted her formidable talents in a flood of serial-killer genre movies. Well, she was in a total of three movies that involved serial killers and in one of those her scene wasn't used in the final film. The only reason she gets pegged as Thriller Chick is because those are the only films a mass audience has bothered to watch.Thanks to nonexistent media saturation, odds are that they'll miss this independent delight, too. Or if they do watch it, they'll hate it because of the bait-and-switch packaging it's received in its DVD release. The cover promises a light and airy, tied-up-in-a-neat-bow, rom-com confection that is miles removed from the scruffy, minimalist, starkly honest, fair-minded, and open-ended slice of semi-rural life that is contained inside.I love Ashley's work here. Adams' freshman directorial effort has a few rough edges but that's okay. Just watch it",0

"Holy moley.  This thing sucked rancid twinkies through a hot garden hose.  Even *if* you could get past the editing, there's the lighting.Even *if* you could get past the lighting, there's the problem with the audio being disastrously out of sync with the video (even in the first scene, when the flute player didn't even come close to keying with the notes...and on and on and on).Even *if* you got past the editing, lighting, and sync problems, you're still left with a bizarre egomaniac throwing himself around on stage.  No matter HOW good you think he is (and I do agree he's quite talented) it's obvious that Flatley thinks he's even better.  At the expense of the story, the cohesion, and at the expense of the viewers enjoyment, he's out to show how awesome he is.

"10 years ago, when I was 18, my father gave me this book as a gift the day my parents took me to college.  Although I thought it was ""uncool"", I also understood the meaning behind the gift.  He felt that this book could act as a moral guide when my parents could no longer be with me on a daily basis to be that moral compass.  And through the years, it has served as a source of inspiration, strength and comfort.  As an adult, I am more partial to the poetry and historical writings rather than the stories.  But as an expectant first time mother, I am looking forward to sharing the children's stories with my son when he's born, and throughout his life.  I think this book should be incorporated into children's lives from an early age, along with other children's stories.  This is a book children can grow with and enjoy even as adults...the writings take on new meaning as we age.  I highly recommend this book, despite Bill Bennett's personal mistakes.  There is too much value in this compilation of writings to deny our children the benefit to spite Mr. Bennett",1
"The Ennio Morricone soundtrack to 'Cinema Paradiso' is practically a co-star in the beautiful film. The soundtrack matches perfectly the innocence, pathos and joy portrayed on screen.

"Leading the change in the contemporary business environment, which is surcharged with  chaotic competition, is becoming a serious challenge for business as well as social organizations.  In this scenario, Best Practices in Leadership Development and Organizational Change is a significant contribution towards designing change efforts in variegated situations. The cases in it are illustrations of strategies, structures and processes of leading change management by some of the best performing global organizations. David Norton of the Balanced Score Card fame had rightly pointed out that ""managing strategy is, in essence, managing change."" The best practice cases mapped in the book tell us how this has actually happened in some of the most successful global organizations.    These narrations and analyses tell the reader the tools and methods used in leading the change processes and help her get the answers to several intriguing questions: why some leaders are able to use these tools to change more dramatically; how successful leaders conceive new ideas, engineer consensus on their adoption and internalize them throughout the length and breadth of the organization; the constant pull and trade-off between short-term and long-term viewpoints eventually leading to a strong management process; how visionary leaders took big and decisive moves; how sense of urgency could be nurtured  among individuals and teams; how change management processes could be linked with quantifiable business results; what are the critical success and failure factors in change efforts; how vision is created and communicated to give clear mandates to people; how resistance to change is overcome in short- and the long term;  and thus how change culture gets internalized to become a way of organizational life? In sum, the best practice cases remind us  that the key to effective leadership is to stay focused on change, making all others in the organization do the same, and eventually create excitement to remain committed to change.         This book is a useful new resource for thought and action leaders in developing competitive position in today's changing business environment.  It maps the emerging paradigm of leadership development for managing change. It helps the reader designing and implementing change initiatives and evaluating their effectiveness. The book  will be seen as a professional guide towards discovering winning and successful business strategies. Corporate leaders, CEOs, boards of directors and change masters, trainers, organizational development (OD) designers and project leaders have useful lessons to learn from these best practices. The case studies themselves show that each organization is distinct in adopting their change path, processes and methods. Yet they underscore that all organizations had constant willingness to learn. Some of the other commonalities among them included: collaboration, humility, ethical working, innovation, regard for people expectation and psyche, and passion for change.  Organizations across the globe will learn important how-to lessons about the contexts in which these virtues were demonstrated and how specific measurable results were realized through leading the change effort.Dr. Debi S.

"I own a language school for young children.  We give classes in several languages and I'm always looking for new materials.  I read about the Beth Manners CDs in Family Fun Magazine and I use all three Spanish CDs.  They are all very lively and really play to  young audiences.  The children adore the songs and all of the action.  The pronunciation is excellent - native-  using a South American accent typical of  Columbia, Puerto Rico and Mexico. Spanish is pronounced differently in the many regions where it is spoken.   It is important for children to hear and become comfortable with all of the pronunciations.  We hire teachers from different regions in our school.  I highly recommend these CDs.",1

In order to defeat Lyme - a very slow and frustrating process - i found it helpful to understand what exactly the body is fighting and the various wars it mounts against microbes.  Once you gain this understanding, you feel much more pro-active and self-dependent about conquering this illness.

"If you have read the great Flaubert novel and are expecting a film to equal it in its grandeur, then you may be disappointed. However, if you can  settle for a beautifully filmed Hollywoodized adaption of the novel, then  this is it. First of all, the cinematography and the sets are excellent.  You can tell that they are sets but they are very well done. The acting,  especially Jennifer Jones in the title role, is outstanding. Supporting  cast is fine also with the always memorable Gladys Cooper and the  incredibly handsome Louis Jourdan especially stand out. And look for Ellen  Corby (Grandma Walton) as the maid. Two scenes are highly notable - the  ball sequence is spectacular and the scene where Emma awaits Rodolphe on  the deserted windswept streets in the middle of the night is beautifully  done. Overall, a stunning acheivement by director Vincente Minnelli",0

"I've enjoyed reading a book with this light and using it to draw pictures during the night.  For books, it's more than enough light and is great at helping to hold the pages in a book while reading and the curved grip allows unheld pages to rest on top of it without bending them.  For drawing with a clipboard, it lights up about 3/4 of an 8.5x 11 sheet of paper with it set close to the paper.  Raise it a little and the light disperses enough to light the entire sheet of paper.  Not as bright the second way, but bright enough to use pencil lead on white paper.  I'm loving my new light, and so is my husband.  No more bright lights when he's trying to sleep :",0

"I never was keen on tackling auto electrics, so when car manufacturers began introducing  electronics, then computers, the eyes glazed over, and new car purchases were limited to pre -1976 models.  Then, while browsing, a book about my automotive twilight zone was offered.  It was described as understandable by trained monkeys. (or words to that effect.)   I knew that sub-contracting the electricals for my three planned &quot;clubman&quot; sportscars would stretch the budget.  I needed help.  The table of contents looked good, the editorial review looked promising, then my discovery that the author lived a localtelephone call away decided it for me.  If I couldn't understand his book, the author could hardly deny a plea for assistance.  I ordered a copy.  Good move!   After a short read, all my forebodings melted away.  Following the book, I sorted out the bats-nest of under-dash electricals in my work-truck with ease.  It looks a professional job, and I actually understood what I was doing and enjoyed doing it.  The book paid for itself many times over on that one job.  Instead of dreading the prospect, I'm now impatient to design and fabricate the wiring looms for my Toyota 4A-GE powered Locosts.  The &quot;black-boxes&quot; sprouting forests of wires no longer un-nerve me.   There are sections covering every aspect of such a project.  The required information is well-indexed, and is presented clearly and concisely.  When I first flipped through the book, I was almost overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information.  I soon discovered that it is one of the best reference books (of any subject) I have ever seen.  It is only necessary to know what you want to do, not how to do it.  Use the extensive index to find part of your project, and when you have a question, it will be the key to a cross-reference to the next step.  Wire gauges, fuse ratings, component specifications and limitations, safety requirements, sensors, diagnostics,...all are comprehensively dealt with in jargon free text that you and I (and trained monkeys and politicians probably) will find easy to follow.  Want to see for yourself?  Search the title, click on the &quot;table of contents&quot;.  Impressive.   I never did have to call Mr. Munday for help, but I called to thank him and ask how he was able to write such a perfect book.  He is a professional  freelance Technical Author  who writes  Technical Manuals, User Guides, Instructions, etc on almost any technical subject  to make them comprehensible forthe layman.(and trained monkeys and politicians)  His hobby is hot-rodding.

This is a truly wholistic book, addressing body, emotions, mind, relationships and spirit - both of the animals who were helped and of their owners.Schoen illustrates his work with many heartwarming stories of his challenges and adventures with animals and their owners.A typical example is Schoen's description of how he nursed a wild hawk who was paralyzed from the neck down following injuries from a power line. Schoen found ways to tame and heal this wary creature so that it could recover, eventually returning to his wilderness home. As with many of his animal patients, Schoen found himself learning and growing in the process of his ministrations."" ...no creature can remain forever closed to the healing power of love.  I knew that if I could establish an intimate relationship with a bird of prey, I could communicate with any animal, no matter how distant or fearsome it might appear to be.  All I would need was a sensitivity of spirit, a willingness to open myself nonjudgmentally to a dimension of reality where feathers, fur, skin, scales, or hair are stripped away - and where the only language is love.  ""Hawkeye had his freedom, and now I had mine.  He had given me my wings, and I was ready to soar."" (p. 71)This is an excellent book for anyone interested in learning about ways of healing that extend beyond conventional veterinary care.",1

"Wes is admittedly more ""aggressive"" in his playing on this occasion, partly due to his band mates and the nature and length of the program.  Unlike the grooving, always ""in the pocket,"" rhythm section of ""Smokin' at the Half Note"" (Kelly, Chambers, Cobb), the Harold Mabern-led rhythm section gives the music a forward edge, or emotive quality, suggestive of Coltrane and McCoy.  The result is often music based on tension and release rather than melodic inventiveness--leading to some purely ""physical"" playing and grandstanding on the parts of Mabern and tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin (the two ballads opening the second disk are my favorite moments of the concert).The audio is acceptable--and thankfully the balance favors Wes' guitar, which sounds as ""fat"" and consistent as ever.  But I suspect this recording won't wear as well with me and other non-guitarists as his meetings with Wynton Kelley, Milt Jackson, and Jimmy Smith, not to mention the classic Riverside studio albums.  If there were more of Wes on record, I'd give this one 4 stars.  Pick it up only if you have ""Smokin',"" ""Full House,"" and ""The Incredible Artistry.",0

"The book has a nice pace.  It is not a fat book. Content is presented succinctly. The platonic-type dialog is as charming as it is civilized and effective.  There is something inspirational about reading a treatise previously studied by people like Bach, Haydn, Mozart, etc.  I would say that even the most anti-traditional composer-person might benefit from the straightforward analytic of it all, even if one's harmonic sensibility differs from those presented in this text.  All in all, a book to check out, if counterpoint intrigues you",1
"Anyone wanting to explore the art of Hitchcock's movies doesn't have to look any further.  I have four large bookshelves stretching from floor to ceiling with nothing but books about Alfred Hitchcock so I'm posting my review of the three best books about Sir Alfred.  This is one of those three books.  Mr. Spoto has accomplished a superb analysis of the Master's films.  All you need to do is watch one of Hitchcock's movies, read a chapter describing that particular movie, and you'll realize just how crafty Hitchcock was when he designed and filmed his features.

"Being that I was born in the mid-eighties, I did not have the priveledge of growing up listening to music of this sort.  When I found this CD among my dad's collection I decided to give it a listen because I recognized some of the songs.  I'm very glad I did!I greatly enjoy almost all of the songs, in particular The Kinks ""All Day and All of the Night"" and ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" by the Tokens.The rest of the songs are top-notch ""oldies"" as well, easily recognizable classics. The only song I don't really care for is ""The Little Old Lady From Pasadena"" by Jan & Dean, though it is still an okay song.Overall, I would certainly recommend this CD... when you find one both a father and a daughter can easily enjoy together, it must be good",0

"Sombre Romantic is a step up if you will in the gothic metal genre. It is a very solid album from start to finish but has alot of layers that keep things interesting. Its not what you would really consider to be a ""religious"" album but there are many undertones that help get the message across. This point being made very clear in ""Museum of Iscariot"" which talks of Jesus from Judas' point of view.Rowan's vocal stylings change to meet the moods of every song on this album, from low opera type to screaming, in a superb way that stays consistent and never gets old. If you are into  relaxed darkwave/goth music this is a perfect album to purchase",0
"to one of the biggest gigs touring the world right now.The book, written in the best academese, presents a clear view of the West's distortion, and the history of that distortion-making, vis-à-vis Tibet and Tibet's version of Buddhism.The book is laid out into seven neat chapters, each bearing a single-word title that feels Borgesian in its cryptic minimalism. Each chapter deals with one of the events and objects that have structured for the West the illusion called Tibet. They are (and refer to): 1. The Name (the term `Lamaism')2. The Book  (The Tibetan Book of the Dead)3. The Eye  (the book, `The Third Eye' by T. Lobsang Rampa)4. The Spell  (the mantra Om Mani Padme Hum)5. The Art  (Thangkas, Mandalas, Wrathful Deities, Skull cups, etc)6. The Field  (of Buddhist Studies and Tibetology in the US)7. The Prison (the collective illusion regarding ""Tibet"" and her mysteries)Yes, the debunking is sobering as well as entertaining, as it is done with solid scholarly information delivered with biting wit and even Wildean sarcasm at times.But the most interesting things the author mentions are questions and remain still as questions: Namely, the question of Tibetan clergy's willing ""collusion"" or co-option of the West's tendency to ""psychologize"" the Buddhist doctrine. For example, there is a marked tendency on the part of the Tibetan Lamas and American academics to veer away from interpreting the Six Realms as anything more than so many ""psychological states"" in this present incarnation but that is certainly NOT the way most Tibetans have been taught. Moreover, there is a Dalai Lama approved move to present to the West a user-friendly version of Tibetan Buddhism that is totally devoid of the really weird stuff that ""formerly"" took up (and still takes up for the average Tibetan) the bulk of what that faith used to be all about ""back home"": exorcism, magic, animistic rituals, etc., stuff that would be totally unacceptable in the modern West. The last chapter deals a bit with the so-called Shugden Affair that may have played a part in the murder of an old Lama and his two students who supported the Dalai Lama's new policy (after consulting an oracle) to outlaw Shugden (a protecting deity of the Geluk sect) worship. This was not widely reported in the media but apparently this was/is a big deal among the Tibetans in the dressing room backstage even as they continue to put on a great show on stage.No doubt, Tibetan Buddhism, even in its Americanized (low fat, low salt, Stuart Smalley) version has something to offer to some people - if not to the West as a whole, then at least to the Tibetans' image. But are we in the West willing, ready, and daring enough to meet the Tibetans on their own religious turf and do what they do and eat what they eat, so to speak? If not, maybe going back to church and listening to a familiar sermon may not be entirely a bad idea for those who must have religion.Let's not forget, nobody in China has ever heard of, let alone eat, Chop Suey",1
"I read the entire series of these books within 2 months. My son brought it home one day, the next day my boss just happened to ask if I had read 'Left Behind' series. I said 'what?'

(My boss had all twelve in his desk cabinet)I think that even though this book is fiction, it gives an excellent picture of what could happen. Because...none of us truly know.

It is hard to find any military fiction writer like Gandt, can have so sophisticated description of portryal. One more, the story line between Maxwell and Philips is so real and attractive, mixing with sweet, pain and pity.Highly recommended to all military fiction readers, you should buy all the Robert Gandt books and read them one by one.",1

"One of the supposed reasons why ghosts remain in this world is that they were murdered, and want the world to know who did it. So expect a lot of that in ""The Changeling,"" a quiet, compelling ghost story that harkens back to old-fashioned chillers. No ghouls, buckets of blood, chainsaws or serial killers. Instead, this movie relies on outstanding acting, and a timeless feeling that permeates the simple story. And it'll scare the skin off you.John Russell (George C. Scott) is on a trip with his wife and daughter, when a freak car accident kills them both. Months later, the grieving composer moves to Seattle and rents an enormous historical house, trying to bury himself in his new job. But there are odd sounds and sights in his house -- faucets running, eerie voices the piano clashing, and a boy drowned in the tub.John becomes increasingly desperate to find out the truth, assisted by the real estate agent who got him the house (Trish Van Devere). With seances, visions and a well under the floorboards, he begins to piece together a terrible crime from many years ago -- and the ""changeling"" that the ghost wants revenge on.Anyone who wants blood, special effects and lots of screaming had better look elsewhere for their horror kicks. ""The Changeling"" is a very different kind of movie -- think Shirley Jackson, not Stephen King -- where a wheelchair rattling down the stairs is enough to make your hair stand on end. (And do I detect some influence on ""The Ring"" in certain scenes?)This movie also feels elegant and timeless. Old mossy mansions, horseback riding in damp forests, and a composer trying to overcome his grief. Peter Medak drapes the movie in beautiful visuals, and allows the viewers to get to know the characters before the plot really gets moving.Then ""The Changeling"" becomes creepy very fast. The plot grows more suspenseful with every scene, building with every new discovery -- a wheelchair, a baptismal medal, and a bathtub -- until something has to erupt. The ghost never appears except in flashbacks -- an appalling murder scene -- but his keening voice can be heard over and over. George C. Scott gives a pitch-perfect performance as the mild, slightly reclusive John, who is still suffering from his losses and trying to move on with his life. Van Devere comes across as a bit annoying at first, but she also serves as a good counterpoint to Scott, as well as a potential love interest whenever he's ready. Melvyn Douglas also has a good brief role as a politician with a deep dark secret.Less is more in ""The Changeling,"" a movie whose scares spring from its exceptional scripting, eerie ghost and great acting. Just don't watch this one alone in the house... at night",0

"""This is an unusually riveting, exuberant autobiography of a man who, in 1931, 'came out' in the streets of London as a self-confessed and self-evident homosexual. At a time when the slightest sign of homosexuality aroused immediate disgust, Quentin Crisp made the courageous decision to be true to his nature. He adopted an outrageously effeminate manner and appearance ('I wore makeup at a time when even on women eye shadow was sinful'), and his flamboyant exhibitionism, henna-dyed hair, and unconventional behavior shocked London society of the thirties. Though he was harassed, ridiculed, and beaten, he was determined to spread the message that homosexuality did not exclude him or anyone else from the human race. ¶ Quentin Crisp has become a cult celebrity since the highly acclaimed dramatization of The Naked Civil Servant was first aired on American television. His is a unique life story. One feels the strength and humor of an honest man, determined to face the world with the truth about himself.""--© zebraz",1

"I've dicovered that a LOT of people get downright angry when you start to elucidate Zen to be anything beyond ""do-your-own-thing"". I hope you're not going to be one of those people...I've owned this book for something like 10 years now and it is still enigmatic and at times unfriendly to me, but that is the nature of kung-an practice. There is a stubbornness to the Ancient kung-an that does not change readily, but does yield with time, though I think there is no real way to ""rush"" their clarification, and it is probably unwise to try to. The gong-an themselves are ample proof that intellect alone falls short when confronted with the patriarchs of the Ch'an path. Chinese Ch'an Master Sheng Yen says that to have good practice, realization and heart must go hand-in-hand. Having just the realization-hold-the-compassion won't produce the highest realization. If you think Zen is atheistic intellectualism, you're dead wrong. You're supposed to feel your heart when you have a Zen realization.Case: ""A monk asked Yun Men, ""What is every atom samadhi?"" Men said, ""Food in the bowl, water in the bucket."" Poetry succeeds where explanation fails. This is an appeal to the physical poetry of the immediate, while intimating that there is way more to the everyday immediate than was previously assumed in what Heidegger calls the ""Average Everydayness"" or mind-numbed, over-conditioned state of how we ordinarily tend to relate to the world. This is the key--the 20-ton key--to Ch'an that the intellect alone is too weak to wield. Case: ""Yun Men showed his staff to the assembly and said, ""The staff has changed into a dragon and swallowed the universe. Mountains, rivers, the great earth--where are they to be found?"" This gong-an actually pertains to the 4th of 5 levels of Samadhi in Ch'an, as explained by contemporary Ch'an Master Sheng Yen. This level is the all-wisdom phase where the world passes away from the mind as no longer real whatsoever. But there is still another level left to be explored, that of seeing the delusion of the world as enlightenment-waiting-to-be-transformed, and for this reason, one might suspect that these kung-an tend to be targeting different levels of Samadhi, since they obviously do not tend to address every level at once, except in the case that some of them address the last, arguably. Different gong-an are simply meant for different folks at different levels, some are keys for many levels at once. If you can accept this premise, there is a sudden cohesion in the collection and it's a worthwhile practice tool in this sense. If you expect every gong-an to make sense in terms of where you happen to be right now, then you are lost very quickly. ""Take what works for you"" is, roughly speaking, the essence of Zen and the essence of gong-an practice.",1
"Threatening Anthropology is an important book--one that I hope will signal a signicant change in the way the history of anthropology is written. Prior to Price, historians such as George Stocking have taken an apolitical view of anthropology's history. This is unfortunate in large part because many founding members of the discipline were politically active and engaged. The anthropologists paid a heavy price for this political activism--a point that Price drives home effectively. Encyclopedic in approach, Price does a great job outlining how politically active anthropologists were persecuted and lost their jobs--while the American Anthropology Associaltion looked on and did nothing. Based on extensive research via the FOIA, Price is to be commended for his efforts. While Price has focused on the larger issue of the Cold War, for those who want a case study see William Peace's biography of Leslie A. White. Hopefull the work of Peace and Price will inspire other anthropologists to take a closer look at the history of anthropology. Taken together, Price's and Peace's work will signal a new era in writing about anthropology's past",1
"Smarty Jones has proved to the critics that he is a true Champion, even though he was edged out in the Belmont.

The whole 'Seabiscuit'-type story remains to be told at the end of this colt's remarkable career",1
"Everyone has an understanding of emotion, but few people agree on what the word really means.  For example, how is  'emotion' differentiated from 'feeling'?  Are emotion and logic independent? This book should help you explore these questions.  Ekman starts with arguments for the universality of emotional display.   All humans produce the same facial displays when engaged in a moment of anger or sadness.  Reactive displays are generally 'honest' but fleeting.  All socially adept humans have learned to disguise their emotional displays.  Sometimes a high-speed camera is required to capture and 'freeze' the initial 'true' display.  Given the difficulty of 'real time' determination of an emotional display's meaning, Ekman standardizes his approach on a suitably literal plane.  For example, the raise eyebrow means 'X' in 'Y' percent of the population, but only 'Z' percent recognize it.Here is an outline of characteristics Ekman uses to define emotions:1. Emotions are experienced as feelings, a set of sensations that we experience and often are aware of.2. An emotional episode can be brief (less than a second to several seconds). If it is longer, it is a mood3. It is about something that matters to the person4. We experience them as happening to us, they are not chosen.5. We are constantly scanning our environment. Emotional responses are automatic reactions to these perceptions. In this sense, emotions are an 'early warning system'.  6. Refractory periods exist after the emotional response.  During this refractory period, only perceptions that supports the emotional response is considered.7. The refractory period may last a few minutes or much longer8. We generally become aware of an emotion only after our attention begins to review it in the past tense.  9. There are universal emotional themes. We become emotional about matters that were relevant to our ancestors as well as ones we have found to matter in our own lives.10. The desire to experience or not experience an emotion motivates much of behavior.11. An efficient signal, clear, rapid and universal, informs those that witness the display.  The knowledge gained makes social cooperation possible.All of this background information takes up the first 4 chapters.  Many readers will find this an unnecessary delay.  Much of this material seems to wander about in politically correct debates about 'why we can't all be nice', or 'can education ban anger?'. Many will find this clueless and banal, but there is a lot of useful material mixed in.  Take the time to suffer through it. The curious hand ringing over the 'value' of anger is a testimony to stifling academic conformity on US colleges.  Ekman is arguing there is a genetic componet to emotional IQ.  The thesis is politically incorrect and sure to ruin a promising academic career. I decided the author had to demonstrate his touchy-feely sensitivity so the academic 'children are blank slates' mob wouldn't hang him.Finally, on page 97, almost half way through the book, we get to the material most readers were looking for when they pulled the book off the shelf: reading emotional states from facial expression:  The first lesson is on 'Sadness and agony.'  The following chapter addresses 'Anger.'  In all, Ekman describes 6 emotions:1. Grief, sadness	2. Anger3. Surprise4. Contentment, Enjoyment, sensory pleasures: 	5. Fear6. Disgust, contempt	Ekman apologizes for avoiding any discussion of1. Envy2. Guilt, shame and embarrassment.	While exploring these emotions, Ekman uses the following format:1. A general description of the emotion2. A paragraph or two inviting the reader to 'make the face as a method of experiencing the emotion)3. A longer section, with photos and discussion of muscular mechanics, suggesting ways to recognize the facial displays associated with the emotion.4. A page or two on using the skill.  This is always a description of an interaction with a boss.  I didn't find these very useful.There seems to be a fundamental distinction between sadness and anger, one drives out the other.  Most people have heard of the 'fight/flight' dichotomy, but it turns out fight/flight emotions are very easily represented in the face simultaneously.  Sadness-Anger is a more telling distinction.  They don't coexist simultaneously.  One's emotions can swing from sadness to anger, and back, sometimes fairly quickly, but they don't show up on the face at the same time.The stark differences between the two, combined with the universality of expression, suggest expression and emotion are inextricably linked.  The author suggests making the expression of anger and/or sadness because making the expression produced the experience of that emotion.  Combine this with the fact that anger begets anger (both in the emotional individual and those that observe the sign) and sadness begets sadness and ultimately depression, and one can see that not only is the 'expression' the emotion, but the expression can drive the emotion.  Additionally, we respond entirely differently to sadness and anger.  When we see an expression of sadness, almost all are moved to comfort the sad individual.  This feeling is so strong that just looking at a photograph of a sad individual, particularly a familiar individual, elicits strong experiences of sadness in oneself.  When anger is expressed 'in the flesh', we may become enraged ourselves.  On the other hand, a photograph of rage rarely elicits rage all by itself.  For example, you can go to a tearjerker at the theatre and expect 50% of the crowd to be awash in tears.  A still photo of rage almost never elicits rage.  The viewer must know the individual's context in great detail to respond with rage.  On the other hand, people can be talked into rage (see mob behavior) with relatively little difficulty.

"I needed a watch that would stay with me all the time but not on my wrist, since a watch on my wrist tends to bother my typing.  I tried a pocket watch, which is decent, but I wanted to have something on the outside.  This watch is the best I found so far!  It is rugged and convenient.  It has useful functions such as a down counter, a timer, and an alarm.  The display has two positions, the reverse vertical position good for hanging on your belt hook (which is what I do) or the vertical position for hanging on other things (like bags, I suppose).  It's also inexpensive.  The only thing may be that this thing is not exactly beautiful, but on casual clothing I think it looks just fine",0

"This is one of the most marvelous (in all senses of the word) reading experiences I've had in a long time.  Thomson's book was originally published in the 1950's, but had fallen out of print and was resurrected through the efforts of Seamus Heaney, a friend of the author's who also provides a very helpful introduction.  As a child, Thomson became fascinated by legends of seals who transform themselves into human beings (or vice versa), and in pursuit of this interest he traveled into remote areas of Scotland and Ireland where these legends were still part of the living folk tradition.  But in the 1940's the tradition was dying out:  the educational system pressured children to speak English rather than Gaelic, and listening to the radio had superseded traditional entertainments such as storytelling.  Thomson's chapters depict a way of life that was already disappearing;  he conveys not only the stories themselves but the entire &quot;flavor&quot; of the storytelling -- the people who tell them, the phraseology they use, their audiences, and the smoky cottages and fishy seaside shacks where the stories are told.  His summary of the seal legends is fascinating, but the greatest pleasure of the book, for me, was its evocation of the world in which the legends arose.  I can't recommend this book highly enough.  (Suggested listening to accompany the final chapter:  &quot;The Song of the Seals&quot; from Matt Molloy's album &quot;Shadows on Stone.&quot;",1

"I teach third grade and just read ""The Stories Julian Tells"" to my students as a read-aloud.  They absolutely loved this book!  The five stories in the book each are a chapter, told from Julian's point of view.  Julian and his little brother, Huey, get into mischief, including eating the lemon pudding their father has lovingly made as a present for their mother.  The boys' parents teach them loving lessons whenever they get into trouble.  This is a book that celebrates the joys of childhood.  I want to read Ann Cameron's other books in the series now.  Ms. Cameron truly understands what makes good reading",1
"Lindner's first collection is a stunning first collection. She writes the kind of poetry that I really love, poetry that is sensuous, poetry that you can feel across the skin as you read it (her work reminds me very much of Kim Addonizio's and Kate Light's in this respect). In addition to the sensuality of her poetry, Lindner has a real feel for language and meter. Lindner's place in life as a woman, mother, and wife is very much felt in the subjects of her poems. And her word choice is astonishing. You get some great phrases in her poems(`the sky a blade/against my naked throat' -Midtown; `How smoothly the body seduces the mind.' -Condom). The middle section is a series of poems about Alma Mahler, told in a narrative sequence. This is a great first collection, and judging from the quality of these poems, I think we'll be hearing more of April Lindner in the future",1
"This book has many strengths, from the credentials of the experts included to the variety of the topics they have chosen to write about. For some of us, the words ""Improve Your Life"" are frightening because there is, of course, so much work to be done. David Riklan's book is accessible, though, for each topic is short, sweet and pragmatic. If you're a writer, turn to pages 384-386, where you'll find Kelly Robbins' thoughts about using your words to focus on your life's challenges. If you're struggling with relationships, John Gray has some excellent advice on page 266. I especially like Shirley Cheng's ""Dance With Your Heart"" essay on page 350 because it presents such a positive approach to life. When it comes to titles, Alan Cohen's ""Mistake Salad,"" is especially apt, and the words that follow are a great story with a thought-provoking question about the role of mistakes in our lives. Each of the essays in the book presents a bite-sized idea that, when pondered, makes for a very filling and nutritious meal",1
"The author blends a large amount of primary material composed of both interviews of formal members and Nazi records to present this thourough insight into what appears to be all aspects of the Hitler Youth.  Additionally, the author is an excellant writer who does not write on the HS level, nor does vomit vocabulary causing one to have to have a dictionary nearby as do so many other historians do.As mentioned above, the author relies on numerious primary sources in his book.  One of the strengths of this author is that he does not take an event and deem that a certain inference must be drawn.  He gives the evidence ot the reader, perhaps suggests several possible inferences and allows he reader to decide.  The author approached the critical issue of culpability for these teenagers in that way.  At face value, the book's breakdown looks oversimplified as it only contains six chapters under the most general headings.  As one reads it, one realizes how well the author makes these approach work.To summerize, in my humble opinion, I believe this author presented this subject in an extraordinary manner.  I do not pretend to be an expert on this eriod of history.  Still, I do have some academic backround in early 20th century history in Europe.  This has led to a lifetime of reading books dealing with that era.  In my humble opinion, this book will become one of the leading books in that area.Finally, I have to say I found the author's writing style and respect for the reader refreshing.  The author clearly does not presume to tell the reader what they must conclude and assumes the reader is capable of thought.  This author impressed so much that his other works have been placed on my reading and in his case, I will not worry that I am wasting 20 or 30 bucks at a pop",1
"Abel's Proof takes an interesting approach to mathematical writing. The author places all mathematical formulas and derivations in boxes that are separate from the flow of the text so you don't have to do the math if all you want is a knowledge of the history of this era in mathematics. The author does a great job of explaining this history, covering the story of the factoring of polynomials in general but focusing on the unsolvability of the quintic. Abel's life of poverty is covered in detail. There is a lot of mathematics, if you are interested, including how to factor a cubic polynomial and Abel's proof of the unsolvability of the quintic. I found the math somewhat hard to follow but worth the effort of doing so. I found Abel's story to be very sad. The book is worth reading just for his life story alone.",1
"It would be most gratifying to witness the wise and ancient ""Ramtha"" answering questions posed by credentialled experts in anthropology, archaeology, and other legitimate scientific fields...after all, ""Ramtha"" would be a font of valuable information about the location of Atlantis and customs, technology and mores of the world 35,000 years ago...things that could be verified in the field, right? Experts in these fields do know quite a bit about agriculture, clothing, tools, and other aspects of life 35 millenia ago--what a chance for ""Ramtha"" to contribute to our knowledge!  OR--better yet--why not let ""Ramtha"" take the ""Million Dollar"" challenge by the James Randi Educational Foundation? Surely ""Ramtha"" could breeze through that for all the world to see? Otherwise, one is inclined to believe that anybody could master a little stage training, alter their accent, spout vapid platitudes, and make a fortune off of ""channeling""...Hey, maybe I should give ""channeling"" a try!

"so I decided to pick up this DVD for a little comedy. Although I am not a fan of the spoiled rich girl type, I found it extremely funny and let myself laugh at someone whose problems are so inane.  No worries and not a care other than a broken nail; the world now seems a lighter place.",0
"pretty melodies, hard rocking guitars and drums, evocative lyrics.  centro-matic songs get stuck in your head pretty quickly.  they remind me of REM songs played in the style of crazy horse or pavement.   this is probably my favorite of their albums.  you can throw it on and listen start to finish without wanting to skip a song.  buy this CD and you'll achieve maximum sonic sweetness.also, see the band live if you get the chance.  they bring a bunch of extra rock to the songs when they play 'em live.

"I have studied many writings on Buddhism in a short period of time. This offering presents a clear perspective on the Buddha's teachings. The perspective is a very practical one. I found the emphasis on impermanence to be particularly insightful. Not the usual read on the practice of Buddhism. Sogyal Rinpoche had strong praise for Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse in his book ""The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying"". I am unfamiliar with the author, but his insights run very deep",1

"It's all true: Fiestaware is classic, colorful, beautiful, colorful, durable, colorful, microwave and dishwasher safe, colorful and just plain wonderful.  Buy some!A WORD OF CAUTION: the pictures here (at least, on my browser) do NOT match with the actual Fiesta colors.  If color is important to you, check out the dishes in person before placing your order!  I own the 4-piece set in Cinnabar, Scarlet, Persimmon, Sunflower, Shamrock, Juniper, Cobalt and Plum.  A vertiable rainbow in the cupboard. Food looks great on these plates (and after reading these reviews I'm pleased to discover that I'm not the only one who picks the plate color based on the menu!)  I'm also the proud owner of 4 large cobalt soup bowls, very handy for main-dish salads and juicy pasta sauces.  I'd love to see Homer Laughlin offer a different type of set - I rarely use the mugs from this 4-piece set, in fact I might actually offer them up on ebay -- but would delight in a small sauce dish or something instead",0

Amanda Pepper is a thirty-year-old unmarried English teacher at elitist Philadelphia Prep and an amateur detective. She is a very likeable heroine and the book is consistently funny throughout. It is easy to understand why the author received an Anthony Award for best first mystery for this novel,1
"I am glad &quot;Ms. 45&quot; is back on the shelf, because for a long time it was hard to find, certainly up here in Canada. This film is superior to &quot;Driller Killer&quot; in every way except for the lead track. Nothing touches the live performance of Tony Coca Cola and the Roosters playing The Grand Street Stomp. It is quite obvious in &quot;Ms. 45&quot; that that is not the sound of a trumpet. Anyway, for those who don't dig this, you can't tell me you can diss it. This, his second film, is night and day between &quot;Driller Killer&quot;. What an obvious improvement. I was hoping that the DVD wouldn't be Vanilla and have at least a directors commentary. &quot;Driller Killer's&quot; commentray is legendary. And while you could chalk this up as being the female version of &quot;Death Wish&quot; there are some elements here that make it a true horror flick. For all those who liked &quot;Eating Raoul&quot;, this is a must see. Suspension of disbelief is an obvious exercise here, but you won't be disappointed with it if this is your thing. See if you can spot Michael Richards as one of the extras at the Halloween party",0

"If you've ever wanted to know everything there possibly is to know about the Porsche 911, then this book is for you! Others may find it to be monotonous and boring. The book goes into great detail about every aspect of each model year 911. Paul Frere is a 911 expert and it shows! I didn't like that most of the pictures are in black and white, although there is a nice little color photo section in the middle of the book. Die hard fans of the 911 will LOVE it. Others may not",1
"What can you say about one of the greatest thinkers of alltime who inspired other greatest thinkers of alltime? Well, one could say that this book - which often isn't even listed as a work of his on certain lists (see wikipedia) is his very very best. By far the most insightful book ever written about how consciousness interacts with the reality of space-time. His thought provoking ideas into intentionalities and replaying memories is nothing short of amazing. The appendix to this book will take you a decade to absorb. Incredible thoughts for the late 1800's and early 1900's",1
"Pre-K. This lovely book by Lewis Kim is about Harry, a stuffed elephant. The author has written another Harry story called `My Friend Harry'. This book can be viewed as a sequel to that title. This is about Harry when James, Harry's owner, is not around. Harry's problem is that he cannot fell asleep. When Harry has trouble sleeping, he tries everything to make himself sleepy. He reads bedtime stories, cleans up the room, runs, and even jumps. Still unable to go to sleep, he becomes worried. His friends, Lulu, the sheep and, Ted, the teddy bear help Harry out. Finally, Harry fells fast asleep.Done with colored pencil and pastels, Kim Lewis's illustrations are soft and dreamy. Yet they are realistic enough so they lure us to touch them to see whether we can feel Harry and other friends' fluffiness. The story is a soothing and heart warming bedtime story. It encourages sleep for everyone who reads it, even for readers who are not yet sleepy. When you finish reading this book, you might want to peek at the stuffed animals in children's room to see if those toys are talking, moving around, and making themselves busy. I would highly recommend this book to readers in preschool to kindergarten. This charming book could make toddlers happy, too.",1
"This is one of Joe Satriani's finest moments.  He takes us on a journey 15 tracks strong.  This may not be my favorite Joe Satriani album, but it is still excellent.  I just prefer Surfing With The Alien and Flying in a Blue Dream over this one.  They are REALLY hard to top.  But have no fear, this album is great and worth a purchase, ESPECIALLY if you like electric guitar music.  Satriani shines",0
"I so enjoyed this series and couldn't wait to get to the next book.  I read all of them in order and was so pleased to find a series and heroine I was really excited about.  What a let down.  However, I persevered, read this book and went all the way to Cerulean Sins.  Now, I understand the negative reviews and other remarks by disappointed readers and fans.  I do not mind sexual influence when it adds to the story, character, whatever.  But, this is down right ridiculous.  I mean, give me a break here.   It was one reviewers opinion that the author refuses to listen to her fans opinions, I hope that is not the case and the plots get back on track and off the current story lines. Because I miss the original Anita and her stories",1

"This was when PBS and the CTW were making programs that were both ""educational"" and entertaining in all sense of the words.  Today, while PBS still does Children's Television, the programs are not quite as effective as the earlier shows were.  Seseme Street is still on, but replacement shows like those shows that are made by Scholastic Company, just do not have the same effective ability to get kids to learn, while shows like Seseme Street, The Electric Company, and Mr Rogers's Neighborhood did.Anyway Volume 2 of the Best of the Electric Company is being prepared for a DVD release, Like Volume One, it will also feature a selection of shows from the six seasons that it aired on PBS.  I understand Rita Moreno will host new episode Introductions to each episode.  A few more of the cast and crew will be interviewed in their work on the show (if only they could get Bill Cosby and Morgan Freeman to do interviews), and yes, more of the shows will feature Spider-Man segments",0

"Having only gone the audio book route for books of this nature in the past I wasn't sure how well I'd go with reading this even though I love reading.  Pleasantly suprised is the first accolade I can give this book!  Lynne creates here a book that takes much of the mysticisim out of the Law of Attraction and gives it a real science to hold on to.  After you read this you'll find yourself giving it to everyone to read - everyone should!  You'll also find yourself quoting it in casual conversation - something that you can't really do with the Hicks' work or with the Secret.  Lynne's research seems very complete though it does still take an incredibly open mind to wrap your head around the concepts here. However, if you have been trying to impliment intention setting in your life and want another approach, this gives you more than a helping hand - it builds you a nice sturdy stairway with a great bannister!  If you're already open to these ideas and looking for another point of view that has more of a footing in 'reality' then this is most definetly the book for you - it's incredibly well written, easy to follow and practical",1
"While many might feel that the term ""Sphaghetti Western"" connotes a type of substandard Western with low - production values and poor acting, I was pleasantly suprised with this title.  Eastwood and Van Cleef were credible in their roles, the plot was solid (although a little fantastic) and the settings were breathtaking, although clearly not filmed in the United States.  Whoever was behind the camera definitely had an eye for the natural beauty of what, to the more casual observer, might seem to be a manifestly desolate landscape.  Van Cleef performs his role so well that this series of movies seems to be tailormade for him.  Eastwood, while his performance seems somewhat stereotypical and unidimensional, is still superior to many of the actors of his day who played in westerns and some of the actors of our day.  All - in - all, this movie is definitely one that merits being added to your collection. ",0
Murrays book what it means to be a libertarian is great for someone who is curious about libertarism and wants to know more about it.  Murray outlines libertarian beliefs and values in a very simple structure that is an easy read. ,1
"The book defines (with illustrations) terms used to describe land features, such as barranca, grand bois, quaking bog.  It is primarily a book to dip into for fun or to consult as a reference.  If you like descriptive terms (e.g., meander scar) or puzzling friends with new words, you will like this book",1
" James Baldwin's stories are more like poetry, describing painful circumstances as dreamy metaphors. I felt myself pulled away from the story a few times to ponder what Baldwin is expressing through this story, for example he writes something about not choosing your friends or who you love, just as you don't get to choose your parents. He forces you to stand in the shoes of each character, feeling as though you were naked, because the message, for me at least, is clear. If people would allow themselves to feel total honesty with themselves, then perhaps the way they are choosing to live their lives would be completely, way over on the opposite end of the spectrum then what is actually real. No sexual orrient, race, religion. Just looking inside yourself and saying &quot;yes&quot;. And if you think I'm just getting to romantic over a story, still read this book. James Baldwin is a master at story telling. Even if you don't feel as I do about this book, I'm sure you'll feel something. It is, for me, one of those stories you thin kabout long after you've read it.",1
"Robin Hall packages his no-nonsense, nuts and bolts information in an easy to read, humorous format. Especially refreshing is the &quot;conversational&quot; tone of the text.

There are also lots of valuable tips from old (and not so old) pros in the business of cartooning and illustration. A valuable resource",1

"This is 600 pages of some guy building a boat. Elsewhere in the mystical land of Recluce a titanic battle is being fought across seas and continents -- but we don't get to see any of this, cause we're stuck watching this guy build his blasted boat. Eventually the war moves closer to home. Will the guy and his friends actually get caught up in an interesting plot? You needn't worry on that score, as Modesitt is able to quickly wrap everything up inside twenty pages. You quickly wonder why the rest of the story wasn't as short.Blame me if you like, I made no attempt to read the earlier volumes before starting this one. Still, Recluce on first blush seems a fairly whitebread, uninteresting fantasy world; the twin forces of Chaos and Order little more than Evil and Good, renamed; and Modesitt's present-tense prose more irritating than illuminating",1
"I find Mr. Lilley a very inspiring and knowledgeable author in the field of not only the business aspect, but of photography as well. I am also almost, an entirely self taught photographer, and, have been for over 25 years. It is truly refreshing to read such informative and confirming wisdom in the field of photography from another experienced photographer. I am in the process of starting my own studio at home and the information in this book is truly enlightening. I've not quite finished the book yet, but it gets better and better as you read through. Thanks Mr. Lilley for a great book",1

"As a futuristic tale Feed reads as a weak prediction of what might be, but understanding this future world is really an allegory for the present human condition rests my doubts.The characters inhabit a world largey created for them, their perceptions, interests and, ultimately, their values maintained and shaped by the Feed.  The Feed is a neural implant installed into a person's brain during early childhood, typically before all major brain regions have matured.  Humans are thus networked as nodes (or terminals) on a distributed computing system run by mega-corporations, irreversably fused with their feed implants.We explore what happens when people are separated from the Feed and how people choose to relate to reality.  This is not breaking new ground, but the delivery has style and wit.  I hoped the author would develop more elements of the story, such as the Coalition of Pity or the cause of the lesions.  But the story only lacks depth if compared to novels for well-read adults - keeping it clear is a wise strategy for a young adult novel and, with that audience in mind, it rates 5 stars.I'll be picking up more titles from this author and plan to have my children read this book when they're in high school",1
"  As somebody who has already collected the first nine volumes (with the tenth volume on pre-order), I can assure you that this series will not only grab you from the beginning, but consistently maintain it's excellent plot and characterization. This is my absolute favorite series! The characterization is rich, believable, and dynamic, the plot is laden with nuanced, unexpected twists and turns, and the art captures movement and emotions superbly (the character designs are some of the best that can be found in manga). Simply put... check this series out! XD",1

"These 2 discs do a superb job of showcasing that.   It takes a true artist to make a live record work; to make you feel like you're there at that show.   It works here, trust me; at the time this concert was recorded, my mommy hadn't even met my daddy.   I wasn't even an afterthought.   And yet, listening to this album, I can feel myself in that audience, yellin and screamin and singin and dancin and having a good time.   The way Waylon intended it to be.These songs are the cream of the crop, when it comes to country.   Waylon sure had a way with a song, what with that rough baritone of his, and his impressive guitar licks.   He could write a bit, true, but he relied heavily upon the help of other expert songwriters, people you are (or should be, at least) familiar with: Billy Joe Shaver, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, and, of course, wife Jessi Colter.   These are songs about loving and losing, cheating and drinking, living and dying--these are songs that represent the heart and soul of country music, as performed by one of country's all-time greatest pickers.   WAYLON LIVE is a must-have for country music fans...these two CD's prove, once and for all, that country music is where it's at.   And nobody knew that more than Waylon Jennings, thank God",0

"If you are going to Madrid there are two books minimum you must read before hand and take with you: Eyewitness Guide Madrid, and this Time Out Guide. I have been to Madrid several times and always take the most current version of the Time Out with me.To understand why the books are so good, you need to know that Madrid has the greatest number of bars and restaurants per capita of any city in the world. In Spain, the people of Madrid are given the nickname gatos, which means cats, because they stay up all night. They go to work at 8am, leave at noon, go home and sleep after the big meal of the day, return to work at 5pm, work until 9, leave work and go to tapas bars, where they have one drink and a snack, move to the next. Keep moving until around 11pm, when they stop for dinner, then it is off to a disco club, flamenco club, or a bar. But the same m.o.: in for a half hour or hour, then move on again. At 4:30 am on the weekends there are traffic jams because the streets are so busy. And I saw only one person who was drunk, that person undoubtable a tourist. The locals have fun, but behave themselves.This is why the Time Out guide is so valuable. Even if you dont want to stay up until 4 am, the Time Out guide assumes that just as important as the monuments and art musems, the lifestyle is a 'must do' part of your stay. The book has 109 pages devoted to details on cafes, bars, arts and enteratinment. There is another 22 pages just on shopping; the 18 pages of hotel listings are detailed and a good source of information. The first 34 pages do a solid job of covering history, architecture, and modern Madird; 44 well done pages on sightseeing sights. Although the Eyewitness Guides usually win the best map award, the maps in this guide I think are acutally a little better. Slightly larger and they include the bus routes.Two of my favorite places I found by reading this book, both on the same street 4 doors apart. The Time Out guide says ""CARDAMOMO, open 9pm-4am daily. If you've got any interest in flamenco or salsa, this is an essential stop. The dancing varies from eye-catchingly sensual to reassuringly clumsy. No one here gives fig about such niceties, and the gitano flavour ensures the music can't be resisted for long.""The other is ""EL BURLADERO open 3 to 3:30am daily. A packed two-storey locale off Plaza Santa Anna that's regularly full of copupes swinging each other round to flamenco, shouting Ole, and clapping. On the upper floor its calmer and a bit more space.""The descriptions are accurate, you wont find them in the other books. You would miss alot if you didn't have this book on your trip. When you go to Madrid, use the jet lag to your advantage; sleep in the middle of the day and early evening, get up at 10, go out for dinner, wander the Plaza Santa Ana area, catch a flamenco show, and see if Madrid isn't one of your all time favorite cities",1
"This manga series is about Negi Springfield, a ten-year-old wizard from Wales, who is assigned to teach at a girls middle school.  In this volume, Negi and his students are on a field trip.  Various plot complications ensue, such as a contest to see which girl will be first to kiss Negi, and battles with supernatural beings.  This is a very fun series that should appeal to fans of Love Hina.  The biggest problem with the comic is keeping track of who all the girls are.  But it's still a cute, funny, exciting story",1
"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax is the work in which Noam Chomsky first makes known his controversial theories of language.  The follow up to his primary work, Syntactic Structures, this work includes the introduction of  such concepts as Deep Structure, Universal Grammar, and makes clear the  realtionship between grammar and meaning.   This is also the work which  sparked the &quot;generative semantics&quot; debate that charged all  through the 1970's.  If you are a linguist, you must read this book.  The  theory may be outdated, but the history is the real importance. Besides,  it's written by Chomsky, so the language is sure to be as powerful as it is  clear and concise",1
"Other than a book I tried reading when I was in 6th grade, this is the first time I actually stopped reading a book mid-way through.  The writing is so elementary, you'd think a 13-year-old with a filthy vocabulary wrote this.  The story, at least up until about page 100, just kept re-emphasizing the girl's size.  Enough already!  The interaction between Jennifer and Cherica is so far-fetched, at least from my experience (and I have some raunchy friends who'll let anything fly), that it was totally unbelievable that friends would talk that way to one another.  Rick's mother sees Jennifer for what seems like 30 seconds or less and she already loves her?  Her first question to her was something like what her goal in life was?  I've met a few mothers in my time and never once, not once, was that even near the first question.  I was so totally disappointed with this book.  I honestly can not believe others actually rated it with five stars.  I would have given it a negative 5 if that option was available....AMAZON should at least offer ZERO stars for ratings.Folks, please do not waste your time or money on this book.  If it's Ms. Lee's 1st attempt, maybe she'll get better.  Heck, she can only improve I'm guessing because I don't think it could get any worse.  Also, the editor missed the boat on this one....way too many typos.  But, if you are still inclined, email me.  I'll send you my copy free of charge.  I wouldn't dare take someone's hard earned money for something that's only worthy of lining a bird cage",1
"I have reviewed several Haggard CDs (click on my name to see the others) and most get high marks, but this one is probably my personal favorite. The Strangers were at the height of their powers and the songwriting is some of Hag's best. Footlights is a musician's song. It has been described well in a prior review and is popular among most of those who've heard it. &quot;Red Bandana&quot; is a great song about ex-wife Bonnie Owens, who still travels with him. It has one of the great references in country songwriting, &quot;You ain't never gonna be no Bobby McGee, but you're tryin' to&quot;. &quot;My Own Kind of Hat&quot; is a fan favorite. The lyrics (&quot;Cowboys and Outlaws, right guys and southpaws...&quot;) take a playful swipe at the then popular Outlaw movement in country music. The guitar work of these two songs in particular is some of the best of Hag's career. &quot;Roses in the Winter&quot; is one of Hag's least known ballads, and one of my favorites.

"My husband has the metal version of these that are a bit higher and thinner.  He got them from a sports store in the weight dept.  I have also used regular dumbells which work fine because they are a bit thicker to hold so I find them more comfortable.  When I got these, I was very impressed.  They are more stable, so if you go real wide or real close they don't roll on their sides.  The grip is also soft and thick making it LOTS more comfortable.  I don't have near as much pain in my wrist doing push-ups of any type.  I highly recommend them, especially for women",0

"Tolstoy is just powerful...with his words. He talks about everything, describes every aspect of the surrounding down to the very last intricate detail. The result? An extremely enthralling and moving book. Apart from the widely discussed infidelity and love themes, this book manages to transport the reader to Russia in the 19th century, and to blend into the background whilst Anna and Vronsky's sordid affair takes place. The translation was wonderful; it is hard to believe that this isn't the original. I did however, wish I knew Russian so I could experience Tolstoy's actual work. I loved this book. I read it long before Oprah decided to add it to her book club, and so I have the Oxford Classics edition, which isn't as nice to look at and the translation is slightly different. This however, does not influence the book's distinction as one of greatest novels ever written",1
"Chris Matthews, the host of Hardball, clearly composed a masterwork in ""Nixon & Kennedy"".  The book is well written and manages to take a non-partisan look at the rivalry.  While the book is clearly not a complete biography of either man's life, the unique angle of the politcal rivalry between these men should be pleasing to readers of history.Nixon and Kennedy could not be more different in their backgrounds.  Kennedy came from a wealthy background, while Nixon was not nearly as fortunate.  Despite their differences, they developed a mutual admiration for one another after they entered congress in 1947.  Both Nixon and Kennedy were viewed as up and comers for their respective parties, curious as to who would go farther in his career first.  Their rivalry came to a tragic end when JFK was assassinated in 1963.  Yet the rivalry lived on through other member of the Kennedy family.  First, the spector of Bobby Kennedy running off of his brother's legacy frightened Nixon.  RFK's assassination would extinguish any Nixon versus RFK poltical battles before they came to fruition.  Without a Kennedy in the way, Nixon was able to win the White House.  Even after the first term in office, Nixon's biggest threat was another Kennedy.  While Ted Kennedy's Presidential aspirations were evaporated by a car accident, Nixon continued to feel threatened.  These feelings of inferiority led Nixon's administration to the dirty deeds involved in Watergate.  Ironically, Ted Kennedy led the charge that ended Nixon's Presidency through his resignation.Matthews goes into surprising detail on a number of topics in the book.  I found the chapters on Watergate to be more thorough than many sources.  The overall picture is a revealling look into American politics in the 1960's and 1970's.  Truly, I took great pleasure in reading this book",1

I LOVE Sue's unfortunate buddy, Cathy - ""You got all the brains, and all I got is [giggles] what I got!""!! The moment when she ""uncovers"" the truth about Joan of Arc is chilling, along with its repercussions. The bonus film, 1933's ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"", is quite good! I love that it is 20 years older than ""House of Wax"", yet it is set in then-present-day 1933, whereas ""House of Wax"" is set at the turn of the 20th century. I find the older film a bit spookier! Both are highly enjoyable, and I recommend you watch 'em :",0

"There's not much question that the 20 volume set of the Oxford English Dictionary (Second Edition) sets the standard for all other dictionaries to follow. There are, however, some associated questions. First, how good is the cd version? Version 3.0 is still a bit risky due to technical issues - ok for the daring, devoted, but probably not tame enough for the technological faint-of-heart. Second, what to get with the large set? Try ""A Guide to the Oxford English Dictionary,"" by Donna Lee Berg. Third, what if the 20 volume set is too pricey? Well, there is the 20 volumes crunched into 1 volume for the very keen eyed; there is also the 2 volume ""Shorter Oxford English Dictionary"" with fewer entries; and for the Webster's fans, there is always the ""Webster's Third New International Dictionary.",1

"Virtual machines and virtualization are a hot topics in the IT industry today. This is a perfect book and a very good introduction to the topic if you consider programming your own virtual machine. This is also a good introduction for you want to understant the techology behind modern virtual machines. I have a few virtual machine related books in my self and this is the best general introduction to virtual machines. The book deals with practical problems related to implementing your own virtual machine and improving its performance. If you are just interested in virtualization of your current hardware to support multiple operating systems using virtualization software such as VMWare, Xen or Microsoft Virtual Server, then this defenitely is NOT the book for you! If your main interest is on the Java Virtual Machine, then you should consider purchasing Java VM specific book such as Java Virtual Machine Specification.",1

"Are fluent in the Java language and have some practical experience in developing business solutions? If you are, then this book is for you. Authors Bill Burke and Richard Monson-Haefel, have done an outstanding job of writing a 5th edition of a book that provides a straight forward, no-nonsense explanation of the underlying technology, Java classes and interfaces, the component model, and the runtime behavior of EJB.Burke and Monson-Haefel, begin by defining component transaction monitors and explain how they form the underlying technology of the EJB component model. Then, the authors defines the architecture of the EJB component model and examine the differences between the three basic types of enterprise beans: entity beans, session beans, and message-driven beans. Next, they explain how the EJB-compliant server manages an enterprise bean at runtime. The authors then walk you through the development of some simple enterprise and entity beans. They continue by explaining how entity beans interact with the new entity manager service. Then, they define the basic relational database mapping provided by the Java Persistence specifications. Next, the authors expand your understanding of persistence and complex bean-to-bean relationships. The authors then discuss entity bean inheritance and how an object hierarchy can be mapped to a relational database. They continue by addressing the EJB QL, which is used to query entity beans and to locate specific entity beans in Java Persistence. Then, the authors cover the life cycle of an entity bean and how you can write classes that can intercept entity life cycle events. Next, they show you how to develop stateless and stateful session beans. The authors then show you how to develop message-driven beans. They continue by showing you how to use the Timer Service in EJB 3.0. Then, the authors explain the JNDI ENC as well as the new injection annotations and their XML equivalents. Next, they discuss EJB interceptors and how you can use them to extend the behavior of your EJB container. The authors then provide an in-depth explanation of transactions and describe the transactional model defined by EJB. Then, they walk you through the basics of EJB security. Next, the authors explain the XML, SOAP, WSLD, and UDDI web services standards. They continue by discussing how the JAX-RPC API supports web services in EJB. Then, the authors provide an overview of Java EE 5 and explain how EJB 3.0 fits into this new platform. Finally, they provide the basic design strategies that can simplify your EJB development efforts and make your EJB system more efficient.This most excellent book is organized into two parts: the technical manuscript (of which I have just covered), which is followed by the JBoss workbook. More importantly, the JBoss workbook provides step-by-step instructions for installing, configuring, and running the examples from the manuscript on the JBoss 4.0 Application Server",1

" First of all, c'mon- the price is right! A mere 5 bones for a remastered J. Lee Hooker studio release? Pick up 2 other blues CDs that you've been thinking about getting and toss this one in too, just so's you get the free shipping! There! It's payed for itself. I guarantee you will play the hell out of this. A great gift for young ones who you want to inculcate with the blues aesthetic! And who could resist a CD titled, ""It serves you right to suffer?"" That's just the bluesiest damn title the world has seen!The playing and sound are top-notch Hooker, in his mid 1960's prime. Yes, you can get some of these tracks on 'Best Of' comps- but still, the gestalt of the album is a thing to behold: this is one set that can't be reduced to its parts. It's the sum here that matters- and what you get is one of the finest blues releases out there (again, for 5 frikkin dollars!)... The hook's Lanky, brooding boogie shuffle- ably backed by some guys who know their place and don't step out of line...Seriously- if you ended up here- it's cuz you dig that John Lee Hooker sound. Maybe you averted your eyes (like I did) back when he was hawkin Pepsi in the mid-90's in those awful commercials... Well, friends, this is the antidote to crud like that.

The book is divided into chapters and at the end of each chapter is some 'homework'...it is great  because besides addressing the physical reasons for being undersatisfied in bed it also  addresses the emotional,mental, and spiritual aspects which could be hindering your intimate relationship...something that none of the other self help books my husband and I have read together have addressed.

"This is surely one of the worst books ever written. By anyone. Ever. And this was a best-seller in the US?!! Read it and weep. The book's title is remarkably telling, in fact telling you all you need to know about it. Charen uses the phrase ""useful idiots"" to describe those on the left in non-communist countries, apparently because that's what Lenin called them. Except that he didn't! As the author useful mentions on page 10, ""Lenin may never have actually uttered the phrase"". Hilarious! I might well write my own book in the future, called ""Simple-minded Idiots"", because Ronald Reagan once said that about Republicans. (Well, he might have done.)This book is only really useful as an illustration of the delusional power of ideology. Charen's attempted trashing of leftist views involves her deploying some highly dubious assertions, which simply don't accord with historical accuracy. For instance, the suggestion that American soldiers were not ""particularly nasty"" to Vietnamese peasants, and that South Vietnam was a viable democratic state (other than an artificial creation borne of the US supporting French colonialism after 1945). (Read George C. Herring's 'The Longest War' for a reasonable account of Vietnam, or else John Pilger's brilliant analysis in 'Heroes'.)I have given sections of this book to my History students after we have discussed aspects of the Cold War so that they can see how contemporary right-wing Amerians think, and they are truly shocked. Charen's text reads as plausible argument, but it's only when you read proper history books that you can see how insidious it really is. The frightening thing is that so many Americans are willing to be taken in by this rubbish. But that's the power of ideology for you! ['ideology': ideas serving as weapons for social interests. (Berger & Luckman 1966: The Social Construction of Reality, p.18)]I had to laugh at this rubbish, otherwise I'd cry.",1
"Opera in sound alone can never be the full monty, just as Shakespeare on the radio can't be. The grander the Grand Opera the more true this is, and Don Carlo is bigger in scope even than Aida. It is about a lot more than the story of a love-triangle set against a background of armies, slaves, pyramids and elephants: there are four parties to the love-interest alone, the role of Posa is nearly as important as any of them, and the action takes in the fate of the royal house of Spain, the imperial dominion in Flanders and the overweening power of the Spanish Inquisition. It cries out for staging. However in sound alone the Grand Inquisitor without his garb will have difficulty in being more than a disembodied bass voice given that his is a rather small part, and however dramatically kings, princes, princesses and nobles sing and act with their voices I can't help finding myself more concerned with them as sopranos, tenors, baritones and basses than as the dramatis personae they would be for me in the opera house.When recommending a Don Carlo on disc I therefore focus mainly on the musical side. In any case there is no possible risk that if this music is sung properly it will come across as a concert - Verdi sees to that. He was a dramatist to the marrow of his bones, and the listener at home has only to follow the words in order to be caught up in the grand sombre tragedy that Verdi has burned into music. The best performance on disc, for me, will be the performance that most consistently conveys both power and beauty, because this opera is about tormented human emotions at the mercy of ruthless political power in addition to their own tragic fallibility. None of that needs any staging when conveyed in music like this. It would be a tall order to expect any performance of this outsize opera to be perfect. It is not a perfect work itself, on any showing. Even by Verdi's standards it went through an enormous amount of rethinking and revision, and it has surely the most peculiar and unconvincing conclusion there can ever have been in a work of its stature. A worthy performance has to convey total and absolute belief and commitment, but the focus has to be on beauty as well, more than would be so in the opera house, because sound is all we have. One doesn't have to get far into the first act to realise that this Don Carlo is going to score quite exceptionally highly in point of beauty. Domingo is in superb voice, and Caballe surpasses herself. As the work goes on I suppose it might be fair to say that her lower register is not the equal of her higher, but this is Verdi and not Wagner. Wagner pitches his solo parts reasonably so as not to put strain on the voices, Verdi exploits the upper range of every voice except the bass with remorseless partiality, and Caballe rises to his monstrous demands magnificently. Eboli is a mezzo role, but the challenge Verrett has to overcome is hardly less in that respect, and her confession of the theft of the jewel-box is perhaps the final solo gem in a performance that is a jewel-box itself. Not everyone is absolutely right - the Grand Inquisitor's voice is too youthful, but I have very little criticism indeed to make of any of the major roles. Raimondi as the king seems perfectly good to me, and Milnes delivers a fine rendering of the part of Posa, combining power and inwardness, sometimes at one and the same time. If there is a high spot to the entire performance it is surely the quartet in act IV, a sublime outpouring of beautiful sound from all the principals together. In the last analysis this Don Carlo surpasses any other I have ever heard for its combination of sheer beauty with wholehearted power. Giulini was born to conduct it, and I doubt I have a single criticism of anything he does from start to finish. The recording is now 35 years old, but you might not be able to tell. Now only weeks from Giulini's passing I am especially glad to be able to give such an unqualified endorsement to what I believe to be one of his finest achievements, indeed one of the finest opera recordings I know. It's only to be expected that there are details that one prefers in other accounts, but for sheer consistent quality at the highest level I would say your search can safely end here",0

"I was told about this band ages ago from a friend of my sisters. I like all kinds of bands, except EMO, and this is one of my favourites. The music is beautiful and very different to anything else i've heard. One of the stand out tracks would have to be 'Rebellion (lies)' but when you listen to the cd a couple times you'll find that every track is a masterpiece in itself. I seriously recommend giving these guys and girl a listen a few times before deciding whether you like or hate them. In some ways they are very different to most bands, and i especially like how in this album every song seems to get faster in the last minute of each track. I saw them perform live once and it was really cool, especially with the whole drumming on ppl wearing helmets on their heads. In a way the singer kinda reminds me of the singer of Talking Heads (David Burne), another exceptionally cool band. Overall, give them a try and listen to them more then once before you decide you dont like them. Most ppl drawn to this band (whether by word of mouth or something else, wont be dissappointed). Arcade Fire for the win",0
"With their third release, Godsmack really shines, harder and better than ever before. A strong, radio-ready hit opens the album with ""Straight Out of Line"". Godsmack continues the energy rise with the next two tracks, ""Faceless"", and ""Changes"". And perhaps the most powerful song they've ever recorded comes into play at #5, ""I Stand Alone"", in my opinion, one of the best heavy rock songs ever recorded. They continue the awesome song trend with ""Re-Align"", a softer side where the lyrics absolutely shine. Next, a throwback to their debut with ""I F*****g Hate You"", an angry song that bristles with tension and malice. Another stand-out is ""I Am"", in which lead singer Sully Erna declares ""death will come when i'm good and God d**n ready"". And Godsmack does it again with the melodic, almost tribal ""Serenity"", where the chanting chorus can make your heart pump with intensity. Overall, this is their best record yet and an excellent purchase. This album apppeals to all rock fans who love quality music. An awesome album",0

Truly the heighth of adventure, Conan has to face a terrible Cthulhu monster and a giant grim idol of Nyarlathotep, all for the sake of the unthinkable emerald lotus, a plant and drug that came down from the stars in ages past that gives its user unlimited magic power and a inescapably deadly addiction.

While there is a sizable amount of material focused on poker, it is not all hold'em either, it is really two great stories woven into one book.The recounting of Annie's win of her WSOP bracelet in Omaha 8 is well told and interesting.  There isn't too big a focus on hand-by-hand play.  The tips she gives on this form of poker are great, too.  This part of the book fueled my interest in expanding my poker prowess into this game.The other story is Annie's bio.  I was really intrigued to read about the roots she came from to the bracelet winning pro poker player she is today.

"Given the challenges faced by the U.S. armed forces and our government in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans (still) and, possibly soon, in Africa, this book is as timely in its subject matter as it is sensible and useful.  The editors (de Jong, Platje and America's inimitable Robert Steele) have assembled subject matter experts from almost a dozen countries with peacekeeping experience, and they've done a fine job of keeping the entries clear, readable and focused.  Having worked in intelligence for over two decades myself, I can attest that the deep human challenges of intelligence operations during peacekeeping and peacemaking operations remain insufficiently met by our own or other intelligence bureaucracies.  It's not a matter of failure, but of (too often) mediocrity and inadequacy in the clinch.  Intelligence systems that are still haunted by the legacies of Cold War hardware and, worse, Cold War thinking still have not adapted adequately to our grave new world. We're learning, but perhaps not quickly enough. Steele, especially, has campaigned boldly in the cause of using open-source material to supplement classified data--and, in some cases, to supplant it--and we may expect powerful results wherever his advice is taken to heart.  Overall, this is a valuable, useful, thoughtful book one can strongly recommend both for professionals in the field and interested citizens.  Well done",1

"...I'm the only one who noticed that, besides the satire about managements, unions, and their relations, there is also one, although briefer nonetheless most interesting, about 'Justice', who decides that if one is guilty of honesty, it can only happen by reason of insanity, and, therefore must be committed. Leaving management going on with their cheating schemes, workers thinking that getting their paycheck is working hard enough, and unions' leaders going on encouraging sabotage, following USSR directions, absolutely blind to the fact that, if doing one tenth of the same stuff in USSR, they would have been -at best- sent to the siberian salt mines used as reeducation camps",0

This corporate coup of America's republic is something that several presidents have warned us about, including Andrew Jackson who in a speech to Congress said: ""At this point, the question is distinctly presented whether the people of the United States are to govern through representatives chosen by their unbiased suffrages (votes) or whether the money and power of a great corporation are to be secretly exerted to influence their judgment and control their decisions.""The national political discussion has regressed in many ways, with clever establishment propagandists like Hugh Hewitt, Fred Barnes and countless industry think tanks exerting all sorts of influence, and colonizing the minds of many vulnerable people.I actually kind of like Bush on a personal level.  His Crawford ranch home is a model of green architecture, and an article in ""Solar Today"" mentions that he put solar panels back on the White House (at the prodding of Laura).  Bush also has said kind things about Muslims and undocumented migrants, two groups that many of his followers routinely disrespect in a most unchristian manner.  But, whether one likes or dislikes Bush is irrelevant to the workings of power.  We need to pay less attention to individuals, and more to institutions.  To that end, I'd recommend the DVD ""The Corporation,"" as well as the books and radio show of Thom Hartmann.""If we understand the mechanism and motives of the group mind, it is now possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without their knowing it.""  - Edward Bernays, public relations pioneer.See ""Adbusters"" for all sorts of analysis of propaganda, and to begin protecting your children from it.",1

"This is the most inspirational book I have read in a long time.  The seven steps are mroe believable than other books I've read because the author went through it. I was tired of hearing advice from doctors and PhD's who  know what to say, but cannot understand unless they are actually in it. The  author has multiple sclerosis and is confined to a wheelchair- so I thought  to myself, if she can overcome her illness, so can I. Thanks to this book I  realized that just because my life has changed doesn't mean it has stopped",1

"This toy box as well of the rest of the mission set from Little Tike is excellant!! The quality is superperb. All pieces are solid wood not cheap veneers...the only exception is the hollow core toy box top WHICH MAKES SENSE!!! I would not want a solid oak toy box top of that size slamming on my 6 year old, 3 year old, or 1 year old's head. There is also a divot in the top edge of all sides so than fingers don't get pinched. The top still holds all three of my children with no problem, a combined weight of 120lbs.

"This book has two purposes: First, this book will tell you how to install, configure, and troubleshoot a vendor-independent computer network. Note the words vendor-independent. The modern company may well find itself with a NetWare network in accounting, Apples in marketing, Unix/Linux on the servers, and of course PC's. Not too many books cover all of these together. That's both together in the book and together in the network. Second, this book is also styled as a study guide to the CompTIA Network+ 2005 certification exam. It has sample questions and a general approach that is consistent with the CompTIA philosophy. Tamara Dean has worked in networking for over 14 years in a wide variety of companies and organizations. She has implemented the kinds of systems that she is writing about here. She is also a skilled writer, having written books several networking guides before. This has given her an understanding of what the reader needs and she has included this understanding in this book",1
"Weart's Nuclear Fear offers a history of nuclear energy viewed through the lens of popular mythology, discussing how images, fears, and fantasies as old as humanity have shaped both public and expert perceptions of the atomic age.  The history of nuclear energy is charged with strongly-held convictions and value-laden analyses.  Amid this conflagration, it's reassuring to find an account that not only approaches the issue from a unique and fascinating perspective, but does so in an even-handed way.  Weart delivers on both these counts, staying the course of reasoned analyses, dispassionate as can be demanded of any account which must necessarily dive elbow deep into the discussion of subjective human values.I have a specific fascination with representations of nuclear technology in popular culture.  In that capacity this book is everything I could have hoped for in a secondary source.  Nuclear history has precious few scholarly discussions of the avenues by which such a powerful psychological image is manifested in a wider cultural context, and as a definitive account, one could ask for no better than Weart's.This book's only shortcoming is one for which the author can't be blamed: the publication date.  The end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union add yet another dimension to the discussion.  Nuclear fear is alive and well today; and it has no doubt taken some interesting twists and turns since the late 80s.This is a must-read for any student of nuclear energy or weaponry, if only because if offers such a fresh perspective.  The histories of the subject's political and scientific components are well-explored, but Weart makes a compelling case that these avenues are by no means exhaustive",1
"This is Ratt's first full length album and second overall. Ratt's sound at the time was raw heavy metal with shredding solos, raspy vocals and catchy riffs and choruses. There isn't nearly as much pop metal on this album as there is on future albums.1.Wanted Man- A great hard rocking song. The heavy riff and catchy chorus make this a classic metal song. The lyrics are cool and the vocals sound good. The duel guitar solo is excellent and Warren trades off with Robbin perfectly as he finishes hi part of the solo with the fastest part of either solo and Robbin takes it from there and throws in some tasteful playing. The second biggest hit off the album and a classic!2.You're in Trouble- 10/10 Another killer song. The song starts off with just bass and drums. Pearcy's vocals sound good and the lyrics are cool. The chorus is very good and the guitar solo is excellent. A classic!3.Round and Round- 10/10 Another great song. By far the biggest hit of Ratt's career. The chorus and riff are catchy as hell. Not as heavy or raw as the first 2 songs but still a great song. The 1st guitar solo is excellent as Warren shreds his ass off before Robbin comes in for the awesome melodic harmony section. The song finishs off with another great solo. A killer pop metal song.4.In Your Direction- 9/10 A great song. The riffs are great and the chorus is catchy as hell. The shredding guitar solo is excellent and sounds exactly like George Lynch. A great catchy song.5.She Wants Money- 10/10 A great fast high energy song. The riffs rock and Stephen's vocals sound great. Another great guitar solo and chorus.6.Lack of Communication- 9/10 Another killer song. The riff is heavy and catchy and the chorus is one of my favorites on the album. Stephen's vocals sound good too.7.Back for More- 10/10 One of my favorites on the album. The heavy palm muted riff rocks and the chorus is cool. Stephen's vocals sound good once again. The solo shreds too.8.The Morning After- 10/10 A classic! This fast paced song is one of my favorite Ratt songs.  The chorus is catchy as hell and the vocals sound really good. The riff is one of my favorites too. Warren's solo shreds and sounds exactly like George Lynch and Robbin comes in for another great harmony.9.I'm Insane- 10/10 Another great fast song. The riff and chorus are great and Stephen's vocals sound good. Another great shredding solo too. This is Ratt at there best.10.Scene of the Crime- 9/10 A good pop metal song to close the album. The riff is catchy and so is the chorus. The harmony solo is great and Warren ends it with a killer shredding line. The second solo shreds and once again has a great harmony line.This is a classic 80's metal album. The riffs are excellent and Warren's solos are amazing. Ratt had one of the best duel guitar attacks of the 80's and Stephen Pearcy's voice was very unique. this album has plenty of classics, no fillers and some hit songs. This Ratt's best album in my opinion. Similar albums to this are.Dokken- Tooth And NailMotley Crue- Shout At The DevilRatt- Invasion Of Your Privacy, Self Titled E.PGuns N Roses- Appetite For DestructionVan Halen- Van HalenStephen Pearcy- VocalsWarren DeMartini- Guitar, Backround VocalsRobbin Crosby- Guitar, Backround VocalsBobby Blotzer- Drums PercussionJuan Croucier- Bass, Backround Vocal",0
"This has become the most consulted cookbook in our household. My Iranian partner loves to cook and he regularly spoils our guests with beautiful Persian dishes overwhelming them with the variety of colours and flavours of his home country. The beauty of Iranian food is in the diversity of flavours. Fresh herbs, aka sabzi are served with most meals.  The ways of cooking eggplant are stupendous and once you serve the eggplant dip to your friends or enjoy a fresh herb kuku - an omelette made with an amazing amount of fresh herbs you will wonder why you haven't always eaten persian food. Iranian cooks don't use djheera, chiles or other spices often used in Middle Eastern/Arabian food  - ie if you own books on Moroccan/Lebanese/Egyptian, Israeli/Turkish/Greek cuisine some of which are closely related  buying this book will add a totally new dimension to your collection, with few overlapping recipes. Iranian food is not hot the spices bring out aspects of the single dish components that will wow you. Saffron is used a lot and fresh herbs find their way into everything, I recommend you plant your own if you plan on cooking a lot of Iranian food.This exquisite book celebrates Iranian culture and food, it contains many recipes, beautiful pictures and information on ceremonies, poems and lists of herbs and vegetables, listing both the farsi and English names, which is helpful when seeking ingredients. There is only one problem  - the times given to prepare the meals are generally wildly optimistic, ie where the author states 40 min preparation time, you will need A LOT MORE, but then cooking Iranian food the Iranian way (my partner makes 5 different dishes when we have one couple over.........) is time consuming and not for the hurried, ie tie your apron and prepare to relax in the kitchen",1

"This book seems, to me, an excellent expanded followup to the concepts intitially presented in Wilsons' Prometheus Rising. In tandem, the two books really do help one to gain knowledge of the brain software that interprets the information that forms our varying tunnels of reality. The personal gains one percieves from the knowledge presented in these books will be just that, very personal, depending on ones' experience. So further explanations of the fruits contained within this work and its predecessor will be fairly useless. That being said, I highly recommend this book for the potential fruits one could reap. As for the review from Mike the Physicist from CA. Haha..hehe..A perfect example of the narrowness of perception about which Wilson teaches. Apparently, being a &quot;professional physicist&quot; could not evaluate the content on anything else but the presentation of the physics concepts. However, this is not a physics book. It is a psychology/philosophy book with proofs that reach into concepts of modern physics. And in this regard, the book succeeds perfectly. I have read the works of Neils Bohr(a physicist and primary reference for Wilson) as well as many of the books that &quot;mike from CA&quot; has referenced. And no where does Wilson falter in his presentation of the concepts. Nor does the book venture into concepts beyond the grasp of the laymen, thus succeeding in its mission. However, maybe failing for Mike who needed a dissertation to satisfy his professionally induced ego. geez.",1

"Original review of 1st Edition, November 9, 2005This is the Galápagos guide you want!Andy Swash (photographer) and Rob Still (computer design wizard) have conspired to produce the handiest and most authoritative guide to the wildlife of these enchanted islands. They have pioneered the use of computer enhanced photographs, which combine the advantage of a photograph as an accurate record of an individual, with the artists ability to stress those features that are representative of the species. In one pocket-sized, 168 page, full-colour photographic guide you have all you need to identify almost all of the archipelago's wildlife including every living species of bird, mammal and reptile. And since WILDGuides are a non-profit organisation which supports conservation throughout the world, you are helping ensure that the wildlife you enjoy today will still be there for others to enjoy tomorrow. Check out their other titles, all of which share the enhanced photography approach.The prefect guide for the curious visitor and expert alike. Look no further!----------------Comments on 2nd Edition, September 5, 2006This second edition (white cover) differs from the first (blue cover - see review above) as follows:-* it includes new species for the islands, such as Green Heron and Grey-headed Gull* all range maps have been revised and updated* the cetaceans section has been completely revamped * a new section on ""electronic media"" is provided* the species checklist has been brought right up-to-dateThe guide remains the top recommendation for wildlife observation on the islands and WILDGuides are still a non-profit organisation with an impressive record of donations to conservation.",1

"     In Walter Dean Myers' book, ""Monster,"" Steve Harmon, age 16, is in prison awaiting trial for murder, accused of serving as a lookout during a robbery in which the robbers shot and killed a drugstore owner.  While in prison, Steve, a film student, tells about his life, his case, and his imprisonment in the form of a movie screenplay interspersed with diary entries in which he describes his feelings, his life before the murder, and the frightening conditions in prison.  Is Steve a ""monster"" responsible for the senseless death of the storeowner, as the prosecutor alleges, or is he guilty only of knowing the crime participants?                	Weaving handwriting-typeface journal entries, grainy cinematic quality photographs, and fast-paced movie script dialogue with directions for camera angles, Myers has written a unique novel.  As a young adult who finds himself in a violent place in the adult world, Steve is a compelling character.  Faced with what may be a permanent loss of independence, and taking a hard look at his identity and at his integrity, Steve attempts to convince himself that he is not the ""monster"" the prosecutor alleges.  Readers serve as witnesses to the courtroom proceedings, but find themselves serving as jurors as well.  When reading the story, it is virtually impossible to remain unmoved - we make a decision about this young man's guilt or innocence, and we are anxious to see if the jury in the book reaches the same conclusion.                                    	                      Myers presents questions about Steve, about our justice system, and about the nature of guilt and innocence.  He gives readers no easy answers.  ""Monster"" is a riveting novel that makes readers think - while reading and after reading the book.

"If you're reading this review, you have access to the internet and don't need this book. About 99% of the information in this book can be found on the internet.

And if you're a contributor to Tarantino forums, chances are Holm ripped off some of your observations and is trying to sell them back to you.I was really looking forward to this book and bought it the first day it was released.

"I had picked this book up and put it back down several times when I saw it at the book store. I am glad I finally bought it! It is an interesting idea, and one that I am sure many of us can identify with:  a memoir built on memories of certain beloved items of clothing.  Ilene Beckerman had an interesting childhood and has had a varied life as an adult.  Obviously, her talents lie more in writing than in drawing--the sketches of the clothing are rather simple,but she does manage to convey what she felt like wearing each outfit.  It doesn't take very long to read, and if read in one sitting you get quite a sense of her life.  Sometimes funny, sometimes quite bittersweet, but always entertaining",1
"""Fatal Justice"" concerns the so -called Green Beret Murders, which occurred at Fort Bragg, NC in February, 1970.  A young Green Beret Captain, Jeffrey MacDonald was eventually convicted of killing his wife and two infant daughters. There were several doubts about the Government's case: Among them was mishandled evidence the night of the murder, a hostile trial judge, the accused's selection of a presumptively inappropriate defense attorney and the refusal of the court to entertain exculpatory evidence. Furthermore, there had been an extraordinary delay in brining MacDonald to trial. The Fort Bragg Provost Marshall had refused to recommend a court-martial. Since the proceeding rendering that decision was labeled a ""criminal investigation"" and not a ""judicial proceeding"", CaptainMacDonald was eligible to be charged in a civil court free of double jeopardy. His appeal based on lack of a speedy trial was denied. MacDonald received three life terms in Federal Prison and there he sits to this day. In the early 1980s, the popular novel ""Fatal Vision"" told the MacDonald story to the country. It raised considerable doubt about the quality of the conviction. Yet this reviewer believed, as did many Americans, that justice had likely, if not definitively, been achieved. A TV movie with Karl Malden and Eva Marie Saint solidified that sentiment.  Fatal Justice turns the entire MacDonald affair upside down: FJ is the most disturbing true crime report this reviewer has read. It was hard for this reviewer to remain calm! FJ denotes in great and painful detail how MacDonald was railroaded to the jailhouse by a lying, duplicitous, dishonest prosecution that first decided on his guilt and then made the evidence fit their case. There was wholesale direct or indirect suppression of evidence. Other witnesses who could have cleared the Captain were not allowed to testify-including one man who admitted to the murders! Disclosures from the ubiquitous Helena Stoeckley would have blown the case open! The Captain's original claim that drug crazed intruders committed the act, which seemed so far fetched at trial, now appears exculpatory. A strong defense could have raised so much reasonable doubt with a fair- minded jury!  Yet after years of research by the authors, not to mention teams of MacDonald lawyers, the courts have ruled that it is too late to introduce new evidence! MacDonald's attorneys should have exercised due diligence and discovered the surpressed evidence back in the 1970s! How does one discover evidence that, for all practical purposes is surpressed?  It is safe to assume that those interested in the case have read FV. These folks owe it to themselves to also read FJ! Everyone is entitles to their own opinion but this reviewer questions how anybody who contemplates FV and FJ can fail to agree that MacDonald is innocent. The expectation of a fair trail, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, the concept of reasonable doubt in determining innocence, the guarantee of speedy trial, the convicted's due of a just and impartial appeal, redress against prosecutorial misconduct, the right to have exculpatory factors admitted as evidence are all outrightly assaulted by the MacDonald murder case. Any of the amazon community can suffer from an over-zealous prosecution someday. FJ is deeply serious food for thought, regardless of one's opinion on the specifics of the Green Beret Murder Case. Critics may carp that FJ is sometimes repetitive.  The view here is that the authors are good lawyers  driving home their points. Messrs. Potter and Bost should be commended for their dogged research and pursuit of the truth.",1

" I love travel books.  I have loved them with a perfectly idiotic passion ever since I was a kid in Seldovia and read The Royal Road to Romance by Richard Halliburton and with him climbed the Matterhorn and worked on a tramp steamer through the Suez Canal and battled cobras in India and was boarded by pirates in the South China Sea.  After that I was incapable of walking out to Linder's Beach and looking at the way Cook Inlet fell off into the Gulf of Alaska without wondering where else I could get to if I set sail for the horizon.Richard Halliburton taught me that the best travel books are written by someone you wish had waited for you to come with.  An Englishman of Irish descent, Pete McCarthy descends upon the island of Ireland with Rules of Travel, such as the eighth rule, Never Pass a Bar That Has Your Name On It.  He never does, and in between never passing those bars among other things he climbs Croagh Patrick and goes on a medival purgatory, I think mostly so we don't have to.

"I am quite shocked by all of the poor reviews below. This text is actually very good, in that it address several topics that Grinold and Kahn do not, mainly utility theory (and its role in investor decision making), the international CAPM, and the Black-Litterman model. First, the presentation of the investment decision making process by Litterman from an economics (utility maximization) view point is right on target. Too often portfolio theory is simply presented in a pure mathematical finance format that, while teaching the mechanics, leaves the end user incapable of understanding the implications of the analysis they are performing. Additionally, Litterman's presentation of the international CAPM and universal hedge models are very well done and extremely important.  Finally, the Black-Litterman model has become mainstream (it is incorporated into the Ibbotson software) and is completely ignored by Grinold!I own both Litterman and Grinold, and if you can afford both I would buy both because Grinold does a nice job simply presenting the mathematics, but then so do so many other texts.

"From bike crashes, to growing up, to inspirational stories; this book has it all. Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul Three will bring a tear to your eye and put a smile on your face. It was organized by three adults. Kimberly Kirberger, Mark Hansen, and Jack Canfield.  But the book itself was written purely by teens.  This edition of Chicken Soup is not the first. There are many others, including one for pet lovers! This book will really make you want to get up and do something. When reading these stories, I felt inspired to change something that I thought was wrong.  I especially enjoyed that you don't have to read the book in order. You can pick the story that fits your mood, and from the first sentence you're captured. These stories are all non-fiction. Some are funny and some are sad, but each is special. If there's one you don't like, skip it!One of the stories that I enjoyed was called ""Some Things Are Never the Same."" It's about two friends who are growing apart because of cliques. The popular friend falls into a trap. Her new ""so called friends"" make up rumors about her old friend. In the end, although the girl realizes her mistake, the friendship isn't the same. I can really relate to this because dealing with friendships can be hard.  The teens who submit to this book really have a story to tell. I think it's cool that they're true stories, because you can imagine being in their shoes.  I really loved the book because it kept me reading for hours. The book also contains stories from famous actors, athletes, and singers. There is even a passage from The Diary of Anne Frank! Whenever I need a boost, I reach for the book and read the stories again. ",1

"Granted this book is pretty thin (140 pages) and there are much better treatments out there.  Even so, any book that correctly points out we are in the midst of a massive unsustainable housing/credit bubble deserves more than 1 star. I'm giving this 5 stars just to counter-balance the clueless Realt-whore troll's comments above.  And by the way, the banks (and mortgage lenders, Realtors, appraisers, etc.) DO make money re-selling homes in down markets as well as in bull markets.  One of the biggest reaons why we're experiencing a housing bubble right now is because the MBS (Mortgage-Backed Securities) & CMO (Collateralized Mortgage Obligations) markets have removed virtually ALL RISK for the mortgage lenders.  Banks today are little more than loan ORIGINATORS, who sell off the loans to Fannie MAe, Freddie Mac or a private REIT, who in turn bundle them into MBS/CMO paper.  These get sold off to institutional investors (mutual funds, FCBs, etc.), who in many cases are unaware of the risk these securities represent.If you're a bank and basically carry NONE of the risk of default for any of the loans you issue, why WOULDN'T you make as many risky loans as possible to anyone with a pulse?  You get your fees and then you pass off the loan to some sucker's 401k plan. We're going to be experiencing the nasty consequences of this scenario very soon, as this bubble unwinds",1

"Programming Pearls is one of the very few books that looks at the problems that we as programmers all have, and keep on having day in and day out. It strives for solutions to problems that are compact, efficient and fast. It questions thinking and makes you think about programming.

This is one of my favorite programming books, as I always find something 'new' just by browsing it. Unlike some other books on similar topics, the delivery of the information is concise and pallatable. I love this book",1

"These ""tell all"" books about Jehovah's Witnesses are absurd.  As one of Jehovah's Witnesses I sometimes meet people we have read and believe this trash.  It is always the same.  The information about the structure of our organization is more or less accurate, but the way it works is completely misrepresented.The matter of blood transfusions is an example.  The Jehovah's Witnesses I know sincerly disapprove of blood transfusions and view attempts to force a (to them) morally repugnant therapy on them as a violation of their human rights.If Mr. Reed really claims that 9000 Jehovah's Witnesses a year die as a result of refusing blood transfusions, then he is a fool.  They have been receiving excellent and highly effective care, including major surgery and treatment in cases of acute blood loss, for decades now.  We are now seeing methods first used to treat Jehovah's Witnesses being hailed as the ""gold standard"" for the treatment of all patients.Articles in medical journals are a much more balanced source of information than books by disgruntled former members.  (...)  One excerpt:Of the 498 patients the centre [at Our Lady of Resurrection Medical Center in Chicago] admitted in 1 year, 5 died. Indeed, mortality rates at a few other centres appear to be remarkably low. Dr. David Rosencrantz, a urologist who runs a large bloodless program in Portland, Oregon, told Justice Horace Krever in December that his centre hasn't lost a patient even though it has treated 500 to 700 patients annually since it was founded 4 years ago. ""From a cost standpoint . . . our patients are out a full day earlier,"" Rosencrantz said",1

"My sister gave me a copy of this book for my birthday last year and I made a point of reading a section each night for the next two months. By the end of that time period, I had reminded myself of the importance of reintroducing all kinds of &quot;pamper myself&quot; rituals into my life, like having decadent bath products on hand so that I can indulge in a soothing end-of-day bubble bath or simply treating myself to a cup of my favorite herbal tea if I'm feeling especially frazzled after a rough day at work.

I pick it up to read it frequently, usually just a story or two, maybe a koan to puzzle over (still baffle me, these many years later).

The crank handle is the smallest I've seen and feels like it will break easily.  3. The worst feature is the on/off switch for the flashlight. It is a ""push"" round button mounted on the side that keeps turning itself on when you hold the radio or pick it up.  They should have used a ""slide"" switch and put it in a different area",0

So, saying that ""Anyone looking to solve the mystery of Adam Sandler's mass appeal is not going to do it here"" seems to be a ridiculous statement.The movie is funny from ""all angles"".  The story is good, the cast is as solid as I've ever seen in a comedy, etc, etc... Whether or not you're usually into Sandler's brand of comedy, you will most likely appreciate this film. I feel that this is Adam Sandler at his best - and it is certainly one of his most successful projects.Highly recommended",0

I would recommend it to any history buff, Tolkien fan,  fantasy reader, or just any one looking for a well written story",1
"Based upon a foreign film that translates into English as OPEN YOUR EYES (ABRE LOS OJOS), VANILLA SKY gets its title from a Claude Monet painting, ""Seine at Argenteuil"" that the film's protagonist, David Aames (Tom Cruise) has upon a wall.  The painting is sometimes mistakenly referred to as ""Vanilla Sky"" because of the color that Monet used for the sky in the painting.  The misnomer of the painting's title is a key in understanding and appreciating the film because early on it becomes clear that this is a movie that likes to play with one's mind and the things that take place aren't necessarily real.VANILLA SKY revolves around the character of David Aames.  David is the son and heir of a international media tycoon.  Most everyone close to him, including his best friend Brain Shelby (Jason Lee) see David as a spoiled brat who has no appreciation whatsoever for all the gifts that have been given to him since birth.  He takes advantage of almost everyone he meets and lives in a fantasy world of wine, women, and song.  At the start of the film David is involved in a serious relationship with a beautiful blonde named Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz).  They have been dating for sometime and are romantically linked, but David doesn't feel their relationship is as serious as Julie does.  Whereas Julie is waiting for David to commit and propose, David sees her as simply being a ""friend with benefits.""At his birthday party, David meets a woman that he finds so captivating and fascinating that he falls immediately in love with her.  The woman, Sophia Serrano (Penelope Cruz) is the opposite of everything that he found attractive in Julie.  David ends up walking her back to her place and spends the night talking with her.  To him, Sophia is the woman of his dreams.  She is the woman he would choose to marry.  Unfortunately for David, Julie doesn't take things very well.  She reminds him of some of the unavoidable truths about their relationship.  Julie and David are involved in a car crash and when he opens his eyes, he is living in a different world.His face has been reconstructed and at first things seem normal.  But then David starts having nightmares.  Soon the nightmares of his dreams seem to mix with his day to day life.  He finds himself unable to distinguish the difference.  Sophia is Julie and Julie is Sophia.  The world is too confusing and David longs to sleep so that he can return to his dreams.  Pleasant, pleasant dreams filled with the Sophia he met at the party and skies colored in vanilla.I really don't like Tom Cruise much.  He does have talent, but his large ego and cocky attitude take away from every picture I've ever seen him act in.  Therefore, I was reluctant to see VANILLA SKY.  I wish I would have watched the movie long ago.The movie is a strange romantic drama sci-fi picture that tackles some huge issues.  How do we live our lives?  Would you rather live your life in a comfortable existence filled with superficial happiness or would you rather live an exciting, though often painful life filled with wonder and awe, truth and beauty, but only occasional moments of happiness?  This is a decision that each one of us is actually presented with daily. We might not always recognize it as such, but it is and the way that choice is presented in the film makes VANILLA SKY such a powerful and engaging piece of cinema.Cruise's ego works well for most of the film, though it denies the audience from completely identifying and empathizing with the plight of David Aames.  Cruise is a great jerk, but not a very good reformed man.  However, his gift at playing spoiled id-driven men sucks the audience into the action of VANILLA SKY from the beginning and even though one is never convinced of David's reformation, Cruise's performance/presence keeps the audience engaged throughout the film.  Penelope Cruz reminds me of a Spanish Audrey Hepburn and though she isn't in the movie a great deal, she shines in the moments that she is.  Cameron Diaz is a beauty and movie star, but overcomes her celebrity. She does a wonderful job of portraying Julie, an everywoman character that many women who have been stepped upon by men can relate to.  Julie isn't on screen very long either, but when she is she raises some important questions about love, relationships, and sex in American society.  Another important actor in the film is Jason Lee.  Lee portrays David's best friend Brian, who is busy writing a novel.  Brian is the catalyst for many of the film's deeper thought-provoking moments.  It is also Brian who just might hold the key to the real meaning of the film.  Like Cruise, sometimes having Lee in a picture is a turnoff, however in VANILLA SKY he is perfectly cast.VANILLA SKY isn't the easiest film to understand.  It isn't necessarily the most romantic film and though it's an intelligent movie, it asks more questions than it answers.  It also has an open ending, so people who have to have a movie end all tidy will have problems with the film's ending.  Nevertheless, the film is a beautiful piece of cinema that engages and entertains.  A person cannot watch it without and not have something to think about later.  That's something only really good movies can do",0

"       Hi people. Metamorpho has had a busy day - reflecting mostly. Anyway children - before all this technology hit and digital sound bytes infiltrated everyone's craniums- we actually had some purity to the music. If you've been following my reviews - when we last left Metamorpho - someone gave him a free ticket to see Simon and Garfunkel at Carnegie Hall.  Essentially this program was pretty much the same- as presented here as being at Philharmonic Hall. But who can quibble? I do remember distinctly coming away with amazement that they could be so mesmerizing by utilizing only vocals and one guitar.  And the audience REALLY listened to them! And it was all real!     These tunes are essentially from the beginning of their career.  It is amazing how good Paul is on guitar and practically makes you forget the embellishments that were added in the studio. You have the angelic voice of Art Garfunkel perfectly juxtaposed against Paul's vocals.  The enunciation, the precision, the timing of the harmonies is about as perfect as you can get.  One can see easily the effect that The Everly Brothers had on them.  This live recording is a pure joy.  It reminds us that - at one time - we didn't have the need for alot of musicians when the material was this good. Dylan also was able to weave his magic this way. But, everybody plugged in electric guitars and things became different. Mind you, Metamorpho is fine with all this because it is transition and progress - but isn't it good to hear this nugget, that preserves a moment in time which will always be precious?      You can see what songs they do under the song select on this page.  What I will say is that they are sung expertly and you will be stung by the sheer beauty of the balanced harmonies. It is good to have them both - forever preserved in their prime. Believe me people, if Metamorpho had been given more tickets back then, I would have gladly brought you along. But, since that didn't happen, just imagine yourselves sneaking into New York City with me to see this. Close your eyes, put on this c.d., and you are there! You see them, don't you? Artie and Paul on stage with just a chairstool, microphones and a guitar. Metamorpho is proud of your efforts to tune in to the collective unconcious! Alright Alright. Enough babbling from Metamorpho. But, when I say it's a treasure .... it's a TREASURE! I wouldn't steer you wrong or get you to drink tainted Kool-Aid. Trust me................ Metamorpho ",0

These two books has been misleading lots of astral projection learner.If you want to get a book to see what are the mistake concept that Robert Bruce has, then get this book.But any people with basic astral projection skill will know, that is Robert Bruce's more of mind-imaginary skills.Many people has natural ability to astral project, all you need is the right pointers.

"Graham and Marvin change the way we look at the city.  Borrowing from architecture, geography, urban planning and sociology they demonstrate how infrastructure, mobility and urban life are intertwined in messy, fragmented configurations.  Splintering Urbanism illustrates the increasingly segregated city, describing the unequal access to infrastructures of energy, information and transport - where providing corporations `cherry pick' the most potentially profitable users.

Less blazing guitar than he showcased on Tiny Town's only CD, but his role in that band was more lead guitarist than frontman/singer. His trademark slide guitar is back, too. This guy deserves to be a major star. He has had lously luck with his other bands and prior record labels. Spread the word",0
"I have grown very fond of Cheryl Bentyne. Her voice is so malleable. It can be sharp, high, smoky, playful and quite clear. Her previous CD's are all very very nice, as is this one.This appears to be her second themed CD, the first being 'Moonlight Serenade'. With guest vocalists John Pizzarelli and Mark Kibble & Alvin Chea of Take 6 fame, she has offered a timeline of the stages of love.The song choices are very well thought out for the theme and follow well. Starting with 'You Don't Know Me' and finishing with 'Goodbye' and a reprise of 'Book of Love'. This version of 'The Book of Love' is not the doo-wop version. It is a very romantic version written in 1999... very nice fit to this theme.After 'You Don't Know Me' comes 'Be My Love', both sung in a soft, enchanting manner with great orchestration in the back. 'Blue Moon' is next with John Pizzarelli joining in. Nicely done, slow, romantic version.Then comes 'Let's Do It', and old Louis Armstrong song that is difficult to make interesting at times. She takes it nice and languid, using her voice to give variety within the music. Nicest version of this song I've heard yet.'Don't Say A Word' follows... slow, romantic with emphasis on piano in the background. Then 'The Book of Love' with some great, standout vocals from part of 'Take6' harmonizing nicely with Cheryl's voice.The tracks that follow, 'You Taught My Heart To Sing', 'You Go To My Head', 'Cry Me a River', 'I'm a fool to Want You', 'Goodbye' and 'The Book of Love/Reprise' and all well done. The tempo is easy, soft and mournful at times.This is a great, romantic CD to put in for those moments of reflection or meditation. No bounce or upbeat here, but certainly not boring in the least.Cheryl Bentyne is making her own way as a great vocalist sans The Manhattan Transfer and I certainly hope she continues her voyage",0

The music is soothing, the narrations are warm, the pacing is slow - everything is designed to hold your toddler's attention while quietly lulling them into a peaceful, sleepy state.The DVD includes 7 short stories that last from 4.5 ~ 9 minutes each, with the average around 6.5 min.  One nice feature is that, in addition to picking individual stories, you can also select ""Play All"" from the menu and they will all run in succession.  From start to finish, it lasts about 45 minutes, but don't let its brevity keep you from purchasing it.  Honestly, what price can you put on a stress-free transition to bedtime?  And isn't this the kind of video where the object really is to put the viewer to sleep before the end?Each story is heart-warming, sometimes with a simple lesson and sometimes just simply snooze-inducing.  We got this when our oldest child was just a 18 months and he was captivated by the characters in ""Happy Birthday Moon"", ""Goodnight Gorilla"", and ""The Hat"" from the very start.  He would often request a bedtime video by name (sometimes as a delaying tactic) and it always relaxed him.  As he's grown from toddler to pre-schooler, he connected more with the children in ""How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight"" and recognized the humor in ""The Napping House"".This is a great way for the entire family to wind-down before putting your child(ren) to bed.  In a market flooded with commercialized programming for kids, this is a stand-out in the crowd.  A great tool for parents, a quiet bonding time for families, and a comforting way for little ones to close their eyes and drift away into dreamland",0

"The Knowing Heart draws a sweeping picture of the Sufi way, covering such topics as the structure of the spiritual path, the centrality of love, Sufi psychology, the importance of spiritual friendship and community, spiritual  faculties, and the sources of the Sufi tradition. Clearly the fruit of  personal, heartfelt experience, Helminski's work is a refreshing addition  to a body of literature that all too often neglects the profound role that  tradition plays in Sufism. He accomplishes this task without subverting  either tradition or the needs of his audience. In marked contrast to the  &quot;pick-and-choose&quot; spirituality that seems so popular nowadays,  The Knowing Heart speaks from the heart, yet a heart humbled and submissive  to the sources which enliven it",1
"This book is a very good book to read because it goes into excellent detail about the major events that occurred during Bob's life.  The book starts off by grabbing your attention and never let's go.  The book explains who Bob is and what he believes in as he becomes a Rasta.  The book is good because it explains why and how Bob even got started on singing and playing music.  The book also tells about Bob Marley's life before he became a reggae poet.  It says how life was when he was little living in Trench Town with the other thugs that lived around there too.  The author organized and put the book together very nicely.  His text was not hard to follow but he could have done better on the time line of the book.  I didn't like that the book was very wordy and the author dragged on things that he shouldn't have, like, how the British started to get interested in Bob.  Things like that are good to know but he shouldn't have talked so much about them.  Overall Catch a Fire is a great piece of literature and I would give it five stars.	",1
"I had to use this for a class and boy was I dissapointed.  This book relies more on words than examples.  Each sentance feels like a mouthful, packed with words that each refer to a concept in programming.  Subsequently, you either have to read extremely slow, or read the paragraph over and over before you understand what the author is trying to say.  Extremely unclear and frustrating.  Avoid this book",1
"One thing that some &quot;certified professionals&quot; lack these days is an understanding of cabling... they call that wire a backbone for a reason, you know.

My 8 yr old daughter received this CD for Christmas. She has all the Bratz CD's & loves them! We also are getting the Bratz DVD's. This music is good for those girls that are in between little girl songs & real tween songs. It's a good transition type of music. The Bratz also show diversity & deliver a message to kids on their level. I would recommend this music for girls at 7yrs+.,0

"Although it is obvoius that to squeeze 7 centuries of history of Europe and Asia Minor into 1 volume (although very thick) is a task for an ingenious historian, to make this volume engrossing and even fascinating -  is hardly achievable. But Mr. Durant's talent is unsurpassed: the book  contains summary of all important events - military and religeous, cultural  and social - as well as biographies of legendary personae of the times we  used to call the Dark Ages. But the language of the book and the details it  provides are not just dry facts (which makes many other similar  compilations boring and easily forgettable), the author makes you feel and  understand the customs and rites of the epoch, its way of dressing, food,  family relations..., by drawing parallels with our times.  I have read  quite a few books on history of that period, and by far, this book,  employing a special scientific approach, is the best, although written  several decades ago: it throbbs with the echo of life of centuries long  past",1
"Here we have the seventh edition of my favourite ongoing series. This volume we see a return of characters we haven't seen in quite some time. The first story arch in this volume is a four-part tale set in a prison where we catch up on loop, who we haven't seen since volume 3. In the second arch is the return of the drug junkie jack daw. This is a great volume from the creators of the 100 bullets saga. Get it today",1
"It may be that you've got to be at least 50 years old to appreciate this book fully.  Why?  Because Cousy reflects on a game that doesn't exist anymore.  It was a time when people did not take three steps to the basket, when palming the ball was a turnover, and when good sportsmanship was the standard.  It was also a time, and this is what is so hard to believe, when a guy like Cousy, who came along just in time to save the financially failing NBA, worried each and every year about making the team.  It was a time when a hard nosed Red Auerbach, who didn't even want Cousy because he thought him a showoff, coupled Cousy's playmaking with Russell's defense to make a team, the only team in fact, that dominated its sport as the Yankees did in baseball.  Cousy was Auerbach's first big hitter, and despite his success as a player, coach and university president, Cousy remains humble, reflective, and self effacing.  Cousy is a we guy, not an I guy.  Refreshing. ",1
"I give this book a very high recommendation and think anyone who reads it will love it as much as I did.  I have read a few biographys on L. M. Montgomery but reading her own thoughts, in her own words was even more interesting and insightful.  I am looking forward to reading the next journal",1

"Dean Cain stars as the marshall of  an underwater mining facility. He arrests some maniac Russian  who later gets out of prison and comes back to get Cain. There's another plot about people on the facility committing suicide but none of it really matters. If the plot sounds thin to base an entire movie on, you're right. There was no reason for this movie to be made, it's basically an ultra low budget rip off of Outland. Since it will cost the you the same at your video store, rent Outland",0
"     Goldsmith has been painting his watercolors since he graduated from Yale in the 1930s after studying under the noted watercolorist Eliot O'Hara. His travels to the Caribbean, Central America, and Southeast Asia after graduation infused his characteristic paintings done mostly in Maine and Vermont with a use of color both deft and delicate and an almost calligraphic sense of line and organization. Carl Little's title ""Passion of Place"" for his Introduction refers especially to Goldsmith's use of color. As Little notes, Goldsmith's paintings are essentially evocative rather than representational even though scenes are recognizable in them. Drawn early in his career to Turner's watercolor sketches, Goldsmith himself allows this. Winslow Homer and Andrew Wyeth are other detectable, but indirect influences. All but a few of the 62 full-page, full-color plates were done after 1990, Goldsmith's mature period when his distinctive, absorbing style was fully developed.",1

"I was a bit skeptical on buying this album due to the rewiews it was given on Amazon. I bought Mafia because I really liked Fire It Up, while not expecting too much. I loved Ozzy era Zakk Wylde, so I figured I would get it so I could enjoy some healthy guitar playing. I was surprised at the quality metal that Zakk was laying down and Mafia got me interested in BLS. The next album on the list was this album but even though I wanted to get it, I was hesitant because of the beat down it was recieving by these reviewers. I think that the album is great, and I think the first 5 or 6 tracks on the album made the money I spent worth it. If you are a fan of BLS I recommend getting this album. So far any investment I have made in BLS has come up worth it and this album was no let down",0
"At Coaching Toward Happiness and at MentorCoach, we write about the leading figures in positive psychology and in coaching and talk to them in live teleconference interviews.  We interviewed Chris three times.  His new book is exceptional.  Here's why:  ===================1.  It's The Best. ===================Okay.  This is arguably the best introduction to positive psychology ever written.  It ties all the key issues together in a compelling way.  It provides understanding, depth, rich resources, and it's fun to read.  =========================2.  It's Reader-Friendly.  =========================It's a large trade paperback, 314 pages.  Rich with fascinating detail, web sites, movies, overarching explanations of research.Bad writing makes the reader feel dumb.  Good writing makes the reader feel smart.  Chris makes you feel smart.===================3.  If You Teach.  ===================If you teach positive psychology, you have to use this book.  Listen to the founder of the field:  ""This is the definitive textbook in positive psychology.  But more than that, it may be the single best textbook on any subject that I have ever read... (It) both made me laugh out loud and brought tears to my eyes."" -- Martin E. P. Seligman======================================4.  For the Bright Professional======================================It's perfect for the curious, bright professional who's new to positive psychology and wants to quickly get up to speed.  If you understand The Primer, you'll be ahead of 99% of the people in your field.==========================5.  It Sounds Like Chris.  ==========================Conversational and accessible.  It reads like he talks.  And it reads like a conversation with someone who's twice won the honor of best teacher at the University of Michigan.======================================6.  It Has Tiny Throw-Away Nuggets.======================================  The words ""positive psychology"" were first used, not by Seligman in 1998, but Maslow in 1954.  ""...The smiley-face icon was created for a life insurance company in 1964 by a Massachusetts graphic artist, who was paid $45 for his creation.  Neither the insurance company nor artist Harvey Bell copyrighted the symbol which has--perhaps as a result--become extremely popular.""===================7.  The Songs.  ===================Each chapter ends with films and dozens of Chris' favorite, relevant songs:  ""Be True to Your School"" (Beach Boys); ""Get Up, Stand Up"" (Bob Marley & the Wailers), ""To Sir, With Love"" (LuLu); ""I Feel Good"" (James Brown); ""My Sweet Lord"" (George Harrison).  Walking on Sunshine"" (Katrina & the Waves).  He admits to being a baby boomer and knows it shows in his song choice.  He also believes a relevant song is a great way to signal the beginning of a class.=========================8.  Personal Usefulness.  =========================You might even find it personally useful.  Of the thousands of suggestions for increasing happiness that have been proffered in the last fifty years, indeed over the centuries, which have so far been empirically examined?  It goes beyond the headlines and looks in detail at what the research might really mean for what you do.  =======================9.  It's Unpretentious.=======================In 2003, I sometimes taught a teleclass from Chris' office at Penn.  His entire office consisted of a computer, a bare floor, one table and chair, and a bookshelf with 15 scattered books.  Nothing to indicate, for example, that he was among the world's 100 most frequently cited psychologists during the past 20 years.  The Primer is similarly down to earth.  Name one other famous academic who would write this paragraph:  ""...some skeptics still believe that positive psychologists miss the ""obvious"" point that life is tragic...  I disagree but will not belabor the point except to note that tragedy admits to gradations.  Even if everything sucks, some things suck more than others, an irrefutable fact given how people actually behave if not what they say....Whether we label ...preferred circumstances ""positive"" or ""less sucky"" then becomes a matter of semantics (P. 13).""======================================10.  Find the Tenth Reason Yourself.======================================Chris was the lead creator of the VIA Survey of Signature Strengths,a central positive psychology assessment.  More than 300,000 people from throughout the world have taken it.  Who better to write about theimportance of individual strengths and values than the world's leadingexpert?  This is just one part of this book.  You'll be able to findmany more than the ""tenth"" reason when you read him.  And, even better, if you'd also like to *listen* to him talk about his work, you can.  There are three free online interviews--two also available by telephone--in the archive of the Coaching Toward Happiness eNewsletter.  Amazon's ground rules preclude my tellingyou the url but if you google [""Coaching Toward Happiness"" + Chris Peterson], you'll find them.  ",1

"Just got it today from amazon, very nice watch very sharp looking. Black dial makes the look of it. I have simular watch with silver/while dial from Missimo. I needed another one to go with my black suites and to wear to work, that is not bulky or heavy. Overall very pleased with the purchase. One thing though, it was very important that bracelet is a Fold Over Clasp type. You can not tell from the photo and pulsar's website does not mention the bracelet type either, but it is. So for those who want nice watch with Fold Over Clasp bracelet and does not want to spend a lot i would definitely recomend checking this out. Hope this helps",0
Just like this book is a complete waste of time to those who can't read a C++ book.

"	On Goth girl, Ravens, 16th birthday, she sees a moving truck at an old abandoned mansion.  On Halloween night, Raven and her best friend Becky go trick-or-treating; the last stop is to go to the old abandoned Mansion.  Raven goes up to the door, but Becky goes home, Raven gives the butler a snickers bar and a plastic spider ring.  Trevor, Ravens enemy, comes to get some candy, but Raven said that they have no more candy left so Trevor tries to spray paint the mansion but Raven hit Trevor's hand with a tennis racket, Raven broke his hand.  Raven starts to go to work at the Armstrong travel agency to pay her dad back for the racket that she lost, to Raven the Armstrong Travel agency is like prison. Raven sneaks into the mansion when the butler is out shopping; she starts in the basement and finds Mirrors, and a drawing of Dracula and boxes with the word Soil, and Alexander's watercolors on them.  She goes upstairs and sees someone that she has seen before she runs downstairs into the basement and leaves the mansion. She Sprints out so fast that she is as fast as a Cheetah.  I like this series of books by Ellen Scheiber because it is spooky, weird, and funny all at the same time.  There are three books after this one Vampire Kisses 2, Vampire Kisses 3, and Vampire Kisses.  To me the Genre is gothic fiction",1

"Lee is an edgy artistic Cinderella presented in a series of images portraying various facets of her sensory existence. Like a visually satisfying movie, her life plays out in contrasts with pure moonlit swims in seas of memory. By page one I had laughed and cried. By page seven I loved Lee in all her vulnerability, so innocent at heart, yet so famililar with the urban life. Jardine Libaire's descriptive writing shows striking powers of observation beyond the normal recognition of life's complexity. Vertical pieces of thought paint in slivers as the story evolves like a montage of memories. The vibrancy of the portrait forming is cast in shades of lighting only an artist's sensibility could master.  ""Then he'd gotten the makings of Mexican hot chocolate at a deli. He managed to use three pots, a couple knives, and a few spoons. Left chocolate shavings on the counter, cinnamon and burned milk on the stove. The sun had vanished, and he cooked in the dark. The only light was the violet blossom of gas flame."" ~pg. 167Stream-of-consciousness writing unravels Lee in her beauty and rite of passage through emotional complexity. She is loveable and running from herself into pleasures. Lost in sensuality and moments, she evolves and awakens, captured in silky prose. Memories of Lee's mother are nostalgic in beauty and contrast with the life Lee throws herself into with abandon.Jardine Libaire's seductive writing style slips you into a calm solitude where splashes of images layer the story's canvas. ~The Rebecca Review ",1
"FRANK'S WILD YEARS (title taken from a SWORDFISHTROMBONES tune) is a record of sound.  No kiddin' Sherlock, you say; it's a music record.  Please note, I didn't say it was a record of ""music.""  I mean, yes, this is a musical record--but the emphasis, as with it's two predecessors SWORDFISHTROMBONES and RAIN DOGS, it upon sonic diversity.I guess WILD YEARS is a polka record.  It does tell the story of a young accordian player from the butt-end of nowhere (""Rainville.  Hardly ever did, though.  Rain, that is.  It was nowhere."") bent on making the big time (""I'm goin' straight up to the top, oh yeah, up where the air is fresh and clean"").   He hits a lot of potholes along the way (""It's more than rain that falls on our parade tonight""), eventually crashing and burning (""It was a train that took me away from here/But a train can't bring me home"").  And we are just listeners along for the ride, reveling in Waits's ever-expanding experimentation with what all he can do with a few instruments, some lyrics, and his haunting, gravelly voice",0
"I loved this book! It was interesting and original. I think it was realistic too. I even think of Chrissa and the other characters as real people.

This is one of my favorite books ever, and I hope Phyllis Reynolds Naylor writes a sequal to it",1

"If you like 80's metal then this is worth having.  These 10 tracks are some of the best.  There are no fillers.  This is the first of three volumes, but I think this is the best one of the three.  Unlike the other two volumes in this series, this one contains ZERO metal ballads.  Here are the tracks:  Bang Your Head (Metal Health) - Quiet Riot: That's what this is all about.  We're Not Gonna Take It - Twisted Sister: Of course we're not; this was the anthem of a generationNothin' But A Good Time - Poison: That's what the 80's were all about.Round And Round - Ratt: This group's best-known hit and it's worth having on here.Big City Nights - Scorpions: When you think of the 80' you have to include a song by these guys.    Shake Me - Cinderella: I think this is their best ""non-ballad"" hit.Give Me All Your Love - Whitesnake: This is what we all say to the one we love.  Preach it Coverdale!Big Talk - Warrant: A classic tough-guy anthem from the band tough enough to also bring us Cherry Pie.  Ha! Hold On To 18 - Black 'N Blue: Hearing this is a reminder of our youth (or at least mine)  Ballroom Blitz - Krokus: They covered this song and made it better",0
"If you want a taste of true non-commercial California sound, pick this one up. It is full of live tracks and very few studio tracks. The band was a well kept secret for years until 1986 when 'At This Momment' was played on Family Ties. Radio stations wanted a copy of the song to play for their listeners. The rest, as they say, is music history. Billy Vera and The Beaters live and breathe music. They are constantly playing dates to the fans that appriciate them, and they will appear in the places you least expect them to be. You might hear them do a TV theme song, or appear in a movie, or talk show. For a time, I also had their little known, out-of-print, Retro Nuevo. Still, this one is always the best for rainy days. And there are plenty to like, such as 'At This Momment', 'Hopeless Romantic', and 'Here Comes The Dawn Again' (I like Billy's opening words on that one). When it comes to California, no one does it better than Billy Vera and the Beaters",0
"We purchased this tunnel for our active but sometime bored (with his present toys), 2 year old Burmese cat. What a hit it has been! The tunnel is a quality-made toy. It's also expandable, that is, it can be attached to other tunnel pieces. The additional pieces were shown in the product insert when it was shipped. The outside is a durable, nylon-type fabric; the inside is a durable, softer fabric. The tunnel is reinforced every 8 inches (about) to stay open during play. Other tunnels we've bought collapsed in short order, but not this one. The cat plays with this, and literally moves it all over the livingroom. He runs back and forth, hides in it, etc. One additional note: our cat is not declawed, and our tunnel appears to have NO picks on it, inside or out. It's GOT to be the best money spent on a toy yet",0
"I purchased the Adorama Slinger Bag after first purchasing the Tamrac Velocity 5.  The Tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag. Unfotunately, it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle.  The Slinger Bag addressed both of these deficiencies.  When worn as a waist bag, it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag.  There are two water pouches on the Slinger Bag (which is a real requirement as I live in Arizona).The Adorama Slinger Bag is a great travel bag. It is light weight and has great utility.  I highly recommend it.",0

"Though I rated it 1 star, I'd give it none if that were an option. I really don't like to write negative reviews, but I feel other parents need to be warned when a product isn't worth the price of shipping, much less the price itself. I thought this would make a fun practice piano for my three year old son. He began piano lessons recently and needs to practice the fingering motions on the keyboard. I wanted something small with few bells and whistles and thought this little keyboard would be perfect for practicing piano fingering. I put 6 fresh batteries in it when it arrived (it does not come with the AC adaptor as mentioned in the instruction manual) and turned it on. For about 3 seconds, there is a fairly nice song. After that it gets garbled and makes a horrid static sound. I poured over the instructions to figure out what I was doing wrong. Nowhere is it mentioned that it should be making this ear-splitting garbled static no matter what button you press.The worst part is - it will probably cost me more to ship it back than I'll get for a refund. This is an utter piece of junk and a waste of plastic. Never again will I buy an item that hasn't been reviewed on Amazon.com. Save your money, be willing to spend a bit more, and find a better keyboard. Frankly, I can't believe Amazon.com would sell this product or not at least test it before selling it",0
"When I first finished The Waste Lands and picked up Wizard and Glass, I was ultra-excited to continue on with the series.  Then I read that Wizard and Glass was basically one huge flashback about Roland's life before the Dark Tower became his sole motivation.  When I read that, I almost considered skipping the book entirely, and just reading a summary in the argument in the next book, but now I am really glad I didn't do that.Wizard and Glass starts out immediately following where The Waste Lands left off.  Roland, Eddie, Susannah, and Jake are aboard Blaine the mono, and they are about to engage in a riddling battle to the death.  Blaine the mono is a really cool character, and I was a little sad to see his story cut short.  Once Blaine has been dealt with, the ka-tet arrives in a version of Topeka, Kansas that has been ravaged by the Superflu.  The ka-tet moves through the abandoned town and eventually starts to catch glimpses of a huge green palace in the distance.  But before they get there, the group palavers one night, and Roland tells them his story.Roland's story is largely a romance between he and a girl he meets when he and his two friends (Cuthbert and Alain) are sent out west by Roland's father.  Roland and Susan fall in love with each other, but their love is forbidden, of course, and meanwhile, Roland is losing focus on what is really important in the Barony of Mejis.  There are a group of men trying to use the town's resources for John Farson, the Good Man, to wage war on the rest of the world.Wizard and Glass is a very long, very in-depth love story at its heart.  Sure, it's got action and suspense and gore, but the meat of the novel is devoted to fleshing out Susan Delgado and the love she shares with Roland.  Obviously, she weighs on Roland's heart all the time, and King wants the reader to understand why.  In my opinion, the reason that the novel is so well done is because of King's patient writing style, and his ability to demand patience from his readers.  The whole book is basically a build-up to about 50 pages worth of climax, but still, once you get there, the previuos 400 pages are all worth it.This novel, I can tell, is where the series might start to go off the deep end.  But that's ok.  The weird situation at the end is still exciting, and it makes you want more.  So as long as there are answers at the end of this, I'm loving the ride",1
"Sea and sky are the trompe l'oeil painter's favorite and best motifs for modern interiors, and here Ursula E. and Martin Benad provide artists with easily-followed introductions to painting clouds, waves and seascapes.

"I found Mr. Cristol's book a great read.  It provides an engrossing fictional account of Israel's attack on USS Liberty during the middle of the Six Day War.  The author does an excellent job of portraying highly skilled and experienced Israeli fighter pilots as being dazed by the ""fog of war"" and thinking they saw a high-speed, enemy destroyer when in fact, it was a slow-speed, WW2 cargo type ship -- laden with antennas.Mr. Cristol's description of only two aircraft making several attack passes at the front of ship, and firing only 30mm cannon in few second bursts, followed by two others attacking from the rear with a couple of napalm bombs, while flying at 600 knots, makes you feel like you're in the pilot's seat.  Unfortunately, the fictional elements of this account don't hold up as well as others because photographs of attack damage clearly show the ship was hit from the front, side and rear by many rockets and 30mm cannon; i.e., the attack involved more than four aircraft, and rockets were the primary weapon.  Nonetheless, it's a good piece of story telling.The torpedo attack is well explained too.  While reading about how seasoned Israeli Motor Torpedo Boat commanders confused the modern looking USS Liberty with an old Egyptian horse carrier, I almost came to believe it was possible.  Both vessels were cargo type ships and they both had a bow and stern.  The author's treatment of this phase of the attack is a brilliant work of fiction.I highly recommend this book to anybody who may be interested in reading a fictional account of the USS Liberty Incident",1
"and i just don't know why bothered to re-produce it if it could not surpass that great and fun older 1982 version(?). the 1982 one, casting with Anthony Andrews, Jane Seymour, Ian McKellen, and James Villiers, is such a great great one, full of fun and suspenses with great performances, great screenplay, while this one, well, (sigh...) played by almost non-likable actors with a loose, contrite, often repeatedly bored over blown screenplay. 3dvd long? is it necessary? we've tried to watch the 2nd one and in the middle of it, we all decided to bail out. because watching the 2nd one was almost like to repeat watching the 1st one and it's very tiresome. skip this one and seek out the great 1982 version. when we watched that one, my two sons were still quite young, not even in the teens, but they always remember that 1982 one, and still reciting those playful dialogue often even they are both grown-ups now. well, now you should know how bad and disappointing this 1999 version is",0

"If you don't need or want the science behind ""Protein Power"" or low carb eating, if you want to eat Low Carb healthy, then this is THE book to get. It's become my bible for low carbing as a way of life. Three small questionnaires show whether low carbing is the way to go for you. A simple chart based on height and weight shows the minimum protein requirements per meal for women and men. The protein serving lists correlate with the protein charts to show what to eat and how much for small, medium, large, extra large, and extra-extra large protein servings. There are three Carbohydrate serving lists: Small servings for the corrective phase of the diet (weight loss or health restoring), Medium servings for transitioning for increasing the amount of carbs when approaching goal weight or health target values, and Large servings for the maintenance phase. What's the point of reducing weight or gaining health if you can't maintain it? Carbohydrate servings include vegetables; fruits; and bread, cereals and grains. Yet another list shows the carb contents and quantities of combination foods (dairy, nuts and soy). There's several lists of what to eat of ""good"" fats. There's a generic easy meal plan, 30-days of meals as examples, how to do exchanges within the carb servings, and a section of recipes including egg dishes and breakfast foods; soups and salads; meat, fish and fowl dishes; vegetable dishes; vegetarian dishes; desserts and preserves; and condiments. Not only have I lost weight from 134 (March 2005) down to 113 (June, 2005) and maintaining (I'm 4'11), I've gained health. My blood values are all within normal ranges. I have more energy, my moods have leveled out, my clothes fit beautifully and look good, I don't have any more sugar cravings or the feeling that there's not enough food on the planet to satisfy me, and I can easily adapt this way of eating to restaurants, social events,  and vacationing. In fact, I lost a pound while out of town in Memphis, TN over the long Memorial Day weekend, 2005. By the way, there's a wonderful list of what to eat when dining out at many kinds of restaurants in the book ""Protein Power,"" pages 126-130. I have several of my patients in my acupuncture clinic following this way of eating through this book. Both are early stage adult-onset diabetics, both have dropped nearly 40 pounds in 4 to 5 months, both had gastric reflux which lessened and one with sleep apnea greatly improved. Blood sugar values for both have dropped. One patient was able to forego taking any medication for her diabetes, the other had her doseage reduced. Both of their general practitioner doctors are highly pleased.This book is well worth your time and money. You've everything to gain (health and life)",1
"This catchy phrase was a quote by one Evolution Dieter as reported in the section called ""Appropriate Your Diet."" It is a perfect explanation of this common-sense diet that challenges the reader to deny cultural and physical influences and return to a healthier, more natural style of eating. The premise is simple: eat the way our bodies were designed to eat. To do this, we must know a little about the human body and what it needs to function properly. The author explains this without getting bogged down with scientific terms and equations. We must also know how our culture influences our diets, in large part so that we can know how not to eat. Morse shows us what a `culture-less diet' would look like and then shows us how such a program can be followed.The Evolution Diet excels where similar historical diets fail in that it emphasizes not only what to eat, but when and how to eat those foods. For instance, if we're preparing for bed, there is no reason to eat a large bowl of ice cream and chocolate syrup. That kind of food is designed to energize and if one eats it before bedtime, sleep will most likely be hindered. Eat that before working out if you have to eat it at all. At night, eat a hearty steak that is designed to rebuild exhausted muscles and bones, a process that consequently makes you tired. Throughout the day, keep the metabolism going (and avoid falling asleep at work) with low sugar, high fiber (""LoS Hi-Fi"") foods like crackers, grains, or some vegetables. In short: ""food for work, food for play, and food for the rest of the day.""It's a formula that just makes sense and, after a few weeks of eating this way, makes you wonder how in the world you used to eat five strawberry waffles and syrup before sitting in front of a TV all day",1
"Being a John Wayne fan since I was a kid inticed me into purchasing this CD. It's great! The orchestrationals by the City of Prague Philharmonic Music was really great. It really brought back fond memories of my watching &quot;The Duke&quot; on the big silver screen when I was young, and today when I'm watching him on my CD's.  I do share one thought with one of the previous reviewers though, I would have like this to have been a &quot;double&quot; CD, to include many of the &quot;Duke's&quot; other great films as well",0
"With the record number of Oscars won by the William Wyler 1959 version of BEN-HUR, there is a tendency to overlook the monumental 1925 production, which established MGM as a studio to be reckoned with. Well, if you've never seen the earlier version, you may be in for a surprise...it is as enjoyable in nearly every way!Certainly, some of the performances (particularly Francis X. Bushman's scenery-chewing Messala) are cartoonish, the film lacks the widescreen splendor and scope of it's successor, and the 'Wyler Touch', the infinite care the legendary director poured over every detail, is sorely missed. But the 1925 production, beset by so many problems that it became the most expensive film ever made, brought new production head Irving Thalberg into the limelight, and his first decision was brilliant, firing the current director, and bringing in veteran director Fred Niblo to take charge. Niblo brought an energy and sense of intimacy to the silent ""Ben-Hur"" that is actually often lacking in the later version. The finished film, as a whole, is far closer in spirit to General Lew Wallace's novel, and young leading man Ramon Novarro (with a sexy intensity reminiscent of Tyrone Power), makes a far more charismatic and sympathetic Ben-Hur than Charlton Heston's more iconic portrayal.The 1959 version is remembered today primarily for the chariot race, one of the most spectacular action sequences ever filmed. But what of the other 'set piece', the gigantic sea battle between the Roman and pirate fleets? The scene is patently artificial, obviously comprised of model ships in a tank and rear projections (watch the tiny toy seamen jiggle as ships collide!) The 1925 version's chariot race is fast-paced and certainly exciting, and the sea battle is astonishing, using full-sized ships and hundreds of extras (shot in Italy, where an actual fire broke out on the ships during the battle...the extras' panic onscreen was NOT acting...) With an early two-strip Technicolor to emphasize key scenes (the Nativity, the new Roman Consul's arrival in Jerusalem...yes, those ARE topless women leading the procession!), and a wonderful, stirring new musical score by Carl Davis, Fred Niblo's BEN-HUR is a treasure, a film certainly worthy to stand beside the 1959 version",0
"To an adult, this book doesn't seem like anything all that special.  It's about colored dots.  The story is sweet, though, and easy for young children to appreciate.  My multi-age 3-5 year old classroom loved it (I used it with our science unit on colors). It's great for talking about color (blue and yellow make green) and about appreciating differences (race).  I heard a horror story from a fellow teacher about this book that other teachers should be aware of:  a kindergarten teacher read this book to her students and was repremanded by her principal.  He said that when little blue and little yellow hug, and make green, it is sexual.  He also said that it is racist that little blue's parents are blue and little yellow's parents are yellow and this does not reflect a multi-cultural view.  Both of these seem silly to me.  Just be aware.Personally, I love it and so did my students",1

"Ehrenreich is the kind of journalist I despise. One who thinks her insights are so important that it doesn't matter how much she inconveniences others to make her point.She constantly drones about how difficult it is to find housing on the wages blue color workers earn.  The market is to tight, that oftentimes one has to use a huge percentage of one's pay to stay in hotels while looking for apartments.  Does that stop Ehrenreich from competing for those coveted apartments?  Of course not.  She has to do her research, and she is the only reliable subject she can find to satisfy her curiousity.  If jobs and apartments are so hard to come by, then leave those jobs and digs for the people who so desparately need them.  There is nothing one learns from Ehrenreich's experiences that one couldn't have learned from professional interviews of blue color workers.  But that would have taken away Ehrenreich's righteous indignation.  Don't encourage this kind of writing.  See it for what it is. Gratuitous research that could have been easily conducted without firsthand experience.  And that while doing it, some very needy people were out of work and living in substandard housing conditions",1

"This is a great book for lay people. Many books of this type are too academic, densely written or boring to the average non-professional reader who might be interested in this topic. The writer makes the concept so easy  to understand. It's filled with examples of interesting (and often  beautiful) art work with words and stories by the creators. Very powerful  to have the individuals who themselves have gone through life-threatening  illnesses and traumatic situations talk about the healing power of art.  Particularly fascinating to see examples of how art can be used globally  and with the environment. Kudos to the all the people who shared so  honestly their intimate stories and viewpoints, and congratulations to the  author for compiling such a compelling body of work",1
"""Koyaanisqatsi"" took seven years to make, from 1975 to 1982. There is not a narration to tell you what to think. This is an art film, in my opinion, the value is up to the viewer: Is this film meaningful? Does it have value? As a viewer I say yes. This film is a fusion of music and image. In Koyaanisqatsi there are 17 pieces of music and five movements all have relative relationship to one another. The ""Grid"" is a polyrhythmic piece of music. There are 11 polyrhythimic structues going on at once, and it matches with the time lapsed photography that is occuring on screen. About 350,000 feet of film was shot. There definitely was a method to this madness: after the explosion of the Grid, these polyrhythmic structures settle the audience down and the film ends the way it began: a rocket ship taking off.Godfrey Reggio more than expected a negative reaction by some people when he made this film. What does this film mean? That is up to the viewer, like a piece of art work there may be a thousand or more interpretations related to this film. Is this film only for certain individuals? Probably. But I don't think there is any pretense in interpretating this films message. One does not have to pretend to like or dislike an art object; it has no intrisic meaning or value only what can be ascribed to it by the viewer.Godfrey stated that Koyaanisqatsi is related to Northern Hemisphere societies; super-sophisticated, hyper-industrial, technological grids that we call societies. To me this film is about how humans have become one with machines. And how we don't live with nature any longer. We have become not affected by technology so much more that we have become so engrained in it we can no longer see out of it. That technology becomes the host in which everything happens and in that way, we do not use technology, it is a way of life. But like the air we breath we can not distance ourselves, as we deny that we are separate from technology and instead of moving us toward control of nature it has alienated us instead. The norms of nature no longer fully exist; it is rather the norms of technology that do. And in so doing technology has become omnipresent. Personally I don't have to pretend to like this film or pretend it is important. In fact it is, as its message is perhaps even more significant today as the world moves even closer to a homogenized society at the expense of natural and human diversity.This film shows that homogenization is in this process of globalization",0
"For all design professionals, modernism addicts, and even the layperson.  The book is filled with wonderful images culled from a lifetime of decorating.

"This book is a well-written, easy to read introduction to Luther's doctrine of vocation.  Veith explores the doctrine of vocation and shows that it not only gives value to work, it is also the key to Christian ethics.  In the introductory paragraphs, Veith explains how the doctrine of vocation is how God is at work in the normal day-to-day activities of people's lives.  In providing daily bread for his people, for example, God is at work in the human callings of farmers, bakers, truck drivers, factory workers, wholesalers, retailers, etc.  Different vocations, then, are rightly understood as secondary means which God has ordained to accomplish his purposes.  Veith then devotes a chapter to each of the major vocations: our calling as a worker, our calling in the family, our calling as a citizen, and our calling in the church.  In these chapters, he explores relevant biblical texts dealing with each of the vocations and demonstrates their application through real-life examples.  To wrap up the book, Veith spends a couple chapters on the ethical implications of the doctrine of vocation and how it works to shed light on controversial ethical questions (euthanasia, abortion, etc.).  I enjoyed this book thoroughly, and after reading it, I finally understood clearly how the Reformation eliminated the medieval sacred/secular distinction.  It's all sacred.  It's God at work",1
"Tom Wolfe has a very large head, containing (I imagine) a very large brain, and here he puts it to good use, chronicling the Hippie Messiah, Ken Kesey, as he guided the nascent hippie movement from psychedelic inception to co-optation. Wolfe writes in the typical Wolfian way, with plenty of obscure vocabulary, and endless clauses. Kesey is an interesting figure, and the period of time covered by Wolfe is fascinating (albeit started in media res). Particulary interesting is the coolness between Kesey and pointy-heads Timothy Leary and Rammed Ass, upon their intersection at Millbrook. Kesey had something going, something novel and unique. Of course, it was based solely on drugs, and Kesey tried, and failed, to surmount that. The world moved on, and the original spirit of the Pranksters dissipated. But it was a helluva ride while it lasted. Read five pages of the book. If you like it, keep going; if you don't, there's always The Da Vinci Code",1
"I loved this series. Satrapi has captured the alienation of one caught between two cultures; who is neither at home anywhere, nor fully understood by her family and friends in both countries. Through her books, readers are given a cultural and humanizing tour of Iran: a country North Americans hear much about in international political news, but usually know little about as a society, a culture, and a people. Satrapi is the great-grand-daughter of deposed Iranian royalty. Because her family is upperclass, liberal, and socially active; they teach Marjane to be intelligent and brave. But living on her own in Europe is quite the task for any teenager, let alone a foreign national. I admired her struggles with French and German. It reminded me of when I lived, studied, and worked abroad; how one can be surrounded by well-meaning foreign friends, actively engaged in a new culture, and still feel quite alienated. Upon Satrapi's return to Iran, her travails under the oppressive regime are reinforced by the stark black and white illustrations. The art is minimalistic, but it beautifully captures the human drama of her circumstances. The story deals with the complex effects and emotions created by war, religious fundamentalism, political extremism, gendered oppression, homelessness, violence, and being a refugee. This series is a wonderfully rich read, and I hope to see more volumes as Satrapi's life progresses",1
"One of the most comprehensive, comprehensible, and persuasive defenses of  naturalism that I have encountered. A pleasure to read. The ideas are expressed simply, succinctly, and without excessive philosophical jargon. The chapters, arguments, and critiques are presented in a smooth and logical fashion.Some minor points: while related references are listed at the end of each chapter, it would have been helpful to embed specific citations and acknowledge related work by other authors within the body of the text. Some topics are delved into somewhat superficially that deserve a deeper treatment- indeed, whole books can be (and have been) written on each one of Carrier's topics. However, this shortcoming is quite forgivable given the comprehensive scope of the book. Without a doubt, this is the book I would recommend to anyone who seeks (or who questions the possibility of) a coherent, intellectually defensible, and yet emotionally and aesthetically satisfying non-theistic worldview based on science and reason. Congratulations to Richard Carrier on producing a fine and important book.",1

This will be helpful for those of us who have their hands full with kids, work and balancing the demands of a household with preparing for a party.There are imaginative ideas for serving and garnishing: Spoonfuls with Polenta Bites and Caramelized Mushrooms served in individual spoons; Pumpkin Risotto served in a Chinese spoon as an hors d'oeuvre; even the inside a squash for an individual serving and in a serving bowl on a buffet.

"In ""The City, Not Long After,"" Pat Murphy has written an engrossing tale of post-apocalyptic Northern California, where a plague has wiped out most of the population.  Much of San Francisco has become a giant canvas on which artists have used the city's resources to create works of wonder.  A military dictatorship in Sacramento, however, is working to ""reunite the country"" and threatens to use force to add the jewel of the Bay Area to its empire.  A young woman named Jax has been given the task by her dying mother to warn the citizens of the coming storm. She is somewhat distracted by her personal search for her mother, who had promised her daughter that she would be going ahead to San Francisco to prepare the way.  Jax must learn some her mother's secrets in order to help the community of scholars and artists find a way to repel the invasion.  Exactly how should artists respond to the menace of guns and bombs when such things are abhorrent to them?Murphy's characters and their artistic creations seem so full of life - in my mind's eye I can almost envision them inhabiting the various neighborhoods of the City by the Bay.  The story itself is sad at times (but not overly depressing), haunting and quite memorable.The underlying message of the novel can be phrased as a question: How much of a price are people willing to pay for peace?  Though written nearly 20 years ago, the novel's message seems particularly resonant today, in a time when many Americans are willing to sacrifice personal freedoms and human lives in the name of finding peace and security",1
"Some of the psychiatrists or psychiatrists in training that have reviewed this book are sadly influenced by the ideologies and pressupositions of their industry. The fact is, science has never proven that there is such a thing as a non-organic mental illness. The reason why people behave the way they do and have a variety of symptoms is far more complex than ""they are lacking some serotonin."" Most psychiatrists have already bought into the myth of chemical imbalance as CAUSATIVE of illness. Deep down they have to know this is a leap, if they are truly honest (the human mind is too complex to reduce to single neurotransmitters). Glasser and others have pointed out this leap for years. It is in the best interest of the patient to be honest with them and to genuinely help them get better and live better lives, not just hand them a prescription and say, ""See you in a month."" Drugs can be helpful for some but they are not the CURE of anything",1

"Despite the horror flick-sounding title Sandra Bullock's first starring role in a romantic comedy remains a great movie.  Sure, it's full of sentimental music and oft-unbelievable antics--but the bumbling character Bullock plays and the sweet storyline keep the film from going into overbearingly-sweet territory.  The performances are brilliant and the story is great.  In the end a perfect romantic comedy if there ever was one",0
"I got this book out of curiosity as a fan of both Duquette and Hyatt that it came with a warning how shocking it was. It is about the ""blasphemous"" concept of merging sex with religion. Why this is controversial is because the Christian church teaches sex for any other purpose than procreation is sinful and all sinners of course go to hell. Well now that I've almost gotten Christianity completely out of my life I'm not scared of the thought that I could very possibly go to hell and rot for all eternity nor do I fear that I will not go to heaven. Christianity is gradually losing its stranglehold on American society and I've been a practicing occultist long enough where the ""shocking nature"" alegedly of the book's contents just seemed like typical Crowleyesque teachings. I credit Duquette and Hyatt with much needed originality in the field of occult literature and also give thanks to Crowley for having an almost unending depth to his own teachings and character. Get this book if you've seen almost everything to the point where nothing really shocks you and you want an original book on esoteric subject matter. I tried other forms of the occult and the Satanism of Anton LaVey was too stuck in Christianity to the point where they almost pigeonholed themselves into the belief system to the point where after all was said and done Satanism was just another religion. Wicca/Witchcraft were actually the same thing and a really bad watered down ripoff of Aleister Crowley and with almost all Wicca 101 books being basically the same as well as more obscure stuff like candle magick it was all the same too. I like the originality of Crowleyesque literature while at the same time being almost stereotypical/cliche but also disturbing. Crowley, etc. didn't act like everything was such a big deal unlike Satanism.",1

"This has got to be one of the most inventive and stirring ""graphic novels"" ever published. (Actually the term graphic novel is a misnomer here because it's a non-fiction memoir.) The story concerns how David B grew up in France under the shadow of his brother's illness. His brother had severe epilepsy, with serious seizures every day, and ended up chronically ill and unstable, both physically and mentally. While the family wasted their time and hopes on all sorts of homeopathic quacks and mystical charlatans, David B felt himself battling insanity and loneliness, perhaps convinced that epilepsy would get him too, after already destroying the stability of his family. It's a unique life story, but what possibly matters more here is David B's incredible artwork. His work is overwhelmingly dark, with a great amount of black ink illustrating both literal and allegorical darkness. His style also greatly utilizes frightening surrealism, and he has a great ability to illustrate fear and frustration symbolically. My favorite example is David B's depiction of his brother's epilepsy as a Chinese dragon that erupts from his brother's body and looms ominously over the family, while his brother himself is later depicted as a dark and threatening bogeyman when his behavior is damaged by seizures and psychosis. In addition to being a truly scary and saddening story of how regular people must deal with a loved one's terrifying illness, this book is also a feast for the eyes, with superbly eye-catching and thought-provoking artwork.

Maybe it should be ""Networking to Self-Actualization.""  Regardless, it is a great book.  All who are in sales should read it.  Even those who just want to better themselves should read it.  ""Ten Commitments of Networking"" was a breeze to read.  The first 1/3 of the book discusses maximizing your potential.  I loved that part.   James explains that self-actualized people know their purpose.  They have passion.James discusses goals or ""specific intentions"" as he calls them.  He stresses the importance of writing them down.   Even more important than goals are purposes.  Goals are means to achieve a purpose.  Everyone should have a purpose in their life, but James point out that 87% of the public does not have a purpose to their lives.""We all live our lives like a movie.""  That statement made me think.  Remember the books that would have several different endings.  You were able to choose which one you preferred.  Life is like that, according to James.  ""Consider the fact that your life is the way it is because of the choices you have made up to this point.""  James defines networking as, ""using your creative talents to help others achieve their goals as you cultivate a network of people strategically positioned to support you in your goals.....expecting nothing in return!""  He does not mention the golden rule, but it is the underlying point.  Get people to remember you and like you by being nice.  What a great concept.  Don't you wish more people believed in it?  James mentions practical ways of increasing one's networking skills.  I will be sure to use many of the suggested tips.  The chapter ""Post Quips"" was inspiring.  It was a few pages of quotations from James and others that are thought-provoking.  All-in-all, ""Ten Commitments of Networking"" is a great book.  I loved it.  Anyone in sales will benefit from the practical tips.  Self-employed people will find means to increase their brand.  Larry James is like a coach for those who have to promote themselves.  As he has written, ""Good coaches bring out the best in people.""",1

"If you have ever had a creative block, lacked inspiration or wanted to try something different then purchase this book and let the juices flow.  A wonderful book that you will refer to over and over again.  You will want to try all the techniques and more. Buy it now and you won't regret it. A+++++++++++",1

  I happened to hear this in an mp3 newsgroup and immediately bought it for my folks and several other people. It is an incredible performance and unlike anything usually heard around Christmas . I listen to Classical music all day while working and yet I've never heard this before . Everyone who received it loved it.,0
"This knife is by far the best paring knife I've ever used. A few passeson the steel and it's almost razor sharp.  Holds its edge for a long while. Peeling onions, potatoes and quartering them is a breeze.  I purchased their Santuku knife along with this one as a pair.  The Santuku stands up to the cutting and chopping chores with ease.  Both knives are a good buy. You can't go wrong with either one. I usually pass them across the steel just before putting them away. An excellent buy",0
"There is no other story told and re-told as much as P&P.  This book transcends many generations with a true and tested story.  The characters and story line are so similiar to this day and age.  Austen's poetic writing gives readers a sense of the social times as well as insight to each character's thoughts.  I read this book every year and see all the movies based on it.  Love it, love it, love it",0

"Oscar Petersen's jazz version of Bernstein's West Side Story on all seven selections should be in everyone's collection. Ray Brown's bass and Ed Thigpen'  drums round out the trio. As the liner notes say,  This is the trio making jazz, Listen . What a soul this remarkable living legend obviously possesses.If great jazz is important to, do yourself a good deed, and get hold of a copy. Trust me, you will never regret it",0
"Fareed Zakaria is an excellent foreign policy analyst and this book is no different.  He argues that without a strong middle class, democracy is doomed to fail, and in fact can make things worse.  One cannot help to see what is happening in the middle east right now, where oil-rich nations elect terrorist-supporting officials.  Contrary to the Bush doctrine, forced-upon democracy is not the answer to our world's greatest threat.  A must-read.",1
I bought this mount to hang a 50 inch Panasonic plasma TV.  I had the mount up and the TV hanging on the wall in 20 minutes.  This product comes with all of the mounting hardware for hundreds of TVs.  The only thing that I used different was to use larger lag bolts (3/8 X 3 inch lag bolt) to secure the bracket on the wall. ,0
"Unconventional Means - The Dream Down Under, is one of those books that stays with you for days after you've read it. It is a hauntingly beautiful story of a woman, the author, who literally allows her dreams - real dreams, not the ""I have a dream"" kind, to lead her on a self-healing journey that is unforgettable.I don't usually read this type of book, but Unconventional Means came highly recommended, so I started reading it. I was immediately pulled into this story and couldn't put it down. But more than that, it stayed with me for days, and I still think about it as I go through my day, sometimes.I recommend this book to everyone. Unconventional Means proves again that truth really is sometimes stranger than fiction",1
"This book is a wonderful piece of fiction. I hesitate to really call it ""humor"", because while I find it amusing that the book is presented as deathly serious, it doesn't really make me laugh while reading it. Rather, I think this book is just well-designed as a no-nonsense guide to living through a Zombie attack. Perhaps the best thing about the book is that it advises you NOT to be a hero, it warns against trying to take on hordes of undead. It tells you to be reasonable; avoid confrontation unless necessary. It treats its reader as an average suburbanite. Brook's Zombies are based IN PART on the works of George A. Romero, famous creator of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and the ""Dawn/Day/Land of the Dead"" movies. Brooks differentiates his creations, however, by keeping them solely within the realm of the mundane. There is a clear explaination on how they come about, and though the way in which the virus Solanum turns the human brain into a hard-wired, anaerobic eating machine is not fully understood, Brooks never relies on mysticism to explain the Walking Plague.Perhaps the most affecting part of the book is the ""Recorded Outbreaks"" section, which describes actual Zombie outbreaks throughout history. Late at night, after reading some of these accounts, I would feel the need to occasionally look out the window, just in case there was an approaching pack of mindless undead heading my way.This book is not for everyone, however. Clearly, it requires a certain sense of humor to be willing to sit down and read this book. I like to say that it's funny BECAUSE it's not funny. Some people don't get that type of humor. I personally have a friend who thinks the Guide is just stupid. People like this are better off watching Shaun of the Dead, which is a great movie but contains much more obvious humor that they will have an easier time relating to.Overall, this book is a great piece of fiction that subtly works quite hard to present itself as fact. A must-read if you aren't ardently against extremely subtle humor",1
"I recommend this book to anyone who tells me they need help with a nonfiction proposal.  Literally.  I can't think of a better resource on the market in terms of giving concrete examples and explaining what a proposal should accomplish, and how precisely it should be organized.  A MUST for anyone looking to nail down a nonfiction proposal",1
"Great book, great shipper.  Came fast and I am happy with the whole purchase",1
"This is probably the best book ever written on the subject of waterbaptism. Thorough, complete, liberating. A minor comment one could make is the confusion with baptism with the Spirit at some points, but the writer's monumental explanation of the sacramental value of believer's baptism makes up for it for sure. In short the writer is saying that baptism is a expression of saving faith that perfects that same saving faith - with all the wonderful blessings of salvation! (James 2:22",1
"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read.  Not only is it informative, but it also is written in a clever style that is fun to read. The book traces the evolution of American philosophical thought - pragmatism. Americans are sometimes accused of not contributing much to world philosophy.  The Metaphysical Club shows both why that accusation is false and why it is so often made.  Unlike many other cultures, American does not produce individual great philosophers. No American philosopher has his own -ism.  Americans produce methods and teams to address problems or issues.  Philosophy is no different.  A pragmatic philosophy is built by many thinkers, each contributing and correcting the ones that went before.  It is very much like the scientific method, where ideas are tested & modified and where practitioners recognize that absolute truth is unattainable Louis Menand makes this interesting by tracing the intellectual lives of such such well known personalities as William James, John Dewey, Charles Pierce and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.  He describes their interactions, flaws and successes.  In doing this, he describes the creation of a unique American philosophy.  In the end their collective contribution to philosophy is greater than the sum of all their contributions.  A team usually is better than even the greatest individual and recent books like The Wisdom of Crowds or The Long Tail give some ideas about why this should be so. The Metaphysical Club is a great book that should be read by anyone interested in philosophy or just looking to learn more about interesting people. ",1
"      What we have here is a criminal genius; Star Parker was a professional at working the late '70s/ early '80s welfare system. This is one lady projecting her pathological abuse of the welfare system onto an entire nation and political system, with potentially catastrophic results.     Star gives an account of her welfare days: selling medicare vouchers for profit, working under the table, and getting pregnant four times, all as ways to fatten her pocketbook and live off the system. In hearing Star talk about the financial luxuries of her life on the welfare system, don't forget that she wasn't just a welfare recipient, she was a con artist who puts the leaders of our country to shame.           Star's conversion to Christianity seems to be her main asset. The fact that she's become religious seemingly cancels out anything that she's done in the past. Can a few trips to church cleanse a soul so sullied? Or, more pertinently, does it give one the right to judge the morals of others?        This portrayal of the ""Welfare Queen"" at her most wretched must have fulfilled every fantasy of the right-wing agenda-pushers. One can't help but wonder if this is Star's most brilliant con job yet. They must have paid her millions to get out there and sell the party line to a previously untapped audience.        For somebody who is into taking responsibility for her life, Star points a lot of fingers outward. If morality was taught in school, she wouldn't have been promiscuous, if there was no welfare, she would have seized her life. After reading this book, it's hard not to get the impression that such a developed criminal mind wouldn't have found other ""creative"" inroads to easy money.       ",1
"I am an international preschool teacher in Japan whose husband also happens to be Japanese (I am American) and I found this book to be very insightful and relevant to both my professional and personal lives.  It is extremely well written, easy-to-follow, and above all interesting.  The author explains the acquisition of a second language in very understandable terms.  I enjoyed to book imencly",1
amazing price for a BRAND NEW book. very very satisfied with this purchase and it also arrived in a timely manner.,1
"I agree with the reviewer that said she didn't learn anything new. Although the list of what is in the book is impressive, I didn't learn anything I didn't already glean from articles or other books. The writing has a forced""compassionate"" sound to it which is consistent with the author, who is a know-it-all. Reading the book is better than meeting the author as your doctor in person",1
"The prose, while difficult is not a real obstacle to this text.  Primarily this book is not about paganism, Asatru, or those communities, rather it is about how the trappings of these things that have been co-opted by White Separatists in North America.  The bulk of the text is used to establish the context of how this has come about.  With so many Americans having no real knowledge of the White Separatist movement it is important for the author to explain the progression of Ariosophy and later Christian Identity into the realm of racists adopting Asatru trappings esp. those of the 'folkish' type.By the last third, when Gardell really gets into the modern racist/pagan crossover the reader should understand that these are not your typical pagans.  These are a group of ideologically inbred folk who are seeking to escape the faith they can not justify and replace it with something that better fits their ideals.  Let's be honest, ""Love those that hate you,"" is harder than hell to justify if you hate everyone not like you.  So the adoption of a form of Asatru as, 'the religion of the Aryan people,' is easy to understand.  The in had been around for a long time in the form of the racialist or more folkish Asatru and Odinians like Edred Thorsson.For this I must say that I found the presentation of Edred Thorsson's position to be sympathetic.  Gardell apparently just let Thorsson talk about his perspective, one that has been presented elsewhere by Edred, often in his own books, and quoted him.  Thorsson has long held that individuals should honor the gods and goddesses of their own ancestors.  This position, while having a certain ethnic-heritage logic is not one that lends itself to the principles of liberal tolerance that we so often hear from the pagan community.  I found no attack on either Thorrson or racialist pagans to be present.  Perhaps many of the reviewers who did might want to consider why they feel so strongly about an academic text that presents very little commentary until the conclusion where you may disagree with his analysis but frankly there is not much of that.My favorite criticism that seems to be labeled at this book though is the clear Marxist/post-modernist biases so many seem to find here.  Gardell starts with early American commentaries on race and how the perception of race has changed over the last two and a half centuries.  From Ben Franklin referring to, ""swarthy Swedes,"" and their inferiority to the white race (read WASP) to the modern madness of skin tone determining race he seems well-justified in the declaring of race a cultural construct.  For the review by Prometheus all I have to say is that just over a century and a half ago the Irish were considered to be nothing more than, 'white-niggers,' by the English and less than dogs in the States when they fled an artificial, state-created famine.  The Irish race was damn real then, but now they are just white.  Get a grip.  Gardell is just establishing that at its core the term racist really means anyone who believes in the validity of the theory of race at any level.  They may not be bigots, but for this text they are racists.  That is neither a Marxist nor a post-modernist position in itself; it is just demonstrable fact that bites into an ideology that is untenable.  This makes it much like both Marxism and post-modernism.This book is for everyone.  It is a clear and cogent history of the theologies that have been used to justify racist theories.  It should be used as a wake-up call to the Asatru community that one day some idiots are going to get some real media attention for some bombing or high-profile assassination and they will shape what the public believes Asatru to be.  It is a PR nightmare that could be diffused if the Asatru community really got its act together and started not merely distancing itself from this kind of stupidity but was seen to castigate and berate the forms of racist Asatru that Gardell looks at.By the last third, when Gardell really gets into the modern racist/pagan crossover the reader should understand that these are not your typical pagans.

"I normally wouldn't respond to a review of my own book, but I couldn't let this one go.  ""Mark Twain"" wrote this: ""The focus of the book seems to be how to try every snake oil solution first, add in a lot of prayer and then seek help from qualified ABA therapists.""  If Mark actually read the book, he would have seen that the FIRST therapy that we did was ABA!  As a matter of fact, within minutes of getting our diagnosis, I was on the phone with an ABA professional.  He also would have seen that the very FIRST therapy I present in the book is ABA, and the FIRST appendix I have is a list of ABA professionals around the world!  I believe that ABA is key and it was the foundation of our treatment.  After doing ABA for quite a while (and seeing excellent results from it), we learned that we needed to address underlying biomedical issues within our son's body AS WELL.  That is when we began researching dietary and biomedical interventions.  I now believe that ABA and biomedical interventions help each other.  ABA was a great way to teach our son, while the biomedical treatments addressed his physical issues, which in turn allowed ABA to work even better!  When I wrote this book, I had two main things in mind.  I wanted to give parents hope for their child when faced with the diagnosis of autism, by showing them what happened with our own son.  I also wanted give them practical help by presenting treatment options available so that they could make informed decisions for their child.  ABA is a fantastic therapy, and I recommend it highly, but there are other things that are benefiting children as well, including dietary and biomedical treatments.  There is hope and there is help!",1
"I think that ""The Cat in the Hat"" is a very good book and I recomend it to every child that has a passion for reading books. Dr. Seuss is an incredible author that is wonderful at rhyming in his liturature.Being able to write books like ""The Cat in the Hat"" will be spectacular because like Dr. Seuss, I would be very talented. If I had a chance to read this book many times, i'd take my chances",0
"In the first installment, when the proposed party conference theme of ""FINDING THE RIGHT WAY"" turns up as simply ""THE RIGHT WAY"" at the actual event, the lines have been brightly drawn for the viewer. The preceding and following interactions between the needs of governing, personal ambition, money, corporate influence and a tainted media all join in a hilarious and terrifying Danse Macabre. Presented with such dark and furious glee, the story lines, subplots, acting, casting and surgically-lit observations of character combine for moments of the blackest comedy and the most tragic drama. It's easy to understand why such a view of the political system would never have a U.S. equivalent: it comes way too close to the truth of things for Joe n' Jolene Voter. That's because the greed, divisive partisanship, set-in-stone ideology and hubris on display here is only barely fiction. From ""nothing like starting your own little war to see a lift in the polls"" to defining freedom in business terms, manipulating the press from both ends and shutting off assistance to the poor and needy, good ol' Francis Urquhart -- affectionately known as F.U. -- may seem strangely strange, yet oddly familiar.While it's imperative to pay attention to the day-to-day details of our own government's action and inaction, nothing is as effective in communicating the dismal and all too human antics of politicians as wrapping up all the specifics with a keenly observed, nuanced and entertaining summary of what makes these folks tick. Which is to say cap ""P"" power or, as F.U. puts it, ""The getting of it, and the holding on...."" Regardless of the age, era or epoch, ""House of Cards"" nails it. Coming as it does on the heels of Reagan's America and Thatcher's Great Britain, the ""House of Cards"" trilogy is even more appropriate to the long, hard and fruitless slog we now share under George the Second. Power indeed",0
"The second album by the greatest band ever to hail from Vancouver is another winner.  I have no idea why they aren't among the biggest names in music.  They are well known, but they should be huge.  Every song on the disc just ripples with talent and musical intelligence.  This is without question some of the most energetic, brilliant, and passionate music in indie rock.All of the members of the band are involved in other musical projects or have solo careers of their own (co-lead vocalist Neko Case, for instance, here in Chicago, where she has moved).  Perhaps because of that or perhaps because they refuse to release anything that isn't utterly outstanding, they have managed to release only three albums in their eight years of existence.  But though their releases are few, they make up for it by being close to perfect.  There truly is not a bad cut on this album.  Even the weakest cuts have numerous interesting moments, while the strongest cuts are so great they can send bolts of joy through your system.  When you hear a song like ""The Laws Have Changed"" you can easily convince yourself that you haven't heard many better songs in your life.  And then when you hear ""It's Only Divine Right"" you know it can't be true since it is at least as good.This is a tight, tight band and every song bristles with wonderful musical touches.  Because all the members are such seasoned professionals, they obviously know how to add just the right touch to properly embellish a song without weighing it down.  And everyone in the band is so outstanding at what they do it is hard to single a single member out for praise.  Nonetheless, I have to hand out kudos to two members.  Carl Newman, more or less the leader of the band, has on all their albums managed to generate a fabulous set of songs.  However, I wish he would give up singing lead on so many songs.  Why?  Because Neko Case is just a stunning vocalist.  Every time she takes over the lead vocals I get a bit of a charge running down my spine.  She has a marvelously nonchalant nasal voice and just seems to toss the lyrics almost without effort, as opposed to Newman, who while competent always seems to be working.  Perhaps it is Case's non-Vancouver residence that keeps her from assuming more of the vocals, but if she were to do all the singing, this band would be almost impossibly great.The great news for anyone who loves this album is that the band has two other albums that are at least as good as this one, perhaps even better.  All three are must-own albums.  So if you don't know these guys, go out immediately and get familiar with them.  They are easily one of the best bands in the world",0
"Hmm, you'd think for such a paradigm breaking book Lubenow would have the credentials necessary for this critical analysis. No, Ph.D. in anthropology (or even in the biological sciences for that matter), no published peer-reviewed journal articles dealing with the issue at hand.

This book is a very easy to read seemingly well documented work but it will not provide the reader with Thomas Jefferson in historical context. If your interest is in what Mr. Jefferson accomplished during his life and the many great achievements that he participated in on behalf the formation of the United States I would pass up this work.  If your interest lies in his carnal side and his personal sexual history this might be more your speed.  Had I known this was the piece of fluff that it turned out to be I would not have wasted my money on this work.  This book would probably be a good basis for daytime TV couch potato fare.  It is hardly a good work of historical content and most likely would have been rejected by any Masters level thesis committee.  Most of this book could be condensed into one chapter.On a number of occasions Mr Halliday lets his own personal political bias color his image of Mr. Jefferson pushing this work even further from the vein of relevant history.I picked up this work based upon the recommendations on the inside cover.  I have always been impressed with the historical works of Mr. Ambrose but I believe that there must have been more to his review.,1

"Great collection of success literature. I especially enjoyed Acres of Diamonds:Russell Conwell's book, ""Acres of Diamonds"" was developed from a speech he delivered to church congregations over 5,000 times. The proceeds he earned from this speech are reputed to have given him a fortune, which he used to found Temple University in Philadelphia.""Acres of Diamonds"" is the story of a successful farmer in India named Al Hafed. Hafed is tempted by the allure of wealth and sells his farm to search the world for diamonds. Years later he dies penniless, having not found diamonds. However, back home the man who purchased Hafed's farm accidentally discovers a huge field of diamonds on Hafed's former land.Conwell uses this story to illustrate that success often lies close at hand, if you are willing to open your eyes and mind to opportunity. Conwell further suggests that most people are ""pygmies of their possible selves,"" rarely achieving the potential of their innate abilities or local opportunities. Conwell also discusses his basic philosophy of business and gives several rules, or suggestions, for budding entrepreneurs:1.	The seeds of fortune are close at hand. Stick with what you know, find your niche, and don't be swayed by the allure of ""greener pastures.""2.	Find out what people want, and fill that need. This sounds obvious, but many entrepreneurs start with a product or service, and then try to find a market for their product or service. Conwell advises finding the market first, then developing a product or service to meet that demand.3.	Make the best possible product and provide them to a large number of people.""Acres of Diamonds"" was first published in 1921. It is still valid today, and provides valuable lessons to anyone attempting to achieve financial success.You may also want to read ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill and ""The 17 Principles of Creating Wealth"" by Phillip Collinsowrth.",1

"This is probably my favorite novel of all time, and one of the few which I read regularly.  While some might describe this as a no-nonsense Western, I disagree.  It completely transcends the genre in the same way and with the same purpose as _High Noon_.  In fact, I would call it the inverse of that story, for it is really about the cost of cowardice instead of the rewards of courage.  Sadly, the central character is no Gary Cooper.  This book contains larger truths about our frailness in the face of danger and, more importantly, the repercussions which follow the fear and pain into other generations and places.  What happens can easily be extrapolated into other circumstances which happen to everyone everywhere.  I recommend that this book be read for it's enthralling narrative and be appreciated for its universal theme.",1

"So now we've come up with a ""special"" label for kids who need some extra effort on our part to raise?I have 3 ADD kids. I've taught in schools - elementary, middle and high school. Kids who are indulged and taught to think that they are not responsible for their behavior, and that everything they do is wonderful usually do not respond well to authority. The notion that they are more ""evolved"" is ridiculous. They are the product of our instant gratification, ""we're all winners"" age. My kids have turned out to be decent, responsible people who do respect authority. At the same time they have learned to think for themselves and not be automatons. This required a lot of effort on my part and theirs. Giving them a label that explains away less than desirable behavior would have done them no good.Put in the time and effort, don't be afraid of saying ""no"" and being perceived as the bad guy on occcasion. Set limits and follow up. Our kids don't need us to be best friends with them, but they do need loving limits and structure and consistency. The kids I've met who meet all the criteria without fail have parents who think their kids can do no wrong. They are usually very well off and have not a clue on how to effectively parent. The person who invented this ""Indigo"" label deserves a prize for creative writing and duping the public.Sorry, but I'm not buying it. Even my 16 year old ADD son read an article and some blurbs on ""Indigo Children"" and said, ""What a load of crap!",1
"This book is an excellent resource on early modern culture in England.  As some scholars have pointed out, the ""Renaissance"" in the title is a bit vague; this book is concerned with England and its relationship with clothing.  The book is equally valuable for art historians, literary scholars, and theatre work.  The various chapters focus on one or two ways in which clothes affected the English cultural scene.  I have found this book invaluable as I continue working on a research project that involves representations of individuals in art and society, and the more general topic of visual and textual intersections in English society",1
"Both authors are from the esteemed McKinsey & Company.  Even though released in 1997, this book has pretty much mapped out where we are now, and possibly to where the web will evolve regarding Virtual Communities.  A community is started with an initial investment - a learning curve investment - then receives the positve network effects.  The web is used for three basic purposes, to find content, to interact and to complete transactions.  They discuss the 'critical mass' of memebers that a community must acheive before it becomes self-sustaining.  They project a curve of this new web envirinoment of villages, constellations, coalitions, to finally infomediaries (a state yet to be achieved).  There are four factors of initial growth: the size of the potential community, the value of being online, the intensity of commerce, and the fractal depth of the community.  The fractal depth is the number of possible sub-communities that can be developed through time.Consumer-based communites are either geographical, demographic or topical.  Business-focused communites are either vertical (same industry), functional, geographical, or in a particular business category that meets the needs of other businesses.  The authors discuss the virtues of each of these.A fast start-up would be aided by a strong brand name, established customer relationships, or content to keep browsers interested.  Skills to get and retain members are key.The first emphasis is on generating traffic, then concentrating traffic - convincing the browsers to spend time there - you must always be expanding the offerings and creating excitement through participation.  One must then lock-in traffic.  This can be done by fostering a relationship between members, improving community functions, and tayloring resources to individual members.  Keep the sub-communities small.  Give them resources to start additional sub-communites.Sounds like they are right on track.  Five Star",1
"Gerri Hill delivers very satisfying romances with every book, and Behind the Pine Curtain is no exception. While the story is somewhat predictable, she delves into serious themes while giving the reader a thoroughly enjoyable read. Hill's character and theme development remain the strengths of her storytelling.In Behind the Pine Curtain, Kay's best friend Jackie returns home after 15 years, when her father dies, to attend his funeral. At 18, Jackie fled Pine Springs Texas after her parents kicked her out when she confessed to being a lesbian. Jackie never looked back, ending all ties with Kay and the rest of Pine Springs, assuming the entire town felt the same way as her parents did. When Jackie come backs, she has to deal with these unresolved feelings, including her childhood crush on her straight friend Kay.The reader gets to know both Kay and Jackie through strong and illuminating dialogue. Jackie's courage and strength are revealed as we are exposed to her past and as she comes to terms with the present. At the same time Kay questions her uneven history with men especially her abusive ex-husband and begins to see Jackie as the solid foundation in her life. While the theme of sexual discovery is one Hill repeats in most of her romances, her expressive and poignant telling prevent the reader from becoming indifferent. Each story captures us anew. In Behind the Pine Curtain, Hill's words envelop us so we become a part of Kay and Jackie's love story. We are totally absorbed, and we cannot help but feel what they experience.While the author can easily give us a rewarding romance filled with angst and heartfelt prose, she takes her novels a step further. In the book the reader is exposed to the devastating effects of being rejected by one's own family, how it can tear apart each family member's lives, and how the hatred can spread beyond the family to others. The contempt that Jackie's mother still holds for her daughter is evident and chilling, and there is no reconciliation in sight for them. Her mother's place in society is more important than her daughter.  But the author balances this rejection with the support Jackie receives from Kay's extended family, and this sharply contrasts with the cruelty shown by her parents.It is often said that if the reader knows what will happen in the romance and how it will end then the novel must be formulaic. If that is the case, then Hill is one of the few authors today that can write ""formulaic"" romances without them appearing prescribed and fixed.  Behind the Pine Curtain is delightful and inspiring. It is a must read for all romance fans.",1
"Way back in the early days of roleplaying games, the fring publishing company known as Judges Guild provided some of the most imaginative and provocative game supplements of their time.  Gaming has come a long way since then.  Dungeons and Dragons has undergone a mighty facelift.  Would the new, revived JG be up to the challenge of the state-of-the art?You bet they are!  The Player's Guide to the Wilderlands represents much of what got people like me hooked on fantasy games in the first place:  vast, unexplored wildernesses, exotic cities with strange denizens, mossy ruins of vanished civilizations, and just a little humor to keep things edgy.  Production values, once the weak point of JG products, have been brought up to contemporary standards.  The regional map is gorgeous.The book contains background and game information on the Wilderlands, including a rough sketch of major cities (plus a more detailed look at the City State of teh Invincible Overlord), details on the exotic races of the Wilderlands (Amazons!  Blue Skinned Avalonians!  Hawk-men!  All available as PC races!), a listing of many of the Wilderlands' gods and religions, a brief history, and a geographical gazetteer.If you are tired of the Forgotten realms, are no longer frightened by Ravenloft, and seek an alternative to Greyhawk, go forward to gaming's past.  Give teh Wilderlands a shot. ",1
"If it were not for the many sexual innuendos in these movies, I would have rated them maybe a 3 because I do enjoy some satire.  But I wanted to draw attention that these movies have similar adult humor as in the Simpsons cartoon and Saturday Nite Live....so buyer beware.  These movies are not rated professionally but the content should be described on Amazon as to what may be offensive to some.  I bought this collection because of 2 reviews on Amazon that said these were clean and innocent enough for kids. Although one did say in the title that not all the Thumb movies were OK for children.  I didn't see that person's headline or 1 star..only that they put in their review ""innocent enough for children"".  I goofed and listened to those reviews.  I wish I hadn't.  If only I could have rented it first but I couldn't find it to rent.  Our kids love the Star Wars movies so I thought Thumb Wars and the other thumb movies would be funny to watch together as a family.  Sure they're somewhat funny but I wasn't laughing hysterically and we ""all"" were caught off guard by the sexual innuendos.  I'm only going to list their real characters because I forgot their humorous thumb names.  Case in point:  1 scene has the Obiwan and Luke thumb characters getting down on the floor and looking up the dress of the hologram of Princess Leah.  Another scene has Obiwan telling Luke to make sure he doesn't have any girl clothes on underneath his own clothes?  Oh yeah...then there's the scene when Obiwan wants to seal a deal with Luke and asks that they touch their tongues together (which doesn't actually happen, thank God)....and another, where R2D2 and C3PO are getting intimate with each other before someone interrupts them when entering the room.  I'm sure there was more.  We didn't even finish watching that movie.  Our 15 year old had enough sense to walk out of the room. If this is the kind of humor that you want your kids to see, I'm sure you'll love it.  As for me, I'm going to try and return the collection or throw it out.  Think twice before wasting your hard earned money on them!    ",0
"I love this album.  It's a great combination of heartache and rock and roll.  The songs are diverse and the musicianship is fantastic.  When I listen to the album, I'm struck by its fluctuation to and from influences like Dylan, Gram Parsons and Paul Westerberg from one song to the next.  Give it a listen",0
"The first time I heard Queen Latifah sing standards was on the movie Laughing On the Outside and was blown away at the Rap Artist being able to sing standards so when The Dana Owens album came out, I had to buy it.....I play it all the time.

An album one can play from start to finish.I love artists that are able to redefine themselves, she is just that artist",0
"Very few literal endeavors can be placed on the same scope as The Tale of Genji.  Regarded as the first ""true"" novel ever written (in Japan's Heian era) and admittedly, one that has stood the testament of time and the effect it can have on the mercurial minds of readers taste.  After you get over the overwhelming length of the book, you are greeted with a novel that incorporates the subtle beauty of Japanese prose, superstitions and intricacies of that period, an ambitious romantic in Genji, who's epic sense of love can be compared to Casanova.  Born into the highest echelon of society and revered for his unnatual beauty, Genji suffers a fulfilling yet tragic, childhood.  These happenings undoubtedly led to his behavior which spans a multitude of women, illegitimate children, and a *spoiler* tragic death.  The book can be complex at times with the prolific metaphors that are casual only to those of East Asia at this times (such as the common reference to the purple lotus).  The beautiful poetry can be abstract to those who aren't familiar with Heian era prose and the story itself in this translation, can be inconsistent and ""downplayed"" at times that belies the integrity of the original Japanese source.  I enjoyed the book however.  It'd be hard to recommend to most people since most wouldn't have the aptitude to read a book of this caliber.  It is irrefutable that this book is a classic and one of the best of all time.(Hope you liked it Mrs. Atcher",1

"The below reviewer who said Reba took a shot at ""real musicians"" is crazy!Reba is AMAZING.  I don't bash the Dixie Chicks, I own one album- but I would hardly even put them in the same category as reba.  She is a legend in an over produced music industry.  Listen to her VOICE.  She is amazing and sings with passion.  How could you even say she belongs in a convienience store behind the counter? She clearly belongs in the music industry.  She knows real country and she knows how to rock an audience. Stupid review.",0
"I once stated that the further you get away from AA, the worse the  12-steps are in new groups (CoDA, OA, and so on). This book and this  organization were created for people with psychiatric illnesses who have   chemical or alcohol abuse at the same time. I told my therapist more than  once, &quot;Look it. I do NOT want to be in a group with crazy people who  have heroin needles hanging from their arms!&quot; He replied mildly,  &quot;I don't think that will happen.&quot; Just the opposite happened!  There WERE schizophrenics and hard drug users (especially cocaine)there.  But they were REALLY nice, well-dressed, and honest. Wonderful people.  These were DRA people. And this book is our handbook. DRA believes that the  BIG BLUE book of AA states that it is alright to take psychiatric  medication. I don't know about that. But  this book is a gem. It states the  entire format of DRA. Maybe I shouldn't say this. But just between you and  me, the members of DRA seem to be members of AA as well. I'm doing both. I  have been 101 days without alcohol. How did I do it? My psychiatrist looked  me straight in the eye and told me that the combination of Valium (I'm a  Valium addict) and booze will turn my brain into mush. I REALLY hate him.  But he may have helped me more than anyone. He suggested DRA. So did my  therapist. But I fell for the cognitive therapy bit so much (SMART, RR. and  so many other &quot;test tube&quot; semanticists). My psyciatrist said that  I'm an &quot;alche who takes 'goof balls'&quot;. And that he would quit on  me if I drank again. This book and the Big Blue Book are absoluely  essential for people who have psychiatric disorders (I have major  depression) and chemical dependency. Don't go the Albert Ellis and Jack  Trimpey route. Thinking doesn't cause one to be depressed or to drink. It  can be the death of a spose, trouble with one's job, or just a feeling of  hopelessness. Follow AA and DRA and get well. Avoid CBT and RET because  they sell. Thank you. And thank you Dr. Carraway. You were very tough. But  it did work. BUY THIS BOOK",1
"Before you jump on some revisionist books about Pearl Harbor, like Stinnet's Day of Deceipt, you should get it from the horses mouth! Layton, et al, tell a little known side of the war in the pacific. His opinions of some famous naval personalities like Stark and R.K. Turner will really have you thinking about how war is run when powerful, ambitious officers are running the show. It's a shame that lives had to be wasted while the U.S. got its act together to finally win the war in the pacific, but Layton's tale will give you a new perspective and supports much of what was previously written, like Prang's &quot;At Dawn We Slept&quot;, about the debacle of Pearl Harbor and the genius that followed at Midway.

"I just finished reading this book and it ranks high on my list as one of the best reads ever on the subject of what it means to be the church and Christ followers in a changing culture. Awesome! And I've read many books over the last few years on the topic of faith and the church in the midst of an emerging, postmoden cullture. I've also been an avid student for anything related to house/simple churches for a dozen years or so. The Campbells do a wonderful job resisting the temptation of arguing forms, and pay more attention to what it means to be a follower of Jesus in the present that opens the way to transformation and kingdom living",1

"Edges of the Lord received very little publicity when it was released, and the American release went straight to DVD.  Yet this is a film that demands watching and more than once.  Haley Joel Osment gives possibly his best performance ever, and that says a lot considering his outstanding efforts in The Sixth Sense, Pay It Forward, A.I., and Second Hand Lions.  He portrays a young Jewish boy in Poland during the Nazi occupation, who is sent to live with a Catholic family in rural Poland, where he must pose as a Catholic in order to survive.  The only person, besides the family he is living with, who knows his true identity, is the village priest played by William Dafoe who gives an understated yet excellent performance.  The drama is intense throughout, but it builds to an even more intense climax.  All of the children in the movie give remarkable performances which further serve to show the true nature of what it was like to live under Nazi occupation whether a Jew or a Christian. This is a movie not to be missed, and it is a movie that should be watched together by families with children above age 1",0

Yeah, one can hear the influence of Radio Head or Muse, however these guys' expand and explore their own stuff with great courage.

All the songs grow on you and have lasting power like anything of quality does.Already, I can't wait for the next album",0
"John Christopher writes exciting sci fi novels about catastrophic shifts in the world order. He has tackled everything from mass starvation (The Death Of Grass) to epic changes in the earth's weather (The Long Winter) to alien invasions(The Tripod trilogy) to giant earthquakes, which is the central catastrophe of this book.After an enormous series of cataclysmic earthquakes wipes out modern civilization, a group of survivors struggle to stay alive in the ruins of the British Isles.This is one of John Christophers most gripping adventure stories, filled with strange settings and memorable characters;I especially liked the image of the oil tanker beached on the bottom of the now dry English Channel, its sole occupant slowly going mad.",1

"I picked up this novel when a couple of friends recommended it.  Usually I am wary of first-time authors that I have not heard of, especially when you are paying for the hardcover!It ended up being the best money I've spent towards entertainment lately. Philip Donlay's fully formed characters and plot meshed together to create a debut that is certain to make other authors in the genre very nervous.I would compare this book to works by Michael Crichton. It is full of interesting science and aviation details that adds to a unique and credible story line. The last few chapters were extremely intense - don't pick this book up late at night",1
"It's fascinating to hear a band address themes of aging and sexual longing in a youth-obsessed culture, in terms of the withering knowledge that sexual desire does not decrease as one reaches mid-life and beyond.  The ability to fulfill that desire, at will, is another thing entirely.The resulting, bewildered frustration is brilliantly captured in the Grinderman sound: it's the noise of longing, of sorrow, of powerlessness, of an animal shrieking for release from a cage with no gate.  It's also about finding humor, passion, and self-effacing acceptance of all that life has to offer - of refusing to be crushed under the gravity of encroaching age and jaded experience.  That would be too predictable.To put this all in context --In a recent interview with Salon.com (April 12, 2007), Nick Cave said that, as one gets older, one becomes more invisible, and therefore, more powerless, to impact the world.  On some level, he was observing that the inevitability of social and physical death are demons we must confront as we turn the corner on our 40s and smack into the hard brick wall of 50.  On the other side of that wall is liberation, i.e., the freedom to re-invent onself and to remake the rules of the game.  To please oneself.That's the lesson to be learned from Nick Cave and the Grinderman songs.Give this record a serious listen.  Please don't try and compare it to The Birthday Party sound.  This music is immediate and unique.  It is Nick Cave, as he is, now.  It is meant for all of us, still-rocking, still-lusting, still wildly alive, `invisibles' -- as we are, now",0
"I have only 2 minute, very small complaints about this album and then I'll launch into my cheerleading section in which I'll praise it as an early candidate for album of the year and that any reggae collection would be complete without it and it's 2 predecessors. The first of my minute complaints is that you might not get the impression from the cover alone that this is, in fact, a greatest hits compilation of the artist, Jah Cure. It's set pretty much like a regular studio album and although the cover does very well in showing you exactly whats going on with the Cure, it doesn't flatly tell you that this is a greatest hits album, and it should, in case you don't know that. The second even smaller complaint that I have about this one is that its sans Jah Cure's current massive hit Longing For on the wicked Drop Leaf riddim. A great big feather in the cap of VP would have been the gathering of that tune for this album.Okay, now besides those 2 points, if you are a lukewarm fan of roots reggae, reggae, r&b, opera, folk, elevator music or even if you just occasionally enjoy the sound of a fan blowing, you need this album. The collector who has already bought Cure's first 2 album will buy this one anyway (I submit exhibit A for your approval. . . ME) and will be happy to find 5 songs which appeared on neither Free Jah's Cure or Ghetto Life, even though you'll have heard Good Morning Jah Jah althrough by now. The best of the new songs is probably Hi Hi with the heavy heavy Binghi drum backing it, it ascends into becoming a beautifully done African chant at it's completion. The slow winding sound of Troddin the Valley becomes addictive after a very short while and the familiarity of the riddim of Love is the Only Solution feels wonderfully simple and humble but in a great way. The other 'new' song, Give It to Them, sounds straight out of Tuff Gong and straight brilliant.This album, oddly enough, draws mostly from Cure's first album Free Jah's Cure, and not VP's own Ghetto Life (which is probably the best album I've heard in about 10 years). Besides the 5 tracks I mentioned, the intro, and King in the Jungle with Kalonji the other 10 tracks are present on that album. And I'm not complaining, you can't go wrong with any track here, but probably the best of the more familiar material is Jah Bless Me. Also love Chant with Spectacular, Songs of Freedom and Sunny Day, but as I said, they're all great.Overall, you have to throw biggups to VP for putting this one together. The beautifully packaged and well presented piece with the dove flying away on the backg is sure to attract fans who normally wouldn't purchase such a piece. And hopefully the artist, who is now entering his 6th year of incarceration for a crime which he and so many steadfastly claim he did not commit, will benefit from it. Freedom Blues is HUGE",0
"I found the book very easy to follow, and the principles and concepts were down-to-earth. The author gives a no-nonsense approach in performance appraisals, using common-sense and throws out all the other HR mumbo-jumbo. He also lays out a good argument for tying the PA to the company's objectives and missions, ideas on employee motivation (forget the ""employee of the month"" ideas), how to deal with difficult reviewees (those who just don't understand how their performance is bad), and the best way to handle performance planning meetings at the beginning of the year and the importance of these",1

"I believe this book would be worth the price if it was just a pamphlet on how to do your own alignment. And on this point it does an excellent job of explaining the process to a shadetree mechanic. It explains in detail, step by step, how to measure and set up a four wheel alignment, as well as how to check your chassis for square. You will be able to set camber and toe at all four wheels using simple tools. I bought a camber guage from Racer Wholesale to confirm the settings but you will only need masons string or fishing line, a jack, a carpenters tape measurer and the patience to follow directions and measure with extreme exactness. The rest of the book is excellent reading too, especially for 70's hot rodding and sports car modifications. A very handy reference that comes off my shelf quite often",1

"Whichever path through this masterpiece you take, you will need to keep reminding yourself that you entered the land of the brave and you need to go through things that may be too recognizable to accept without resistance. But when you do, it will make you a better person. Then, you may need to be brave enough to forget the part of what you read if you start recognizing too many rationalizations in your everyday walk and talk of life.This work has amazing composition that allows you to read it in different ways. You can skip the whole Part I, if you don't have time and you know that Fromm knows what is he attacking and why, and you can skip big case studies, if you don't have time and don't particularly care for the brains of Stalin and Hitler :-). And still you will get the whole and earth-shattering definition of the human nature and how and why a human can get hurt so easily and can hurt others so easily.Or, you can start with big case studies, if that is what motivates you to read, and in order to read through them you will have to read the rest, probably with your own pattern of chapters.Or, you can start from the page one, to see how deeply wrong currently popular behavioral theory is and take it from there in a linear fashion.",1
"There's history here... I bought the Violence demo directly from guitarist Phil Demmel way back in 1986, and after a few listens, I couldn't wait for them to get a record deal (like seemingly every other Bay Area band back then).  Besides the four-song demo and a track on ""Eastern Front: Live at Ruthie's Inn,"" I had to make do until the Mechanic Records release of ""Eternal Nightmare.""  It seemed an ""eternal"" wait, but it was worth it.  The album is a jet-fueled barrage of aggression from start-to-stop.  Galloping, crunching riffs, frenzied solos, blasting double-bass drums, and Sean Killian's voice.  Despite its detractors, his vocals fit the mood and material perfectly.  Killian shreds.  He wasn't crooning for John Tesh, kids -- this is freakin' Vio-lence, okay?  The title track provides a powerful opening wallop upside the skull.  Check out the brief burst of solo bass, the frantic guitar solo, the gang vocals with ""I'm falling!""  A perfect thrash song.  The rest of the album follows suit.  The much beloved Bay Area thrash staple of gang vocals abound on ""Kill On Command"" and ""Bodies on Bodies.""  The lyrics are well-crafted and, appropriately, delve into dark subject matter - hitmen, serial killers, drug addiciton, the destructive delusion of insomnia.  The one negative doesn't even concern the album itself, but the band did not include the amazing demo song ""Paraplegic.""  When I saw them live on the ""V.T.V. Tour"" they had lost a bass drum when it becamse dislodged from their van.  Despite the lack of double-bass pounding, it was a fantastic show.""Eternal Nightmare"" is a masterpiece of '80s metal in general, and the Bay Area thrash scene in particular.  It easily stands alongside Testament's ""The Legacy,"" Heathen's ""Breaking the Silence,"" ""The Ultra-Violence"" by Death Angel, and ""Fabulous Disaster"" by Exodus as a classic that puts most contemporary pretenders to the thrash metal throne to shame",0

"This CD is a wonderfully eclectic collection of some of the best stories of NPR. A ""driveway moment"" is when there is something so compelling on the radio that you sit in your driveway, listening, rather than leave the car.That's exactly what happened to me when I heard ""My So-Called Lungs."" It's indescribably touching, and I was left with tears streaming down my face, in awe of how the young girl making this audio diary could be so brave. The stories span an almost unbelievable arc of emotion, from the drama of the story I just mentioned, to David Sedaris's Santaland Diaries, which is so hilarious that it's commonly played every Christmas on NPR stations across the country.This is a suberb CD. Listen to it on a long road trip, and I guarantee the miles will just fly by, you'll be so absorbed in these stories.

"What bothered me most about this book wasn't the horrible things the main character experienced, for any book worth its weight in paper usually has all sorts of horrible things happen to its protagonist - but the fact that Mokie is at best a tragic victim. She never rises above her circumstances; indeed she spends much of the book feeling sorry for herself. Readers want a protagonist they can identify with, somebody who makes the best of a situation and tells her enemies how wrong they are. Instead Mokie just wallows in self pity. Just thinking about this book makes me cringe - please do yourself a favor and don't read it if you don't want to be sick",1

The handles are sewn and reinforced and are certainly strong enough if you are storing wreaths or comforters but I would hesitate to carry the bag by the handles if used to store books, heavy toys or sports equipment. I bought on sale but they are certainly worth considerably more and I will purchase more of these rather than the Rubbermaid bins. Great for carting things back and forth to a summer cottage, to college or camp. These bags are much larger than expected even though I looked at the measuremnts. To me that's a plus",0

I just recently won a 26 person tournament using his strategies while I was the short stack at one of the tables. Balance Slansky with Harrington to expand your game.  Sidenote: Slansky made the final table at the 2006 Borgata Open, so tight play can get you in the money.",1
My three children and I read this book over the summer.  This is truly a story for all ages.  My 10-year-old was as enchanted as his little sister and brother.  The story has surprising twists and the most gorgeous illustrations imaginable.  I plan to purchase a copy for our home library.  It's a book you'll go back to again and again.  And with us it sparked some interesting conversations:  What would you put in YOUR fully belly bowl,1
"Born in 1873, John McGraw grew up brawling and playing baseball like he was brawling. And he was very good at it. As the scrappy third baseman and manager of the Baltimore Orioles in the 1890s, he gained fame and not a little fortune as an innovative, autocratic field manager whose teams clawed and fought to championship after championship. His teams represented the epitome of the ""dead ball era"" of baseball, where speed, defense, and aggressive play on the base paths carried the day. He is credited with inventing the ""suicide squeeze"" and the ""Baltimore chop."" He moved from Baltimore to New York in 1902 and during 31 years leading the New York Giants, he won 10 pennants and three World Series. Additionally, under his direction the Giants finished second 11 times. As a legendary manager, h entered the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937.This is the story told in this superb biography by Ohio University professor Charles C. Alexander, whose baseball biographies of Ty Cobb and Rogers Hornsby rank as some of the best ever in the developing field of serious baseball history. Alexander's study is in-depth, thoughtful, and engaging. It is a superb work. Enjoy",1
"Rutger Hauer did a superb job in all areas of the movie, and I applaud him for his acting efforts in this film, as well as his other acting stints.I enjoyed the movie, it had great continuity, a good film score, and the acting was at times funny and also very serious. I highly recommend this film to any Rutger Hauer fans, as well asthose who enjoy action adventure/martial arts & sword flix",0
My 2-year-old adores this movie and asks for it time and time again.  The adult humor is funny enough to keep adults laughing as well but is still kid-appropriate,0
"Written with well-known author, Cecil Murphy, ""Touchdown Alexander"" is a moving story about trusting God and living in true obedience. No one can argue that Shaun Alexander is a great football player. But in the telling of his story, Shaun shows us that life doesn't need to revolve around career. He is a child of God first, a husband and father second, and the MVP for the Seattle Seahawks third. If your young men are looking for a God-honoring role model in NFL football, this would be a good place to start.Author ofThe Truth abouttCafffeine",1
" I still remember being intimidated by this book when I was in grade school. You see, Asimov was what ""smart people"" read. I also remember the summer that I read the entire trilogy, it was the first time that I was completely immersed in a satisfying, intelligent, alternate reality. Epic, is the only way to describe this opus. Starting in a Galactic Empire that is starting to slip into decline, then on to the monastic settlement of the Foundation and it's mission to preserve the best of the old civilization, then on to the recivilization of the ruins of the old Empire. If I recall correctly, it takes around 1000 years, but without the foundation it would have meant 10 times more chaos and darkness. It is the sense of mission and purpose that holds the whole thing together. And if you like mysteries and surprises, there is the matter of the Second Foundation.... Asimov wrote this when he was pretty young. He still had an unshakable faith that science could accomplish anything. Indeed, he saw a traditional clockwork universe that a sufficiently great mind, like Hari Seldon, could mathematically unlock. Later on in his writing Asimov matured- until he saw the galaxy itself as a living, evolving organism- a grand Gaia hypothesis. One other thing, having grown up in New York, I think young Asimov saw himself as Hari Seldon in seeing a decadent and declining civilisation before anyone else. You know, he may just have been right...",1
I love these mixes from Laguna and The Hills. The music is enjoyable and it's worth every penny to have the songs you like on one album as opposed to having to individually buy each album and spend about 200 dollars. I am glad they made this and can't wait for more seasons to come on so they can put together more mixes. I LOVE Laguna Beach!,0
"Fritz Stern has written a personal but objective account of the transformation of one of the most important countries and cultures in the world through the experience of his highly qualified and cultivated family and relations. Considering what they have suffered as a result of the transformation of Germany through five harrowing experiences into what it is today, a solid founding member of the EU, one has to but admire his capacity to relate a very personal experience almost as if he had not been a living part of the experience",1
"I saw this movie when I was a student of Latin literature and thought it captured the spirt of Plautus's plays brilliantly.  Later, I saw a stage prodction which I liked as well.  But no one can replace Zero Mostel.  He is one of the most naturally funny men in the world.  This is vulgar and bawdy and even corny at times but it is lots of fun.  It is one of my favourite comedy movies of all time. ",0
"This is one of my favorite books of all time.  I had to read it for a class in college, and I will be the first to admit that I was turned off by the cover and the bland title.  I'm glad I was forced to give this book a  chance.  It's an amazing true story of a female doctor in Cairo who is  taken away to a prison for her outspoken ideas.  The governemnt takes her  from her home and forces her to live with several other women with very  differnt backgrounds from one another.  However, the situation causes  Sadaawi to become somewhat of a &quot;leader,&quot; and the women form a  strong and unique friendship.  It's an amazing and beautiful book and also  a fast read - don't pass this up",1
"Wonderful speaches, too bad they were only speaches. Technology seems to be the culprit of our modern day problems, but it also seems to make life so much easier, go figure, what a paradox!!! I think anyone who's looking to say ""I told you so"" regarding our environment, will find the wisdom of the Native Americans very interesting. I see similairities with the Samurai philosophy.",1
"Toby, what were you thinking? Did you really set out to offend over half of your listening audience with this obnoxious song? This song sucks and the only reason I gave it one star was because I was forced to by Amazon.com.We already have seven million women and one million men with anorexia in this country and a total of 10 million people suffer from some form of eating disorders. I wonder how many more will join these ranks because of this song.Incidentally, I USED to be a fan of yours",0
