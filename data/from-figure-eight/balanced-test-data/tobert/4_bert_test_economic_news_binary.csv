"Modest Growth Is Worrisome: Economy Lags Behind Analysts' Predictions .... Two weeks ago, the White House noted that June was the 43rd month of the current economic expansion, that the unemployment rate fell from 7.3 percent in May to 7.1 percent, and that consumer prices actually declined, on average, in the first five months of this year.But last week, chief of staff Donald T. Regan indicated the Reagan administration's actual growing worry over the state of the economy, with congressional and state elections only four months away, by publicly pressing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.The central bank, concerned that the economy has shown no sign of a long-predicted second-half pickup, reduced a key lending rate from 6.5 percent to 6 percent, its lowest level since January 1978.Forecasters in the administration, at the Fed and throughout the private economy have been expecting that the nationUas output of goods and services would be increasing by now at an annual rate of 4 percent, at least. Instead, many of them think growth in the second quarter was at about a 2 percent rate, and the private economists making public predictions are increasingly saying the remainder of the year may not be much better.During the last two years, the economy has had exactly the same problem: growth has been only half as fast as predicted, 2 percent instead of 4 percent.",1,1,0.3115,0.6885
"Economic Signals Point to a 2013 Recession; The latest numbers for durable goods and personal income send an alarming message. Will it be heard?. Data released this week by the Commerce Department waved bright red recession flags--orders for durable goods fell 13.2% in August and inflation-adjusted personal income fell 0.3%. President Obama is asking for more time to allow the lackluster recovery to pick up steam. His plan is to move the economy ""forward"" by keeping the current policy framework in place and adding higher tax rates on income and capital gains. But the new Commerce Department numbers, combined with his stay-the-course approach, point to recession in 2013.This administration's economic policy is built on deficit spending, government control over the economy and dependence on the Federal Reserve to buy the government's excess debt. These policies aren't working. They discourage private investment and jobs, and the policies have resulted in high unemployment, weak business confidence and rapidly declining median incomes.The signature of our times is the fever for investing in government bonds and $1,700-an-ounce gold rather than in job creation and small businesses. That is the market's response to Obama administration efforts to reverse core American principles of growth and prosperity.These principles include a sound dollar to provide price stability and to attract capital; a commitment to limited government as a prerequisite for higher living standards; a preference for low tax rates to encourage investment and hiring; and a belief that markets can set prices and allocate capital better than governments.The administration will have spent more than $14 trillion in just four years and added $6 trillion to the national debt. The Federal Reserve has dramatically expanded its role in the economy and markets, practically creating a new branch of government. Its near-zero interest-rate policy favors government, the world's biggest borrower, at the expense of private-sector savers. The Fed's heavily leveraged purchases of government bonds work against the market-based allocation of capital that is a key driver of economic growth. The Fed has now promised to make unlimited future purchases of government debt if job growth remains weak, an affront to the principle of limited government.",1,1,0.0,1.0

"Housing Starts Tumbled 2.2% In September --- Recent Negative Reports Aren't Regarded as Sign Of Return to Recession. WASHINGTON -- A sharp drop in September housing starts capped off a week of ominous economic news.Housing starts dropped 2.2% last month, the Commerce Department said, joining earlier reports of falling exports, stalling industrial production and a surge in consumer prices.In addition to September's drop in housing starts, revised figures scaled back the increases that were originally reported for July and August.""This really is a bad package of news, there's no question about it,"" said David Seiders, chief economist with the National Association of Home Builders.Still, despite all the recent reports, many economists predict the recovery will continue to limp along. The drop in housing starts isn't the start of a recurring recession, but rather a temporary plateau, said Martin Regalia, chief economist with the National Council of Community Bankers. ""It doesn't really show a fall -- the amount of the drop is well within the range of statistical noise,"" he said.

"Regulators Plan First Steps on Credit Rating. WASHINGTON -- U.S. financial regulators this week will take their first steps to replace private credit ratings in their review of bank capital levels, a big step for regulators eager to ensure they are able to accurately assess firms' financial condition.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on Tuesday will lay out a number of options to the use of credit ratings in capital evaluations, part of a joint effort with the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies. Among the options being discussed is a greater use of credit spreads, having supervisors develop their own risk metrics and a reliance on existing internal models, say people familiar with the matter.Agency officials aren't expected to endorse a particular approach and instead plan to encourage input from banks, academics and other regulators. ""It's very difficult to come up with a perfect substitute,"" a person familiar with the situation said, noting that regulators have been using credit ratings for decades.""We have to be very explicit if we're going to take external ratings out, we're going to have to put something extremely specific in."" This person added that some combination of measures could be used.The move is required under the recently passed Dodd-Frank financial legislation, which gives regulators a year to review the use of private credit ratings and then calls for private credit ratings to be replaced.The FDIC's move marks one of the first big rule-writing steps by regulators under the new legislation, part of a broader rethinking of capital levels required to be held by banks by regulators who want financial institutions to maintain the cushion necessary to weather market gyrations",0,0,1.0,0.0
"Novo Nordisk Lowers Sales Forecast on Challenges in U.S.; World's Top Insulin Makers Reports 8% Rise in Profit. Novo Nordisk A/S, the world's largest maker of insulin, cut its sales guidance for the full year because of challenges to its U.S. business, even as it reported a greater-than-expected rise in net profit.The Danish drug maker cut its sales-growth guidance in local currencies for the full year to a range of 7% to 10%, from the 8%-to-11% range it gave in January, mainly because of a difficult rebate and contract environment in the U.S. and intensifying competition within the diabetes-treatment field.The company maintained expectations of operating-profit growth of around 10% for the full year.When asked about industry consolidation and Pfizer Inc.'s rebuffed takeover approach for AstraZeneca PLC, Novo's rival in diabetes treatment, Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard said Novo Nordisk was focused on organic growth rather than mergers and acquisitions.""Novo Nordisk has no intentions of participating in the current consolidation in the industry,"" Mr. Brandgaard said on a conference call Thursday.

"Year of the Downhill Racers; In `Tough, Tough' 1994, Local Stocks Produced Few Success Stories. In 1994, the good times for Washington area stocks were short-lived. They lasted only until Feb. 4, the day that the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates. After that, and for the next 11 months, it was all downhill.By the time the turbulent year was over, almost two-thirds of Washington area stocks had lost money. The losses cut across a wide band and hurt financial, retail, biotech, telecommunications and transportation stocks.It also was the kind of year in which the relatively few winners fell into two categories: companies with products or services that were in high demand; and companies that, having faltered financially, were in a turnaround mode.As often happens in periods of market turmoil, the big blue-chip stocks listed in the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index fared somewhat better than the stocks of the hundreds of smaller companies in a business community that extends from Baltimore to Richmond.""It was a bear market and if you look at the Dow and the S&P, it doesn't reflect what happened in the broad market,"" said Prabha S.

The department reported last week that producer prices declined in August for the third month in a row.Energy prices have tugged the inflation rate sharply up and down this year, first raising alarm over possible inflationary spirals and then bringing relief that the worst of inflation may be over.But many economists are still uncertain over the outlook for inflation. ""The good news in a couple of sectors I think should not obscure the fact that inflation continues at unacceptably high levels in a number of key areas,"" said John Godfrey, chief economist of Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla.Still, even excluding energy, consumer prices posted only a mild 0.2% increase in August.

"Unemployment Edges Up but Still Is Low --- Slowing Economy Takes Toll, But Data Show Weather Is Playing a Bigger Role. WASHINGTON -- America's extraordinarily low unemployment rate is beginning to feel pressure from the sharp economic slowdown, but not enough to prove the entire economy has followed manufacturing into recession.The unemployment rate edged up to 4.2% in January, its highest level since September 1999 but only a bit above the near-30-year low of 4% in December, the Department of Labor said Friday. In January, the labor pool expanded faster than the number of new jobs that were created.Payrolls outside of farming jumped 268,000 in January, adjusted for seasonal variation, well above what economists expected, and a big improvement over the tiny increase of 19,000 jobs in December. That increase was revised down sharply from an original estimate of 105,000. The January data suggest that employment, especially in construction where 145,000 jobs were added, had been unusually depressed by bad weather in December.The report was the first comprehensive look at the entire economy for January. Previous reports had found that the industrial sector's decline accelerated during the month, and the payroll report provided further confirmation. Manufacturing jobs sank by 65,000, bringing total losses in that sector to 254,000 since June. But employment in retail trade, government and other services rose 183,000.""It's clear you have a dichotomy between manufacturing and the rest of the economy,"" said Michael Prell, an economic consultant in Arlington, Va., noting that service-sector employment would have been higher but for the loss of jobs at temporary-help agencies, many of which were actually at manufacturing companies.",1,1,0.0,1.0
"U.S. Payrolls Increase More Than Expected: Rise Makes Fed Action On Rates Uncertain. The U.S. economy created 259,000 new payroll jobs last month, a larger-than-expected gain that made it more likely the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates again soon.But Fed action remains uncertain because the economic outlook is particularly murky, and yesterdayUas Labor Department report of a sizable increase in payrolls did little to clarify just how strongly the economy is likely to grow in coming months.The Labor Department also said the nationUas unemployment rate ticked up to 6.1 percent in July, from 6 percent in the prior two months, but it was still well below AprilUas 6.4 percent rate.The continued rapid growth in payrollsUOprivate businesses hired an additional 1.7 million workers in the last six monthsUOis at odds with a series of other recent economic reports pointing to a slowdown in growth from the 4 percent pace since the middle of last year.Stock and bond prices fell yesterday on investorsUa and traders' fears that Fed policy makers would interplct the payroll numbers as a signal that economic growth is still too strong for inflation to remain low, and would decide soon to raise short-term interest rates for the fifth time this year.",1,0,1.0,0.0
"The `Reagan Revolution'. The Reagan Revolution isn't and never was. Yet it remains a standard reference point in Washington political analysis and reporting. Its invention and survival illustrate just how mediocre much political journalism is: simplistic, lacking in historical perspective and often wrong. The first job of journalism is to ""get it right"" - to be accurate. All too often, political reporting doesn't. It amounts to mythmaking.I take as my text for this grumpy thesis two recent articles in powerful publications. Both try to explain President Clinton's troubles and successes in terms of the alleged Reagan Revolution. Both exemplify persisting sins of political journalism, which is often a triumph of slogans over facts. Politics is viewed, as James Reston often wrote, as sport. The object of reporting is to explain who wins, who loses, why and what it means.The trouble is that politics is not just a game - a series of electoral and legislative contests - but also an expression of national habits and values. Unless these are understood, politics can't be adequately reported. Much political commentary ignores this larger context. Consider a front-page ""news analysis"" in the New York Times on Aug. 1. Titled ""Reagan's Curse on Clinton,"" it attributed Clinton's difficulty in passing his budget to ""the Presidency of Ronald Reagan and the political climate he created.""Wrote R. W. Apple Jr., the Times' Washington bureau chief: ""Mr. Reagan successfully argued that government itself was the problem. Most federal programs were bad; taxes were bad; spending was bad... . {The result is that} politicians are terrified to wear that awful label, `tax and spend,' however much their constituents need government money for health care or roads.""Every trend or change must be credited to or blamed on somebody. What's missed are deeper currents in American thinking and society. Reagan didn't create the mood that Apple describes. Americans have always been suspicious of concentrated power, and national government is - for better or worse - now our most powerful institution. Even in 1958, 43 percent of Americans felt that the federal government ""wasted a lot"" of money.",0,1,0.3333,0.6667

"Well-Guarded Elite Ponders World's Division. -- For the past six days, the world's political, academic and business luminaries who gathered in this Swiss mountain resort struggled -- between bites of lobster tail and sips of Louis Roederer champagne -- to comprehend the reasons behind growing populist backlash against globalization.At seminars and panel discussions held in a fortress-like conference center surrounded by armed guards and barbed wire, they were confronted by a staccato burst of statistics depicting the monstrous inequalities of our age: that more than a billion people live on less than $1 a day, that half of humanity has never made or received a phone call and that Manhattan has more Internet connections than all of Africa.But as they descended today from the snowy alpine peaks, there was an air of disappointment among many of the 2,000 participants who were brought together by the World Economic Forum to ponder how to ""Bridge the Divides.""

JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke wasn't expecting he would have to make another speech like the one he will deliver here Friday.A few months ago, the Fed seemed to be on cruise control as the economy healed. Many officials at the central bank hoped they were done with launching complicated programs to spur a sluggish economy. But Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues, once again disappointed by slow growth and small employment gains this year, are formulating another dose of monetary stimulus to be considered at their next policy meeting in mid-September.So when the chairman speaks Friday morning at the central bank's annual retreat here, he must once again address whether there is more the Fed can do to get the economy going and whether it is worth taking chances on controversial new programs. All along he has argued these efforts are worth it and appears likely to stick to that line in his speech.Beyond big issues of the moment -- such as whether the Fed will launch a new bond-buying program -- a broader question looms in Jackson Hole about Mr. Bernanke's legacy. Long after his term as chairman ends in 17 months, will he be remembered as the Fed chief who did too little to combat high unemployment or the one who did too much and unleashed inflation and financial instability with the actions he took? Critics make both arguments.How Mr. Bernanke acts now depends in part on which he sees as the stronger critique. As an academic before joining the Fed, Mr. Bernanke often criticized central bankers for dealing too passively with financial crises and economic malaise. As Fed chief, he has confronted many limitations to the policies he controls.",1,1,0.0,1.0
"Obama's Soak-the-Rich Tax Hikes Won't Work; Income tax revenues have been remarkably stable at 8% of GDP, regardless of tax rates. The way to increase revenue is to grow the economy.. Author: Alan ReynoldsPresident Obama's response to congressional efforts to curb runaway federal spending is to emphasize, once again, his resolve to greatly increase tax rates on married couples whose joint incomes are above $250,000. This insistent desire to raise taxes--which he repeated in a speech yesterday while complaining about ""trillions of dollars in . . . tax cuts that went to every millionaire and billionaire in the country""--is a distraction. It won't solve our nation's fiscal problem.Preliminary estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) project that federal spending under the president's 2012 budget plan would average 23.3% over the coming decade--up from 19.7% in 2007 and 18.2% in 2001.Even if the president could persuade Congress to enact all of his proposed tax increases, in addition to surtaxes already included in ObamaCare, the CBO finds we would still face endless budget deficits averaging 4.8% of GDP.""Federal debt held by the public would double under the President's budget,"" says the CBO, ""growing from $10.4 trillion (69% of GDP) at the end of 2011 to $20.8 trillion (87% of GDP) at the end of 2021, adding $9.5 trillion to the nation's debt from 2012 to 2021.""",1,1,0.3211,0.6789

"Fed Shifts to Worry Over Risk of Slump But Keeps Short-Term Rates Unchanged --- Markets Now Expect Cuts At the End of January As Inflation Fear Fades. WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve promised to throw a life preserver to the U.S., declaring that the risks of ""economic weakness in the foreseeable future"" exceed the risks of inflation. But it left short-term interest rates unchanged.Financial markets now expect the Fed to begin cutting rates at the end of January, and to reduce them at least one-half percentage point by spring.Abandoning its 19-month stance that it was primarily worried about ""inflation pressures,"" Fed officials ended their meeting with a statement saying, ""The drag on demand and profits from rising energy costs, as well as eroding consumer confidence, reports of substantial shortfalls in sales and earnings, and stress in some segments of the financial markets suggest that economic growth may be slowing further.""Although ""some inflation risks persist,"" the Fed added, ""they are diminished by the more-moderate pace of economic activity and by the absence of any indication that longer-term inflation expectations have increased."" In contrast to recent Fed statements, this one included no mention of the inflationary dangers of tight labor markets.Until a report in The Wall Street Journal this week, financial markets had expected the Fed to declare the risks of inflation and recession about equal. Even though the Fed went further than that, financial markets initially were disappointed that rates weren't cut. Stocks, which had been up before the Fed's announcement in the hopes of a rate cut, sank soon thereafter. As investors' concerns about corporate profits grow, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 61.05 to 10584.37, while the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 112.81 to 2511.71, a painful 4.3% drop.",1,1,0.0,1.0
"Pricey Jeans Give Hanmi CEO Leg-Up to the Top Rank of Forecasters. Sung Won Sohn can thank a pair of $250 denim jeans for his top place in The Wall Street Journal's annual U.S. economic-forecasting rankings.Earlier in the year Mr. Sohn, economist and chief executive of Hanmi Financial Corp. in Los Angeles, was visiting a California jeans producer whose executives told him they couldn't keep up with demand for high-priced clothing. He figured ""there must be money out there if people are willing to pay that much"" for bluejeans. The insight -- along with reports from other clients that costs were rising -- led Mr. Sohn, 61 years old, to increase his 2005 projection for inflation and to stick with his call for healthy economic growth in the U.S.The resulting prediction of growth of about 3.8% for the first three quarters and above-trend inflation of about 3.6% left him ahead of the pack when the results were tabulated. U.S. gross domestic product expanded, on average, at a 3.7% annual rate during the first nine months, and, as of November, the consumer-price index was up 3.5% from a year earlier. Most other economists had forecast lower inflation and a little less growth in 2005. (Preliminary estimates of fourth-quarter growth are slated for later in January.)Also among the most accurate were J. Dewey Daane, a retired professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee; Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America in New York; Gail Fosler, chief economist with the Conference Board in New York; and Maria Fiorini Ramirez of MFR Inc., an economic-consulting firm in New York. All five had above-average inflation forecasts, and three of the five had above-average growth forecasts.Many forecasters rely on econometric models to come up with forecasts for economic growth, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates. Mr. Sohn finds a little intuition comes in handy, too. ""I talk to people on the ground,"" he says.",1,1,0.3363,0.6637

"June Trade Gap Of $14.17 Billion Posted by U.S. --- Exports Rose, But Imports Of Oil Products Surged Second Month in a Row. WASHINGTON -- The U.S. recorded a $14.17 billion merchandise trade deficit last month, as exports rose but oil imports surged for the second month in a row, the Commerce Department said.The gap followed a revised May deficit of $13.12 billion. Because there is a delay in reporting import figures, however, Commerce Department statisticians caution against comparing revised figures from one month with preliminary ones from another. The May deficit had been reported as $14.21 billion.For the second consecutive month, the U.S. posted a deficit in agricultural trade, the first such back-to-back deficits since the 1950s, according to an Agriculture Department historian. June's $71.2 million gap followed May's $348.7 million gap.Also, the deficit in manufactured goods swelled in June as exports increased but imports did, too.

"Deciding Whether to Refinance an Adjustable-Rate Mortgage. Q We bought our condominium in August. At that time, interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages were hovering over 10 percent. In order to help us qualify for a mortgage, our lender persuaded us to get an adjustable-rate mortgage, which had an initial interest rate of 7.78 percent. This is adjusted yearly, using a formula of prime rate plus 2 percent, and has a 2 percent cap per year, with a total rate ceiling of 13 percent. Subsequent to closing on our condo, our annual income has increased while the interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages have fallen to around 8 1/2 percent. Consequently, we are considering refinancing our ARM. We know it is generally financially advantageous to refinance a fixed-rate mortgage if the interest rate on the new mortgage is at least 2 percent less than the existing mortgage. Is there such a rule of thumb regarding refinancing of ARMs?A Common sense-mixed with a little gambler's intuition-should be your best test of whether to refinance.It really does not make a difference whether you have an adjustable-rate mortgage or a fixed-rate mortgage when you are considering refinancing. If you have a loan, such as an ARM, which can conceivably go up to 13 percent, you may want to consider locking in a good rate now as a hedge againt future inflation. After all, you don't need much vision to understand that an 8 1/2 percent loan, fixed for 30 years, is better than paying 13 percent on the same loan.Keep in mind that when you refinance, in effect you have to start all over again. You have to have the title researched, obtain a new survey (other than for a condominium), pay points (with each point equal to 1 percent of the loan amount) and other closing costs, and there may even be some additional recording taxes imposed by the jurisdiction where your house is located. Thus, we have the usual rule of thumb that it makes sense to refinance when the rate drops about 2 percent-since you will have some up-front costs to pay when you obtain your refinancing proceeds.Clearly, anyone who has a loan of 10 1/2 percent or higher should give serious thought to refinancing. Rates are now at the lowest level they have been in perhaps 10 years, and no one can guarantee that they will stay this low much longer. If, for example, you have a $100,000 loan at 11 percent, amortized over 30 years, your monthly payment (principal and interest only) is $952.33. If you can refinance this same $100,000 loan and obtain a new 30-year rate at 8.78 percent, the monthly payment is $795.65. This is a savings of $156 a month. However, to obtain this new loan, you will probably have to pay a minimum of three points ($3,000), and perhaps another $1,000 in closing costs. Thus, while you are going to ultimately save $156 per month, it will take you almost 26 months before you break even. To calculate this, take your $4,000 in up-front costs, and divide that by the $156 of monthly savings.",0,0,1.0,0.0
"Job Losses Up Sharply Last Month; Fed Cuts Key Rate Again; Skinner Says Economy `Staggering'.

"News of Slower Economic Growth, Drop In Money Supply Drive Up Bond Prices. NEW YORK -- Bond prices rallied yesterday amid fresh signs of slower economic growth and an unexpected $2.1 billion drop in the nation's money supply.Analysts say these developments increase the chances that the Federal Reserve System will keep its credit policy unchanged. Until recently, many investors had feared that vigorous economic activity and rapid money growth would prompt the Fed to tighten its credit hold and drive up interest rates.The Commerce Department yesterday estimated that the economy is growing at only a 2.1% annual rate this quarter, down from a 4.3% clip in last year's fourth quarter. The department's preliminary, or ""flash,"" estimate was well below the rate of about 4% that many analysts had been expecting.Prices of some Treasury bonds rose almost 3/4 of a point, or nearly $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Most short-term interest rates declined.

"Banks Step Up Lending In Low-Income Areas; Study Finds More Loans Going to Wards 7, 8. District neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River appear to have won the attention of local financial institutions, according to a study released yesterday that shows mortgage lending activity increased between 1988 and 1990 in these predominantly minority and low-income communities.The housing study, funded by the District government, found that despite a dramatic decrease in city-wide mortgage lending over the past three years, lending activity east of the Anacostia was ""remarkably stable.""From 1989 to 1990, overall mortgage lending activity in the city decreased by 18 percent, to $198 million from $243 million, largely because of the local recession.

"President Ties Social Security's Future to Stocks; Market Experts Mostly Bullish On Proposal's Impact on Wall St..

"White House Backs Off Drug Initiative --- Delay in Reduced Payments Expected on Medicines For Cancer, Hemophilia. WASHINGTON -- Facing intense pressure from cancer doctors and some members of Congress, the Clinton administration will put off plans to reduce payments for cancer and hemophilia drugs, officials said.In June, the Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, said that beginning this fall it would reduce overpayments for about 50 drugs, including those used to treat respiratory disease.

About one-third of the 50 drugs are chemotherapy drugs. However, many of the others are used in conjunction with cancer therapy.The agency's decision is a big victory for the cancer doctors, a politically powerful group represented by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Throughout the summer, cancer specialists and patient advocates have mounted an aggressive campaign to derail the payment reductions. The physicians, sometimes accompanied by patients, argued in Congress that they wouldn't be able to afford to administer chemotherapy in their offices if the price cuts went into effect.The doctors concede that Medicare reimbursements for cancer drugs may be inflated, but they say they need the higher reimbursements to offset sharp underpayments for administering chemotherapy.

Mr. Draghi and a majority of his colleagues on the ECB's governing council had pressed ahead with the new package despite opposition from Germany's Bundesbank.However, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Monday cut its growth forecasts for the currency area, now seeing growth of 0.8% in 2014, having projected an expansion of 1.2% in May. The Paris-based research body called on the ECB to launch a program of large-scale asset purchases, including government bonds.The OECD was joined Thursday by the EBRD, which was established in 1991 to help countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union make the transition from centrally planned to market economies. The development bank has in recent months cut its growth forecasts for many of the 34 countries in which it invests, partly because of the conflict in Ukraine, but also because of a slower recovery in the 18 countries that share the euro.""The case for quantitative easing has become compelling to support the still fragile recovery in the eurozone, to which much of the CEB [Central Europe and the Baltics] and SEE [Southeastern Europe] are strongly linked,"" the EBRD said. ""An effective eurozone QE may help lessen the risk of setbacks in the recovery of those regions.""",0,0,0.7049,0.2951
"THE FEDERAL DIARY: A Crucial COLA Test. n apparent White House-congressional budget agreement could mean smaller inflation raises for federal civilian retirees or smaller future pension benefits for* people still on the payroll.""Budget watchers believe that the White House and Republican congressional leaders have reached tentative agreement on a five-year budget to reduce federal retirement costs. If thatUas true, it means that ""onlyU the $6.2 billion in savings proposed by President Clinton will be sought. The dollar amount of those proposed savings may be ""scoredU at $6.8 billion by the Congressional Budget Office.Agreement is good news, up to a point. Earlier, federal unions had predicted that Republicans would pile their own cuts on top of the cuts proposed by the president.Under the White House plan, retirement costs would be reduced three ways: EUCost-of-living adjustments for federal retirees would be delayed from January to April in each of the next five years. The National Association of Retired Federal Employees says such a delay amounts to a 25 percent COLA cut. COLAs for military retirees and people getting Social Security would not be affected.a Payroll deduction contributions to the retirement fund would be increased by half a percent of salary for federal workers.",1,0,0.6671,0.3329

"Fed Cuts Rates in Bid to Boost Economy; Banks Trim Prime but Don't See Demand: Discount Rate Falls to 4.5% as Concern Is Expressed over Crisis of Confidence. WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve made its boldest bid since February to get the economy moving again, cutting two key interest rates.The Fed dropped its discount rate to 4.5% from 5% and cut the federal funds rate to 4.75% from 5%. Together, the moves prompted banks to cut their prime lending rates to 7.5% from 8%. Other interest rates are likely to fall as well.The action followed a meeting Tuesday of the Fed's policy committee, during which officials talked at length about the pessimism that has gripped the U.S. economy, according to some who attended. They noted the sharp drop in consumer confidence in October, as well as the sour attitude of many business executives, including those who sit on the boards of the 12 district Federal Reserve Banks.In response to that crisis of confidence, Fed officials decided to take more dramatic action than usual, to give a psychological kick to the economy. The effect was amplified by the fact that it came just one week after the central bank's previous credit-easing move, when it cut the federal funds rate to 5% from 5.25%.The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge on loans to each other, and broadly influences other shortterm interest rates. The discount rate is the rate the Fed charges on loans to financial institutions, and is important largely for its symbolic value.",1,0,0.7034,0.2966

"U.S. budget defict widened in February. WASHINGTON -- The federal government posted a budget deficit of $44.3 billion in February, wider than the $38.36 billion in red ink a year earlier, the Treasury Department said.But the first five months of fiscal 1996 looked a bit better, with the deficit shrinking to $80.8 billion from $96.1 billion in the same period a year earlier.

"Canada's GDP Rise In 3rd Period Led By Exports to U.S..

"Progress or Peril?; For seven months, The Post has explored what it means to be a black man in America. Two scholars respond to the stories -- and look to the future.. These two themes struck me as I read The Washington Post's ""Being a Black Man"" series. I was impressed with how the young black men profiled in the series acknowledged their plight and assumed responsibility for it. Their unsentimental realism contrasts sharply with the persistent victim arguments of the experts and specialists interviewed for the series, and those of many academics and social scientists, white and black alike, who think they understand black men and the solutions to their problems.The Post's survey found that 60 percent of black men attribute their plight to their own personal failures and attitudes rather than to racism. They do not underplay the persistence of racism in the United States, but they refuse to explain away their troubles by blaming the system.It is heartening to see that young black men, even more than whites, think that to ""blame things on other people"" is not only a false take on reality but a sure way to guarantee failure. The men interviewed repeatedly made the point that viewing the world as a victim can be self-fulfilling. Most telling is Rahsaan Ferguson's account of his father's mantra, ""You are a black boy. That's two things you will always have against you."" This, Rahsaan fortunately came to realize, was terribly disabling advice: ""It kind of brings you down,"" he said. Indeed.Rahsaan's father, nonetheless, can be forgiven for so badly misadvising his son, because his views are consistent with those of most members of the academic and professional community who interpret or work with blacks. Among such professionals, the overwhelming dogma is that blacks are victims and that racism -- personal and institutional -- is the main explanation for their troubles. It is striking that an overwhelming majority of the professional analysts interviewed for the series emphasized victimhood in their explanations.""Even successful black men are victims of this crisis,"" argued Courtland Lee, a University of Maryland professor and former editor of the Journal of African American Men, in one of The Post's articles.

"Fed Dials Back Bond Buying, Keeps a Wary Eye on Growth. Ben Bernanke gave the U.S. economy a nod of approval just a month before he leaves the Federal Reserve, moving the central bank to begin winding down a bond-buying program meant to boost growth with the recovery on firmer footing.The Fed has pulled back its stimulus efforts before, only to restart them when the economy disappointed, and new challenges loom, including a surprising slowdown in inflation. But Mr. Bernanke said in his final news conference as Fed chairman that the economy was getting to a point where it needs less help.""Today's policy actions reflect the [Fed's] assessment that the economy is continuing to make progress, but that it also has much farther to travel before conditions can be judged normal,"" Mr. Bernanke said.After months of wringing their hands about the implications of less Fed stimulus, investors resoundingly approved of the latest action to begin paring the $85 billion-a-month program.

"Stock Market Quarterly Review --- Wall Street's Woe: Securities Underwriting Declined in Third Quarter --- Global Volume Fell 12.6%, Though Terror Attacks Hurt Year-Earlier Performance. A steep stock-market plunge in July, the threat of war with Iraq, a sputtering economy and a series of corporate-accounting scandals all combined to slow the pace of securities underwriting in the third quarter.Global underwriting volume fell 12.6% to $774 billion in the quarter from the third quarter of 2001, which was itself hard hit by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, according to Thomson Financial, which tracks securities transactions.

"City Faces Struggle Over Budget Drained by Social Costs Series: RUNNING ON EMPTY: The District's Troubled Finances Series Number: 1/3. The District of Columbia government is living beyond its means, pursuing an ambitious social agenda and attacking crime at a cost that could force new taxes on city residents or shatter a seven-year record of balanced budgets.Spending in several major agencies is largely uncontrolled because city officials habitually have underestimated the price of their campaign against drug abuse, poverty and other worsening social conditions.The largest and most troubled city agency, the $1 billion Department of Human Services, may have ended fiscal 1988 tens of millions in the red, according to confidential financial records.Those findings are the result of a two-month examination of the city's finances by The Washington Post.

"Trade Deficit Shrinks, Sending Positive Signal --- Merchandise Gap Narrowed In November as Imports Fell More Than Exports. WASHINGTON -- The narrowing of the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in November was one of the few positive signals sent recently by an economy widely believed to be entering a downturn.The trade gap narrowed to $9.7 billion from a revised $10.99 billion in October, according to the Commerce Department. However, just as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait swelled the deficit late last summer by driving oil prices up, the war currently raging in the Middle East could lead to another price surge -- and thus widen the trade gap substantially -- if it lasts more than a few weeks.The trade deficit totaled $94.95 billion from January through November, compared with $102.6 billion for the year-before period. The trade deficit for all of 1989 was $109.4 billion.

Economists attributed the import drop partly to reduced consumer demand amid the economic slowdown. Exports and imports both increased in October, puzzling economists because the economic downturn apparently had begun by then.

"Bond Yields Plunge Amid Falling Rates World-Wide; Declines, Slack Investment By Business Fuel Concerns Over a Global Slowdown. For months, pessimistic bond markets and optimistic central bankers have been in a tug of war over where the world economy is headed. A renewed plunge in long-term interest rates world-wide suggests the pessimists are winning.Government bond yields in the U.S., the euro zone and Asia have all fallen sharply in recent weeks, fed by a diet of disappointing economic data, lackluster business investment and -- in a new development yesterday -- hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon take a break from raising interest rates.The decline in long-term interest rates mystifies central bankers -- even Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. They see creeping inflation risks and a still-robust outlook for the global economy outside of Europe. And they're increasingly concerned that low long-term rates are also fueling an unsustainable surge in housing prices.Prices of 10-year Treasury bonds jumped yesterday and yields, which move in the opposite direction, tumbled to 3.89%, from 4% Tuesday. That's the lowest since March last year, before the first of the Fed's eight quarter-percentage-point interest-rate increases. The drop came after Richard Fisher, new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said that the Fed is in the ""eighth inning"" of raising rates, suggesting he believed an increase by the Fed later this month might be its last. Investors expect the Fed to boost its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 3.25% from 3% at its meeting on June 29 to June 30.Mr. Fisher's comments are at odds with those of other Fed officials who have emphasized that interest rates are still too low to ensure low inflation.

WASHINGTON -- Even as the U.S. trade gap widened in December for the first time in four months, economists said trade is likely to contribute to growth in coming months, as exports continue on an uptrend and oil prices, which surged in December, fall back.Economists have long predicted that as economic demand among top U.S. trading partners caught up with rapid U.S. economic growth, the U.S. trade deficit would shrink.""The wider gap in December does not overturn the view that the deficit has peaked,"" said Nigel Gault, an economist at consulting firm Global Insight.The U.S. deficit in trade of goods and services in December grew 5.3% from the previous month to $61.18 billion, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. That marked the first monthly widening of the deficit since August. The shortfall for all of 2006 grew 6.5% to a high of $763.59 billion. It was the trade deficit's fifth yearly record in a row.The deficit with China, by far the largest U.S. trading partner, also hit a record for the year at $232.55 billion, sparking calls for action from the Democratic-controlled Congress.",1,1,0.3678,0.6322
"SBA sharply boosts its disaster loans to homeowners. When Ahron and Bonnie Kliger's home was damaged by a 1994 earthquake in Northridge, Calif., the Woodland Hills couple expected their homeowners insurance to cover the cost of repairs -- about $90,000. But they wound up in a dispute with their insurance company and had to turn to an unexpected lender: the U.S. Small Business Administration.Best known for guaranteeing small-business loans and offering advice to entrepreneurs, the SBA is sharply increasing its lending to homeowners, such as the Kligers, through its Office of Disaster Assistance. Today, the home-loan portion of the SBA's disaster-loan portfolio exceeds $3.14 billion, more than double its level three years ago. In contrast, the business loans in the portfolio total $3.45 billion, a 47% increase in three years.SBA officials attribute the explosion in home lending to Mother Nature. Since 1993, disasters such as the Northridge earthquake, floods in the Middle West and Hurricane Andrew in Florida have created an unprecedented, concentrated demand for the low-interest loans administered by the SBA. (The interest rates are about 4% annually for business owners and individual borrowers.)In many of the latest disasters, homeowners and renters were hit disproportionately hard, prompting huge waves of lending to individual borrowers, says Bernard Kulik, an SBA associate administrator who oversees the disaster office. After Hurricane Andrew swept through Florida in 1992, nearly 16,000 homeowners and renters there borrowed a total of $252.7 million. Businesses in the state borrowed $217.2 million. One reason for the high homeowner use: ""I would say that businesses pay more attention to insurance than homeowners do,"" Mr. Kulik says.Officials at the agency stress that the loan program isn't a giveaway: It estimates that 35% to 45% of all loan applicants are rejected because of credit problems, failure to provide sufficient information or other reasons. Homeowners generally can borrow no more than $200,000 to restore their homes to original condition. In addition, homeowners and renters can qualify for as much as $40,000 to replace personal property.",0,0,1.0,0.0
"Beware The Year of The Surplus. For the past 15 years, one huge, looming menace has dominated American public policy; the federal deficit Fear of the deficit has deterred Democrats from launching big new programs and Republicans from securing big new tax cuts. Now all that has changed.The deficit which only five years ago amounted to a record $290 biffion, has suddenly disappeared, and Washington is about to become a very different placeUO possibly a more dangerous one. The deficit applied constraints that made major policy changes almost impossible. Incrementalism ruled, and thatUas been a good thing.As the growth of government has slowed, the growth of the private sector has accelerated, and the nation has become more prosperous. In a kind of ironic feedback loop, that prosperity has led to increased tax revenues, which have brought down the deficit and led us to 1998, the Year of the Surplus.And so, in this new Washington, for the the first time since the Vietnam War, thereUas money to spend. Potentially a lot of _ money.

Rates on 30-year mortgages remained almost flat this week as the Federal Reserve said it would keep interest rates near record lows to help the economy recover.The average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 4.98 percent this week, down from 4.99 percent last week, Freddie Mac said Thursday. Last year at this time, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 5.10 percent.Rates are still above the record low of 4.71 percent set in early December.

However, the central bank did say that it remains open to changing the timetable if necessary.The average rate on 15-year, fixed-rate mortgages fell slightly, to 4.39 percent from 4.40 percent.

"S. African Coalition Suffers Serious Rift; De Klerk Nearly Quits Over Amnesty Debate. Deputy President Frederik W. de Klerk said tonight that he was ""viciously insulted"" during a cabinet debate over an amnesty for crimes committed by police and security ministers during the apartheid era of white-minority rule.The dispute over amnesty marks the first real rift in the multi-party and multiracial government that came to power under President Nelson Mandela following South Africa's historic democratic election last April. It was not seen as a coalition-breaker, however, and de Klerk stopped short of threatening to quit the government.Rumors that de Klerk might pull his former ruling National Party out of the cabinet - where it holds a deputy presidency and six of 27 ministries - raced through political and business circles today, setting off a minor tremor on the stock market. But in a speech tonight to a National Party congress, de Klerk said that while he had considered resigning in the face of a dressing down in Wednesday's cabinet meeting by Mandela, he concluded that South Africa's fragile transition to democracy demands that all major parties work together.De Klerk, who was president when Mandela was elected, said he and his party will oppose a cabinet decision that invalidated the controversial amnesty, which was granted under the de Klerk government just before last April's election. He also issued a veiled demand for an apology from Mandela, insisting that the leadership of Mandela's African National Congress ""take appropriate steps, without delay, to remedy the unfair, unjustified and unacceptable attack on our integrity and good faith.""De Klerk and Mandela are expected to meet Friday to try to patch up what has become a badly damaged relationship.",0,1,0.3333,0.6667
"Stimulus Credited for Lifting Economy, But Worries About Unemployment Persist. Half a year after Congress enacted the largest economic stimulus plan in the nation's history, the measure is contributing to what increasingly looks like a budding recovery, analysts say, but significant concern remains about rising unemployment and the initiative's contribution to the federal budget deficit.With the Obama administration under fire for what critics call unrestrained spending and polls showing the American public ambivalent about the impact of the stimulus plan, officials are pushing back, seeking to highlight the role played by their polices in fueling a recovery.Vice President Biden, making what the White House billed as a major speech Thursday, touted the role of the $787 billion stimulus program in lifting the economy.""The Recovery Act has played a significant role in changing the trajectory of our economy and changing the conversation about the economy in this country,"" Biden said in a speech at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. ""Instead of talking about the beginning of a depression, we are talking about the end of a recession.""While some congressional Republicans and others are dubious about the success of the stimulus plan, economists generally agree that the package has played a significant part in stabilizing the economy.

An international economist or investor will claim that the international sentiment toward currencies, trade and the economic outlook in the United States, as seen through the eyes of investors in Frankfurt, Tokyo and London, was the principal determinant of interest rates in 1987.Our heavy dependence on capital from foreign investors to finance both the federal budget deficit and the current account deficit (of which the trade deficit is the largest component) were the underlying factors.The international investor considers opportunity costs in evaluating investment prospects in terms of the premium on U.S. rates over domestic rates. Consequently, faced with larger investment risks in dollar-denominated securities, foreign investors demanded larger-than-usual yields to entice them into owning U.S. bonds.In the United States, the main problems were what to do about the dollarUOwhether to defend it or allow it to move lower in hopes of reversing the trade deficitUOand how to attract foreign capital in order to finance the trade and budget deficits.Initially, the TreasuryUas dollar policy was anchored in the Louvre Accord, in which the Group of Seven industrialized nationsUOthe United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and ItalyUOagreed to support the dollar while the United States made efforts to reduce the budget deficit.",1,1,0.3333,0.6667
"IPOs Heat Up From Slow Spring Start --- Market Is Revived, But Legs Are Shaky. The market for newly public companies is off the critical list, but it isn't exactly ready to run a marathon.Earlier this spring, the market for initial public offerings was virtually on life support. April was the slowest month for newly public companies since January 1995: Only 30 new companies issued stock to the public, raising $1.6 billion, according to Securities Data Co.By contrast, October, the busiest month in recent history, saw 105 companies raise $6.2 billion in initial offerings. Scores of issues that had been expected to price in April or May were postponed, either officially or unofficially, as underwriters hunkered down to wait until small-stock investors' eroding portfolios turned up and they were willing to look at new deals again.That moment seemed to have finally arrived when the small-cap market started to heat up at the tail end of April and investors made headlines again on some hot deals. Now many underwriting firms have bulging pipelines, the result of months of prospecting for IPO candidates rather than executing deals. Securities Data reports that there are 184 deals awaiting execution, for $6.5 billion, a significant increase over earlier in the quarter.But the enthusiasm may be premature. Unlike previous IPO rallies, many of the most talked-about recent deals have been the larger names, such as Hertz, the car-rental spinoff of Ford Motor. Hertz was priced in late April at $24 a share and closed Friday at $34 on the New York Stock Exchange.",0,0,0.6481,0.3519
"For Stocks, a Bummer Year Gets Brighter. This is typically the sweet spot of the year for stocks. The question is whether the 2005 version will feature real sugar or just Sweet'N Low.With surprising frequency, the period from November through early January is the strongest for stocks, often providing the majority of the annual gain. So far, the pattern is repeating this year.From January through October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3%. Since then, it is up 3%, leaving the Dow barely changed this year, off 0.2%. On Friday, the Dow rose 0.4%, producing a gain of 0.8% for the week. The Dow finished at an eight-month high. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq Composite Index, up similar amounts on the day, hit 41/2-year highs.Why year's end is so good for stocks has long been a subject of debate. Some trace it to days when farmers withdrew money to finance a harvest in late summer, then deposited profits afterward. Others point out that many companies, not just retailers, do the bulk of their business and make their largest profits at year's end, as clients buy for the new year. Markets tend to rise ahead of expected January investment of retirement money in stocks. And crude-oil prices have a way of falling at year's end, after the summer driving season, easing inflation fears. That is happening now -- with crude oil down to a five-month low of $56.14 a barrel last week -- and also happened last year.Whatever the reason, a lot of money managers are counting on a 2005 year-end rally to save their portfolios from decline and leave them in the black, looking like heroes to clients.

Taxpayers claimed deductions of $307.1 billion, with interest deductions heading the list at $132.5 billion, or about 43 percent of the total.But more than 85 percent of the interest deductions were on home mortgages. About $7.7 billion was deducted for interest on charge accounts and credit cards and $36.5 billion for UIotherU interest payments, a category not broken down further by the Internal Revenue Service.A breakdown of interest-paid deductions other than for home mortgages is available only through 1982. IRS statistics show an average deduction of about $1,000 for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of $20,000 to $25,000 that year. The average was still only $2,237 for taxpayers in the $50,000 to $75,000 group.Of course, some taxpayers in any income group could be deducting more than $5,000 worth of interest paid other than for home mortgages.

"Hot Topic: Getting Into Harvard. This is the time of year when colleges and universities decide on the Class of 2010.

And it even lets us say something good for a change about Harvard -- and Yale too.Cynics will note that the way to get into elite universities is to be a minority, the child of an alum, have a 4.0 GPA and perfect SAT scores, or be a star quarterback or piccolo player.

"Steady Consumer Confidence May Pay Off for Retailers --- Signs of Rising Jobless Rate Aren't Expected to Stop Holiday Shopping Sprees. WASHINGTON -- With signs that the job market is softening only a bit, consumer confidence remains high heading into the holiday shopping season, giving beleaguered retailers a reason to cheer.The Labor Department said the number of first-time claims for jobless benefits climbed by an unexpectedly large 7,000 last week while a longer-term gauge hit its highest level in nearly two years. The numbers suggest that the jobless rate will increase in coming months.Still, the unemployment picture has yet to take a bite out of consumer's confidence in the economy. The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment actually increased in November, surprising analysts expecting a decline due to stock-market weakness and continuing election uncertainty. The index finished the month at 107.6, nearly two points higher than its 105.8 level in October and only a few points below the record set in January.The report offered a burst of good news for the nation's retailers, who have seen their stock prices battered in recent weeks amid evidence of slackening sales and dire predictions for a relatively weak holiday-shopping season. Most retailers' fortunes rest on the crowds of shoppers who flock to their stores between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day.The new data suggest that such fears may be groundless. ""With the index at these levels, it would still be reasonable to expect robust growth in consumer spending,"" said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.",1,1,0.0,1.0
"IMS Struggles to Regain Trust After Failed Deal. Gaining the confidence of Wall Street can be hard for a company. But regaining the Street's confidence after losing it can be even harder.Take health-care information provider IMS Health. It delivers information on drug sales and trends to pharmaceutical giants, with an amazing 93% market share. But some investors and analysts are reluctant to give the company a clean bill of health because of management-credibility issues.Concerns stem from the odd reverse merger IMS announced this past March with TriZetto, a three-year-old Internet health-care concern with a mere $33 million in annual revenue. Investors couldn't grasp why the venerable information provider -- with $1.4 billion in annual revenue last year -- was looking to merge with the newly public company, which offers medical billing and administrative software online. Amid the pummeling of both companies' shares, the deal was subsequently scratched, although IMS ended up selling a unit to TriZetto.The company's shares have been given a 5% ""management discount"" by Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Stephen DeNelsky. He has prepared an interactive stock-valuation spreadsheet for investors in which they choose how much of a discount they want to apply. ""It's the risk that when you walk in one morning and boot up your machine that there is another news item with something like the TriZetto deal,"" Mr. DeNelsky says of the discount.For their part, IMS's top executives continue to defend the deal, believing it would help IMS to expand its Internet strategy. ""From a strategic point of view, it was a good transaction; from a timing point of view, we couldn't have picked a worst time because we did announce it simultaneous with the collapse of the technology market,"" Robert E. Weissman, the company's chairman, says in an interview, referring to the spring collapse in tech shares. ""We were not tone deaf in spite of the fact that we did not need shareholder approval. We listened and we modified the transaction.""",0,0,1.0,0.0
"Budget Talks Now Are Close To Agreement --- Accord Between Congress, Bush on Cutting Deficit Could Come Late Today. WASHINGTON -- After four months of unproductive talks, White House and congressional budget negotiators finally narrowed their differences and say they could reach a deficit-reduction compromise by late today or tomorrow morning.""I have been pleased with recent progress, although it has not always seemed so smooth,"" President Bush said in a televised address to Congress last night.""But with or without an agreement from the budget summit, I ask both houses of Congress to allow a straight up-or-down vote on a complete $500 billion deficit reduction package not later than Sept. 28.""The Republican and Democratic sides are converging on a compromise that would raise taxes about $130 billion net over the next five years -- including an energy tax of some sort, a new tax on luxury goods and higher taxes on alcoholic beverages.Defense spending would be cut between $170 billion and $200 billion from projected levels, based on proposals offered by the two sides. Domestic spending of all sorts would be trimmed between $103 billion and $126 billion, with both sides now proposing to make the elderly pay a bigger share of the cost of the rapidly growing Medicare program. Savings on interest costs would account for the balance of the $500 billion package. Even if negotiators agree to cut the deficit $50 billion for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. and the package is enacted, the federal deficit will still approach $200 billion, the White House budget office estimates. As a result, any pact will have to waive the $64 billion deficit target set by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.",1,1,0.3519,0.6481
"Unequal Opportunity: Losing Ground on the Employment Front --- Losing Ground: In Latest Recession, Only Blacks Suffered Net Employment Loss --- Firms Added Whites, Asians And Hispanics Overall, But They Deny Any Bias --- Effects of Seniority, Location. The last recession seriously eroded equal opportunity for America's black workers.Blacks were the only racial group to suffer a net job loss during the 1990-91 economic downturn, at the companies reporting to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Whites, Hispanics and Asians, meanwhile, gained thousands of jobs, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of EEOC records.The computer-aided study shows that some of the nation's largest corporations shed black employees at the most disproportionate rate. At Dial Corp., for instance, blacks lost 43.6% of the jobs cut, even though they represented 26.3% of Dial's work force going into the recession. At W.R. Grace & Co., they held 32.2% of the jobs cut, while they accounted for 13.1% of the company's pre-recession payroll. At BankAmerica Corp. and ITT Corp., blacks lost jobs at more than twice the rate of their companies' overall work-force reductions.Companies say the sudden demographic shift is a statistical fluke, the unintentional fallout of corporate cutbacks and reorganizations. But some civil-rights advocates argue that something more insidious is going on.""This is subconscious, deep-seated racism,"" says George Fraser, who publishes directories of black professionals. ""People don't even know these patterns and behaviors are being initiated until you begin to see the pieces of the puzzle together and look at the numbers.""",0,1,0.3388,0.6612
"Bond Prices Fall; Stocks End Mixed --- Fed Rate Statement Prompts a Tumble In Dormant Market. A widely expected Federal Reserve increase in short-term rates sent bond prices falling and knocked stock prices down from their highs to mixed levels. The dollar was mixed.The bond market, practically dormant through much of the morning, began churning once the Fed said at midafternoon that it had raised interest rates. But as economists read through the Federal Open Market Committee statement on the move, bond prices began to slump, especially among shorter-term issues.Some economists noted that not only did the Fed increase the federal funds rate by 0.50%, but also the discount rate by the same margin. The fed funds rate is the bank overnight lending rate and the discount rate is the rate the Fed charges from its discount window. In addition to the rate boosts, the Fed termed signs of slowing as ""tentative"" and hinted that the economy remains quite vigorous, even as it raised rates for the seventh time in about one year.The language that accompanied the Fed's move, especially about inflation and capacity utilization, along with the unanimous vote, telegraphed a certain sense of concern to the bond market,"" said Frazier Evans, senior economist for Colonial Investment Services.In the stock market, a mild rally in cyclical issues rapidly escalated into a fierce argument between the two warring constituencies seeking control of the stock market.

"For Some, Sound of Profit Is 'Timber!' --- While Other Investments Wither, Forest Land's Value Keeps Growing. WINCHENDON, Mass. -- Money still grows on trees.Timberland, which a few years ago became a popular investment among institutions and wealthy folks, has held up amid market massacres for most other assets lately.Through Sept. 30, the value of timberland rose 5%. When the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries reports 2008's final quarter this week, this number is unlikely to move much. That marks a slower pace of growth, yet it is growth nonetheless. In 2007, timber appreciation was a towering 15%.How can positive returns exist in these dark days of shrunken prices for everything ranging from real estate to commodities to stocks? Oil, after a summer price spike, was down 54% in 2008, while corn lost 11% and copper 54%. (Gold, as a refuge commodity, rose 6%.) Prices for lumber, a key forest product, have fallen by 34% over the past year as housing construction has ebbed.The answer to this riddle is that timberland is the ultimate long-term investment, with relatively little bought and sold each year -- and demand still respectable for what does change hands.

"Fed mulls lower store fees on debit purchases. The Federal Reserve proposed on Thursday lowering the fees that merchants must pay when shoppers use debit cards, a move that could reduce retail prices but result in higher banking fees for consumers.Under the recommended new rules, the interchange fee, or ""swipe fee,"" on debit cards would be capped at 12 cents - about 70 percent lower than the average fee of 44 cents per transaction last year, according to the Fed. The total amount banks received from debit card interchange fees was $16.2 billion.The move was applauded by retail industry groups and small businesses, which have long said the fees are excessive and they have little power to negotiate them down. Retailers have also said the cost of the fees is second only to labor and is growing faster than health-care expenses. On Thursday, they said the new rules would allow them to deliver significant savings to shoppers.""This is not only good for businesses, but most importantly it's good for consumers,"" said Hank Armour, chief executive of National Association of Convenience Stores. ""There is an abundant amount of evidence cost savings will be passed through.""Interchange rates are set by card processors such as Visa and MasterCard and paid to banks as an incentive to use their networks.

"The Heavy Cost of Continued Inflation. Regardless of any mitigating qualifications that may be read into it, the unemployment of 6 per cent of the national labor force in December is a sobering commentary on the economic transition through which the United States is passing. Undoubtedly it does reflect in part the winding down of the war in Vietnam. In larger measure it is a product of the economic slowdown deliberately brought about to curb an alarming rise in inflation. The specific cause in any particular case will not lessen the distress of jobless families, however, and that distress is now sufficiently widespread to make corrective measures imperative.The classical method of dealing with inflation has always had an ironic twist. The curtailment of economic activity to relieve the upward pressure on prices has exacted sacrifices from those least able to bear them. This time, moreover, the irony has multiplied. While 4.6 million unemployed are tightening their belts because of the scarcity of jobs, millions of other workers are taking advantage of the continued inflation to boost their incomes, with little or no regard for what the general consequences may be.In addition to this special toll exacted from people who lose their jobs, the economic trends of the last year have been rough on a large majority of wage earners. Hourly pay has advanced over the last year by 5.8 per cent, but the cost of living in November was 5.6 per cent above the figure a year ago. In other words, almost the entire increase was eaten up by higher prices, with no allowance for the rise in worker productivity, which is now increasing again.last year. Department of Labor statistics for the first nine months of 1970, the latest available, show UIa mean wage and benefit package adjustment of 10 per cent a year.U The average first-year wage and benefit change during that same period amounted to 14.7 per cent a year. Economists recognize these exorbitant wage increases in some key industries as a leading cause of continued inflation even in the face of lax economic activity.One segment of labor, the unemployed, is taking a severe drubbing from the current economic situation while another, the large powerful unions, is riding the crest of excessive benefits for its own members. The sacrifice imposed on workers at the bottom of the scale for the sake of attaining a stable economy is proving to be ineffective in part because of the extraordinary power exerted by other labor groups at the top of the scale.",1,1,0.3171,0.6829
"Consumer Prices Increased 0.3% In November --- Third-Quarter GNP Rose At 2.5% Annual Rate; Inflation Appears to Ease. WASHINGTON -- Inflation eased a bit in November as consumer prices rose 0.3%, or at a 4.4% annual rate, the Labor Department said.The price report came as the Commerce Department released its final calculation of the country's third-quarter economic growth, confirming that the economy during the period expanded at its slowest pace since the end of 1986.The department estimated that the gross national product, the market value of all the goods and services produced in the U.S., grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 2.5% during the period. The figure was slightly lower than the previous estimate of 2.6%, a revision most economists said was insignificant.On the surface, the two reports seemed to mitigate some fears that the economy is growing too rapidly to hold prices in line. The increase in consumer prices was lower than many analysts expected, and, to most, reinforced a Labor Department report Friday that showed wholesale prices in November rose only 0.3% as well.Moreover, the third-quarter GNP expansion was significantly slower than in the first and second quarters, when GNP grew at 3.4% and 3.0% respectively.",1,1,0.0,1.0

"Tax Increases We Can Live With. Let's keep this tax thing in perspective. Suppose Congress and the White House decide to raise taxes $25 billion. That's less than a 2.5 percent increase in overall federal taxes. Suppose that ultimately another $25 billion is needed to close the budget deficits. The total still represents less than a 5 percent increase. No one likes to pay higher taxes, but these amounts won't impoverish most Americans or cripple the economy.How will we get hit? Higher ""sin"" taxes on cigarettes, beer and liquor seem likely. So are steeper ""user fees"" for, say, airline passengers. The impulse of Democrats and Republicans alike is to construct a package of many small-and highly technical-increases so that no one sees much impact. The budget summit should do better than that.It should not just raise taxes but should do so in a way that makes the overall federal tax system fairer and more efficient. How about a ""carbon tax"": a tax on oil, natural gas and coal? This would depress energy use, air pollution and emissions that contribute to the ""greenhouse effect."" How about taxing capital gains (the profits on the sales of stock or other assets) when people die? Closing this loophole, which benefits mainly the wealthy, could raise at least $2 billion to $3 billion a year.As they go about this political drudgery, the White House and Congress should adhere to three guidelines:First, keep income-tax rates low. A tax system with high rates and many special tax breaks (credits, deductions, income exclusions) invites abuse and waste. Hordes of tax lawyers and accountants are deployed to help people and companies minimize their taxes. Investment decisions are skewed by tax breaks.

"Economy Signals Damage Control; Retail Sales Slow, Trade Deficit Falls. Economists have been predicting that consumers would slow their spending but that the damage would be cushioned as U.S. businesses sold more products abroad. Yesterday, there was evidence that both are starting to happen.The U.S. trade deficit fell to $57.6 billion in August, and major retailers' sales at stores open at least a year rose a meager 1.7 percent in September from a year earlier, two reports said yesterday.Monthly results can be volatile, and economists caution not to read too much into what could turn out to be blips. But taken together, they are indicators of an economy in transition. The weak housing market is making consumers spend their money more carefully. That in turn means that retailers import fewer goods from abroad, lowering the trade deficit.Simultaneously, the slower U.S. economy and lower interest rates mean that the dollar is less valuable compared with other currencies than it was a few months ago. That makes U.S. goods cheaper and exporters more competitive than they have been in recent years, creating a source of growth that will ease the pain of the housing crunch.""Trade is providing a pretty big offset to the drag of housing,"" said Brian A.

"U.S. Budget Deficit Shrank in January To $2.17 Billion. WASHINGTON -- The federal government's budget deficit shrank to $2.17 billion in January from $6.49 billion a year earlier, the Treasury Department said.Last month's gap compared with a revised $11.12 billion deficit in December. Originally, the December figure was estimated at $12.08 billion.January's deficit was the narrowest since $1.01 billion last June, Treasury data show. The Treasury said federal government receipts totaled $81.77 billion in January, compared with $76.70 billion a year earlier. Outlays were $83.94 billion last month, compared with $83.19 billion the year before.George Gould, Treasury undersecretary for finance, told a group of business economists here that during the first four months of fiscal 1987, revenues were $8 billion to $9 billion higher than the amount the Treasury had anticipated. He attributed this in part to tax law changes, including the phasing out of many deductions, that apparently have caused individuals and businesses to increase payments of estimated taxes.At the same time, however, the Commerce Department has said that in January some people were having too little tax withheld from their paychecks because they hadn't accurately readjusted their withholding under the new law. This would tend to lower, rather than boost, revenues. A Treasury spokesman said that at this point there wasn't any readily discernible reason for the increase in receipts from a year ago.",1,1,0.3211,0.6789

Author: Conor DoughertyA key gauge of U.S. inflation has fallen to its lowest level since record-keeping began in 1957, underscoring the continued weakness in the economy.Consumer prices rose 0.2% in October compared with September, almost entirely because of higher energy costs, the Labor Department said Wednesday.When volatile food and energy are subtracted, prices were unchanged last month--the third straight month in which this so-called core measure of inflation was flat.

"Tracking the Economy: November Inflation Rate Is Seen Up 0.4% --- Relatively Flat Rise Belies Belief by Some Of a Speed-up Ahead. NEW YORK -- Consumers, who made their presence felt in last week's retail sales report, find out tomorrow how inflated the bill was when the November consumer price index is released.The CPI, which measures inflation, is expected to have risen 0.4%, about the same as in October. Economists' estimates for November's increase run from 0.2% to 0.5%, according to MMS International, a Redwood City, Calif., firm. Retail sales jumped 1.1% in November, raising concerns that inflation is creeping up to troublesome levels.Even if the CPI comes in flat, some economists think it's only a matter of time before prices leap.

Mr. Sinai figures that the annual rate could speed up to 5.5% to 6% in the not-too-distant future.Food and energy, the CPI's two most volatile components, have been relatively stable recently.

Most brokers supply their screens only to the 35 commercial banks and securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as ""primary dealers,"" as well as another 16 or so firms that are seeking to join the club.Major bond dealers frequently turn to brokers, rather than trading directly with other dealers, because that allows them to trade anonymously.

Having done so, I sidled up to Oliver Gingold, our longtime stock-market watcher who dated back to Charles Dow, and announced I had bought some General Motors. Oliver looked at me with a twinkle in his eye and remarked, ""Maybe you're dumber than the fellow who sold it.""There's a like truism in the banking world, though hardly anybody remembers it. For every borrower there's also a lender.

Sometimes it's hard to figure out which one is dumber, borrower or lender.Take all those farm loans.

"A1 8 MONDAY, APRIL.3, 1978  . AFTER PRESIDENT CARTER gets homo tonight from his trip abroad, lie's going to have to decide quickly what to do about the ominously rising inflation rate. If, that is, he intends to tlo anything serious. Last January, in his economic message. Mr. Carter outlined in rather vague and sketchy terms the beginnings of an attempt to push down the American inflation rate. Since then, the administration's record on inflation has been notable more for the exceptions than for the policy. The administration has newly discovered the old political truth that the world is made up exclusively of people who think that they are special cases. Late last year the inflation rate was a little over 6 percent. Currently it seems to have worked back up to a little over 7 percent.The sad thing about it is that the policy remains, in principle, the right one. It is the strategy of gradual deceleration, to use Mr. CarterUas word. He is not thinking about mandatory wage and price controls, a very dangerous approach. He is not inclined toward-hard-and-fast guidelines, which always tend to become floors rather than ceilings for increases. The president recognizes that it will take time to work the inflation rate down, and the present target is a reduction of half a percentage point a year.But now itUas moving the other way, and the reasons are related to this administrationUas style of politics. It keeps getting itself into embarrassing jams, and it keeps trying to buy its way out by trading off pieces of the inflation strategy. The administration wrings its hands and explains how difficult its political position is on this or that passing question, and the first thing you know thereUas another special exception to the deceleration plan. Consider the most recent example. the steel price increase. Then consider the next one, the coming collision over federal pay raises.By the time the coal minersUa strike started last December, the administration had already accepted the idea that the wage settlement was going to be extremely large. It turned out to be .39 percent over U three years, wildly out of line with deceleration strategy. But the miners were a special case.Then.one special case began to breed others. In its frantic efforts last month to bring the strike to a close, the White House leaned hard on the coal com- panies, and on the steel companies that own coal companies, to give in on certain key points. They gave inUObut there is always a price for that kind of cooperation. Last week, even before all of the miners were back at work, long before any newly mined coal had actually moved, U.S. Steel announced a price increase of $10.50 a ton.

"Employers Lobby to Weaken Insurance Mandate; In Implementing Law, Much Will Ride on the Details; Who Qualifies as a 'Full-Time' Worker?. It is three years before most of the new health-care law kicks in, but already some of America's largest employers are peppering the Internal Revenue Service with concerns that making the changes will be far more complex than they anticipated.At issue is one of the law's central requirements: employers with 50 or more full-time workers must offer affordable insurance or pay a penalty. It sounds simple enough. But in crafting the rules, the IRS and two other federal agencies are now tackling basic yet messy questions, such as who counts as a full-time worker and how do companies measure whether insurance is ""affordable.""In one of more than 200 submissions made recently to the IRS, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Gap Inc., United Parcel Service Inc., Hilton Worldwide Inc. and others have pushed for a lengthy grace period that could stave off penalties for a year or more after certain workers are hired. The result could undermine some of the law's intent to insure those who can't afford coverage.Large employers also have met with White House officials to press their case.Retailers, restaurants and other companies that rely on seasonal, temporary and other workers with flexible schedules, say it's hard to figure out who is a full-time worker. That could cause the employer to enroll and drop them from coverage, potentially churning them through new state-run insurance exchanges or the Medicaid federal-state program for the poor, as their hours fluctuated.Moreover, companies are worried about another standard that requires they offer care that is ""affordable,"" or roughly 9.5% of an employee's household income. The employers say they can't calculate that without asking employees how much their spouses or dependents earn--a potential privacy violation that may not be verifiable, either.",0,0,1.0,0.0

"Terror-Insurance Costs Cut Into Demand --- Large Policy Buyers Choose Limited or No Coverage, Cite Surge in Premiums. Deep into the all-important year-end renewal season for insurance contracts, big insurance buyers in many cases are choosing to either carry no terrorism coverage or opting for low-level coverage, leaving themselves vulnerable in the event of future attacks.The big reason buyers are turning down the specialized coverage, whose value was illustrated by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, is it has become simply too expensive, in many cases costing more than a company's basic commercial coverage.""There is terrorism coverage available, but it's at outrageous prices,"" said Bob Spadaccia, senior vice president for the Northeast at USI Insurance Services Corp., a San Francisco insurance broker. Real-estate companies and any other entities that are required, either by law or, in some cases, by lenders, to buy the terrorism coverage ""are choking on the numbers,"" he said.Prior to the Sept. 11 attacks, which are estimated to be costing the insurance industry at least $40 billion, such terrorism coverage was included as part of a standard policy. Now, terrorism coverage is being stripped out of the policies offered to most large businesses and owners of properties viewed by insurance companies as the likeliest targets, including tall office buildings, sports stadiums and shopping malls. These businesses are being offered the chance to ""buy back"" the coverage, but only at the steep prices. USI estimates only about one in 10 such clients is opting to buy back the coverage.Smaller, lower-profile businesses are less affected by the insurance industry's retrenchment.

"Electric Attraction: For Europe's Utilities, A Frenzied Power Grab; As Deregulation Nears, Bids Top $100 Billion; Will Consumers Benefit?. MADRID -- With more than $100 billion of deals proposed in the past two years, Europe's giant utilities have one of the world's biggest cases of merger mania. Just yesterday two European companies culminated a messy battle and agreed to a $58.27 billion bid for Spain's Endesa SA.Behind all the deals is a big collision between Europe's new push for a unified marketplace and the national pride of Europe's politicians. Starting July 1, the European Union's power sector will be officially flung open to competition, allowing utility companies from any of the bloc's 27 member nations to sell electricity in any other.By unshackling the energy sector, European regulators hoped to boost competition and lay the foundation for stronger growth on the continent. They wanted to inject the continent's electricity marketplace with new players that would spur cheaper energy prices.But that vision has bumped up against a messy reality: Politicians in European capitals are reluctant to loosen their grip on the state- run national champions that dominate strategic sectors. Rather than invest in new capacity, transmission lines and other upgrades, the dominant players have instead been bulking up for a wave of mergers.Big utilities are scrambling to buy up assets from Bulgaria to Scotland in a mad dash to get bigger when the deregulatory rules come into full effect. Last year, Paris rushed a merger between French utility Suez SA and Gaz de France SA, though the pact has hit legal and political hurdles and the outcome is unclear. Earlier this year, two midsize power companies in the Netherlands, Essent NV and Nuon NV, said they would tie the knot.

"What Slowdown?. If the U.S. economy keeps growing like it is, Rodney Dangerfield is going to have to rise from the dead and file a patent claim. The expansion that gets no respect keeps cruising along -- past $70 oil, above rising interest rates, and now apparently around even the housing and auto slumps.Yesterday's report that fourth quarter GDP rose a healthy 3.5% was merely the most recent repudiation of the media and Beltway bears who have predicted a recession in each of the past four years. The latest scare came last fall, as the decline in housing accelerated and many of Wall Street's Keynesian forecasters predicted the consumer would slump along with it. (We hope someone offered smelling salts to the economists at Goldman Sachs yesterday.)To the contrary, the consumer remains confident, clocking in with a strong 4.4% spending growth rate in the quarter. Clearly the strong job market and rising wage levels are offsetting any fear among consumers that their home values have flattened or fallen. Without housing and autos, real GDP rose 5.8%.At the same time, U.S. exports are booming, as growth elsewhere accelerates. Exports rose 10% in the quarter and a very robust 9.2% for the year, adding 1.64 percentage points to GDP growth. By the way, exports to China alone rose by more than 30% in the first 11 months of last year, even without a major change in China's policy to peg the yuan closely to the U.S. dollar. Members of Congress pounded Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson yesterday for not doing enough to get China to revalue the yuan, but maybe China's growing economy is more important for American exporters than devaluing the greenback. Just a thought.The most bullish economists yesterday also hailed the GDP report's inflation signals, which were muted. But we're not convinced the current inflation cycle has played itself out -- not with gold back near $650 an ounce, commodities in general rising again and the dollar weak. For its part, the Federal Reserve held its target fed funds rate at 5.25% yesterday, but played inflation down the middle.

"Fed Looks Likely to Stick to Policy Path; Officials On Track to Cut Bond Buys to $45 Billion, Maintain Rate Flexibility at Next Week's Meeting. Federal Reserve officials are on track to reduce their monthly bond buying to $45 billion at their policy meeting next week and stick with a communications approach that leaves investors guessing about when the central bank will start raising short-term interest rates.""While monetary-policy discussions naturally begin with a baseline outlook, the path of the economy is uncertain, and effective policy must respond to significant unexpected twists and turns the economy may take,"" Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said in a speech at the Economic Club of New York last week, her last comments before the central bank's one-week quiet period ahead of its April 29-30 policy meeting.Her emphasis on uncertainty in the speech underscored a shift in Fed communications early in Ms. Yellen's tenure as chief. For much of the economic recovery, the Fed has tried to provide concrete assurances to investors about the path of short-term interest rates. Officials now are trying to retain some flexibility on the interest-rate outlook as they try to resolve several mysteries about the recovery, which has generated surprisingly slow economic growth, low inflation and faster declines in standard measures of unemployment than expected.""Tying the response of policy to the economy necessarily makes the future course of the federal funds rate uncertain,"" Ms. Yellen said last week, referring to the Fed's benchmark short-term interest rate, which has been near zero since late 2008. Other Fed officials have sounded the same refrain in recent comments.In 2011 and 2012, the Fed's interest-rate assurances came in the form of promises that officials wouldn't raise rates until after certain dates passed.

"How to Rip Up the Region. IT WAS BOUND to happen when the full force of the recession hit the pockets of this regionUas governments, but today there is even more evidence that budget pressures are threatening to destroy Metro, the Council of Governments and other important city-suburban institutions, While some of the effects might not be felt immediately by the public, breakdowns in bus service, higher costs of transportation, delays in road projects and other costly setbacks could occur if disputes between the local governments arenUat resolved soon.E Metro: The Metro board has ordered General Manager Lawrence G. Reuter to cut District bus service and raise fares if the city does not pay the transit agency the $18 million that it owes by Feb. 1. This isn't a new dispute. In fact, the current city administration has been relying on delays in Metro payments to help balance its annual budget booksUOon paper if not in reality. This week, as they have done in the past, the regional board members agreed to allow Mr. Reuter to borrow money to pay Metro's billsUO including its payrollUOuntil the District government pays its full, agreed-upon share, plus interest.If that doesnUat happen, the options Mr. Reuter is considering are shutting down night and weekend bus service in the District; eliminating any bus routes that duplicate rail routes; ending discount fares for schoolchildren; raising the fares for the elderly and disabled from 30 cents to 50 cents; and increasing special 35-cent fares on Anacostia buses to 60 cents.Some of these economies may have to be made U even if the city pays its current bill, given the staggering budget problems already confronting a government in transition and under strict congressional orders.

"Carry Trade' Reverse Shift Helped Drive Tuesday's Plunge. TOKYO -- One reason Tuesday's plunge in global stocks happened so fast involved money that helped fuel their recent rise: super-low-cost funds from Japan.From 2001 until July 2006, Japan's central bank kept its benchmark short-term interest rate at zero, and even after a rate increase last week, the rate is only 0.5%. That compares with 5.25% in the U.S. and 3.5% in the euro zone. The difference has enabled investors to profit by borrowing money in yen to buy higher-yielding assets denominated in other currencies.This technique is known as the carry trade -- because it takes advantage of the gap in returns, or ""carry,"" from different assets. Once the preserve of sophisticated financial traders like hedge funds, its use now has spread to include mutual funds and others in countries where yen loans are available.To execute a carry trade, investors have to sell the yen they borrow so they can buy assets in other currencies. With so many investors selling yen, the growth of the carry trade helped push down the yen in recent months to its lowest level in years against major currencies. That makes the carry trade more attractive because a falling yen makes profits earned in other currencies worth more in comparison.When concerns about the U.S. economy and overheated stock markets around the world helped trigger market drops Tuesday, investors say the unwinding of yen loans accelerated the declines. Market participants say it is likely that when some investors grew nervous, they began to sell their holdings in everything from Indian stocks to the Australian dollar and used the proceeds to buy yen to pay back their loans.",0,0,0.6695,0.3305

What's more, they flag February's producer price index data as a reminder of troublesome inflation.The week also holds reports on February housing starts and permits, retail sales and auto sales, and January's business inventories.

"A Gathering Economic Storm?. ""Will the world slump?"" asks a recent issue of the Economist. It's a good question without a good answer. All that can be said is that the economic crisis that began quietly in Thailand in July has now spread to much of Asia -- including Japan, Korea and Hong Kong -- and moved on to Brazil and even Russia. It could snowball into a broader economic downturn that would drag much of the world with it. Will it?The prevailing view is ""no."" Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress last week that Asia's problems, though serious, won't trigger a U.S. recession. The Economist also doubts a global slump. But optimism needs to be tempered, because the optimists have -- so far -- been wrong. The crisis is already worse than they expected, and plenty could still go wrong. Banking crises across Asia are a possibility. Another bad omen: the decision of the Mercosur trading bloc (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay) to raise tariffs 25 percent. This could signal a protectionist spiral that would depress world trade.The best that can be expected is that the crisis harms only a handful of countries. For them, economic growth drops sharply. Consider new estimates from Nariman Behravesh, chief global forecaster for Standard & Poor's DRI. The table below contrasts his forecasts before and after Asia's latest stock market and currency declines in late October and early November.Japan stumbles because its exports to Asia falter. And other countries are overextended. ""What we're seeing today is the tail end of the capital flow cycle,"" says economist Carmen Reinhart of the University of Maryland. In the 1990s, these countries have received massive foreign investment. Too much money flowed too quickly. First, foreign capital (mostly dollars) was converted into local currencies. Bad loans were made, bad projects were financed. Next, local consumers and companies converted some local currency back into foreign exchange to buy imports. Trade deficits swelled. ""Everyone's a genius in a boom,"" says Reinhart.And now the boom is over. Countries must curb trade deficits because they no longer receive the foreign capital needed to gorge on imports. Interest rates go up to slow spending. Brazil raised tariffs to choke imports. Other countries let their currencies depreciate (this makes imports more expensive and exports less expensive). Yet, Behravesh doesn't expect the world economy to slump. He's cut his 1998 forecast for global growth only slightly, from 2.9 to 2.5 percent. Though the United States and Europe lose some exports, their economies continue to expand. Most developed countries escape the crisis.",0,0,0.6806,0.3194

We are living in an American economic renaissance in which opportunity is abundant. Communities are getting stronger.

If it meets expectations, the deficit would be the smallest since 1989. As a percentage of the nation's total economic output, or gross domestic product, the deficit, at 2.3%, would be the smallest since 1979, the CBO said.The revised figures were reported as part of the CBO's midyear economic and budget update.In keeping with previous predictions, the CBO said the deficit would begin to increase again starting next year, rising to $189 billion in fiscal 1996. The 1996 deficit projection is $21 billion lower than earlier projections. Without efforts to reduce federal spending, as have been proposed by congressional Republicans, the deficit would reach $350 billion by 2002, the CBO said.The 1995 and 1996 deficits are expected to come in lower than anticipated largely due to factors such as declining interest rates, which the CBO said are expected to be about a full percentage point lower than previously forecast.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to add between 555 and 600 stores globally next year, adding 60 million square feet and becoming more aggressive in the number of supercenters it opens, Chief Financial Officer Tom Schoewe said in an interview.The world's largest retailer by sales plans to open 270 to 280 supercenters, which sell groceries and general merchandise, in the U.S. About 160 of these will be expansions or relocations of former discount stores. This year Wal-Mart had estimated it would add between 240 and 255 supercenters, but will end up with 266 new ones.""We are ahead of plan and the practical reality is that they are getting more difficult to open, but we're putting a larger number of projects in the hopper,"" Mr. Schoewe said shortly before Wal-Mart began its two-day analyst conference yesterday at its Bentonville, Ark., headquarters.Wal-Mart has seen sales growth in the U.S. slow down this year because of tougher competition, an uneven economic recovery and higher fuel prices. Nonetheless, the retailer's store-opening plans indicate it is bullish on its growth prospects. Indeed, Wal-Mart Chief Executive Lee Scott said yesterday, ""We could be three or four times bigger in the U.S.""Mr. Scott expects local zoning and land-use laws to grow stricter in coming years. The company is reckoning that stores built and opened sooner rather than later will face fewer delays.

WASHINGTON -- A dive in orders for big-ticket factory goods in March erased hopes that the recession will end for manufacturing in the next month or two.Orders to manufacturers for durable goods -- items intended to last more than three years, such as cars, appliances or heavy machinery -- sank 6.2% in March to the lowest level since August 1987, the Commerce Department reported.

He didn't think the Fed could deliver full employment. He regarded interest rates as a misleading measure of whether the Fed was loose or tight.He didn't trust central bankers. He blamed the Bank of Japan for the deflation of the 1990s and the Fed for the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great Inflation of the 1970s.

"Commerce Agency's Revised GNP Data Change View of Economic Performance. WASHINGTON -- When the Commerce Department released figures late last year showing a substantial improvement in economic growth during the fourth quarter of 1984, the news was cheered by traders, economic analysts and politicians alike.But last week the department released revised figures indicating those cheers were for nought. Instead of growing at an inflation-adjusted 4.3% rate, as previously thought, the new figures showed economic growth was limping in the fourth quarter of 1984 at a meager 0.6% pace.That drastic change illustrates how the highly technical ""benchmark"" statistical revisions completed recently by the department have revamped the economic landscape. The department is the sole source of statistics on the nation's total output, or gross national product, and when it alters its numbers, it alters everyone else's view of the world.The department's revisions altered virtually all the GNP figures back to 1972, and in some cases reached as far back as 1929. The revisions reflected newly available information, improved estimating techniques and a shift in the price ""base,"" used in adjusting GNP for inflation, to 1982 from 1972.For the Reagan administration, the revisions make the economic record look less successful. The revisions show, among other things, that the 1982 recession was more severe than previously thought, and that the expansion that has followed isn't quite as strong as earlier statistics had suggested.",1,1,0.0,1.0

"U.S. News: Fed to Keep Rates Low Despite Pickup. The Federal Reserve affirmed its plan to keep interest rates ""exceptionally low"" for a long time despite signs of economic recovery.

"Central Bank's Mandate Draws a Spotlight. With unemployment at 9.6% and inflation below the Federal Reserve's working definition of ""price stability,"" this seems a strange moment for Congress to contemplate instructing the Fed to focus exclusively on fighting inflation.But Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) wants to revive that notion, which has lain dormant for more than a decade because there has been so little inflation. ""I am concerned about inflation down the road,"" he explains. ""The time is right for us to bring clarity to the Fed."" In the House, Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) and Michael Pence (R., Ind.) agree. Mr. Pence argues that the Fed's quest to combat unemployment by buying $600 billion in U.S. Treasurys is a failure and threatens to ""monetize our debt and trigger inflation.""The implication is that the Fed has lost its moorings. Has it really? For more than 30 years, Congress has charged the Fed with aiming at ""maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."" That wording has long made some Fed officials and academic economists uneasy because it is rooted in a now-abandoned view that the government could dial up a little more inflation to get a little less unemployment and vice versa.The current consensus is that the Fed can -- and, indeed, is now attempting to -- reduce unemployment in a recession, but in the long run can deliver only price stability. What Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke calls ""the longer-run sustainable unemployment rate"" is determined by demographics, job-market rules and other factors beyond the Fed's control. In this view, if the Fed tried to push unemployment too low now, it could create too much inflation later, the mistake the Fed made in the late 1970s.But it is not the 1970s. Even though the Fed has been holding short-term interest rates near zero for nearly two years, prices rose at only a 1% annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. No measure of inflation expectations foresees anything like the 8%-plus inflation of the '70s. And it's hard to find a single Greenspan or Bernanke decision that would have been different if they had an inflation-only mandate. So why all this now?",1,1,0.3248,0.6752

The 0.7 percent increase in consumer spending last month was the fastest advance since a 1.2 percent rise in April.The government also made significant revisions to previous months showing that income growth and consumer spending were not as sluggish as previously believed.Analysts said the figures suggested that the Federal Reserve, which had been allowing interest rates to fall since early summer in hopes of stimulating the economy to grow faster, would delay further declines for at least a while.Just a month ago, there were widespread fears that the nation was falling into recession as a series of government statistics showed weak growth.",1,0,1.0,0.0
"Hiring Weakness Goes On, Survey Shows; War's End May Not Turn Around Trend. Hiring activity continues to deteriorate, and the end to the Persian Gulf war may not prove enough to turn the situation around.A quarterly job-outlook survey suggests that the weakness in hiring has reached 1982 recession levels nationally and, in some geographic areas, has fallen below those levels.The survey by Manpower Inc., which canvassed 15,000 companies, projects that net hiring strength in the second quarter will decline for the ninth quarter in a row, when adjusted for seasonal factors.The employment-services concern found that, on an unadjusted basis, 18% of the companies plan to increase hiring in the second quarter, while 13% plan to reduce their work force. About 65% said they anticipate no change, and 4% didn't respond. That projected five percentage-point net hiring increase contrasts with a plus 18% a year ago and is the lowest for any second quarter since 1982, when it was a similar five percentage points.Manpower noted that the latest survey was taken before last week's Persian Gulf cease-fire. But Mitchell Fromstein, Manpower president, maintains that although peace should improve the hiring picture somewhat, it probably won't provide the necessary lift to generate a turnaround. ""To the degree that the war worsened the employment situation, (the end of war) should now improve it, leaving the basic underlying recession as it was,"" he says. ""We're better off than we were a week ago, but are we better off than six months ago? The answer is no.""",0,0,1.0,0.0
"Bernanke Leaves Investors Disappointed. Author: Michael CaseyNEW YORK--Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke left investors disappointed after he painted a gloomy picture of the U.S. economy but gave no indication the Fed is preparing any new stimulus measures.Stocks and other assets with greater exposure to risk fell, while U.S. Treasurys and the dollar gained as Mr. Bernanke delivered his much-awaited semiannual address to Congress, describing the economic outlook as ""unusually uncertain.""The Fed chairman reiterated the Fed's official view that interest rates would stay near zero for ""an extended period."" But although he stressed that it is ""prepared to take further policy actions as needed to foster a return to full utilization of our nation's productive potential,"" he offered no new policy options for reversing the recent slowdown in the U.S. economic recovery.In answer to senators' questions, Mr. Bernanke later explored the possibility of further stimulus measures ""if the recovery seems to be faltering,"" but in failing to address this in his prepared remarks he left investors disappointed. In the lead-up to his appearance, there had been growing speculation that the Fed chairman might signal the central bank's willingness to cease paying interest on the reserves it holds on banks' behalf, a move that would be an incentive for banks to lend that money to customers. Indeed, Mr. Bernanke mentioned that idea, along with other prospects for added stimulus in the question-and-answer session, although he said that for now the Fed was still intent on gauging the strength of the recovery.",1,1,0.3277,0.6723
"Experts Advise Steering Clear Of Asian Stocks. It has been nearly a year since Thailand devalued the baht, setting off worldwide market drops -- and what a ride it has been.Most Asian portfolio managers would probably prefer to put the past 12 months well behind them, if they haven't quit their jobs already and decided to sail around the world instead. And pity the small investor, avidly checking up on the performance of his Asian mutual funds over breakfast only to find that day after day, Asian markets suffered staggering declines.Since July 2, 1997 when Thailand let the baht float, Asian currencies and stock markets have crumbled, jolting emerging markets from Brazil to Russia.

"Why We Need the IMF. Since the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis, it has been open season for attacks on the International Monetary Fund. We have been told that the prospect of IMF bailouts caused the crisis and that the IMF's existence, if continued unchanged, will result in many more financial disruptions. Distinguished former cabinet officials, writing on this page, have asked ""Who Needs the IMF?"" And this newspaper has added its editorial voice to the chorus.Here's a more balanced perspective: In a globalized economy, everyone needs the IMF. Without the IMF, the world economy would not become an idealized fantasy of perfectly liquid, completely informed, totally unregulated capital markets. Investors and lenders would still make decisions on the basis of imperfect information, and they would have to take into account the absence of an international lender of last resort. This would be a serious, perhaps devastating, defect. In fact, we got a good sense of life without the IMF in the 1920s and 1930s. The results included widespread competitive devaluation and trade wars in response to balance-of-payments problems, followed by a plunge into global depression and world war.Without a guarantor of international liquidity, many good loans would not be made. Fundamentally sound private investment projects in emerging markets can be dragged down by decisions external to the businesses involved. Even prudent government policies can be waylaid by unforeseeable shocks. Either way, fundamentally good investments will run into temporary liquidity problems. In a world of flexible exchange rates, such temporary problems can be magnified by accompanying drops in the value of the domestic currency. IMF programs finance the adjustment necessary to give these countries and firms time to let their fundamentals pay off.Thus, the IMF is the sovereign nations' credit union. It imposes strict conditions on countries' policies for bridge loans to get through hard times. Only a multilateral institution like the IMF could exert the discipline required without causing an unacceptable affront to a country's sovereignty. The benefits to the borrowing nation are that the adjustment program will be less painful and any resulting contraction less severe. The benefits to the lending countries are not only the availability of those credits to themselves, if and when they need them (as even the U.S. has), but a smaller contraction of world demand associated with the borrowing country's adjustment.Some have claimed that these IMF conditions have been misapplied in the Asian crisis, demanding either too much austerity or unjustified structural reform. But IMF conditionality is highly pragmatic. Since the current crisis was not caused in large part by macroeconomic policies, but by financial fragility and lack of transparency, the conditions were designed to respond to those causes. The fund has been ready to renegotiate its programs and to loosen austerity (such as the inflation target for South Korea) as matters stabilized. There always is room for improvement in individual IMF programs. But attacks on the basic idea of IMF conditionality are thoroughly misguided.",0,0,1.0,0.0
"Decline in Rates Reduces Interest In 'Zero' Issues. With the long drop in interest rates, corporate zero-coupon bonds haven't been getting much attention lately.That's probably just as well for many investors. But for others, some market professionals say, corporate ""zeros"" could be worth a fresh look.Zero-coupon bonds, which are issued at a steep discount from their face value, were very popular when rates were high. Not only could investors ""lock in"" a high rate of return for years to come, they didn't have to worry about how to reinvest periodic interest payments because there aren't any. Instead, investors profit from the difference between the issue price and the face amount payable at maturity.Last year, however, corporations issued only $703.3 million of zero-coupon bonds, according to IDD Information Services Inc. That was less than a third of the record $2.46 billion issued in 1985.Uncertainty about tax overhaul discouraged both issuers and buyers in 1986, but lower interest rates were the major factor.

"U.S. Merchandise Trade Gap Shrank During 1st Quarter.

"Clinton economic initiatives strengthen U.S. position as G-7 prepares to meet. WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has a greatly strengthened hand as Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen heads to London for tomorrow's meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the seven largest industrialized nations.In his first meeting with his counterparts from the other Group of Seven nations, Mr. Bentsen is almost certain to argue that the U.S. is finally doing what its allies have demanded: Raising taxes to shrink its budget deficit, helping to reduce pressure on world interest rates and ease inflationary fears.In exchange, the U.S. is likely to argue, the Japanese and Germans should do their part to enhance the prospects for world economic growth.

"Campaign '08: Housing Ideas Highlight Clinton-Obama Economic Divide. During his final swing through Ohio before the state's primary tomorrow, Sen. Barack Obama has ramped up his attacks on predatory lending while muting his criticism of rival Sen. Hillary Clinton's proposal to freeze interest rates for five years on adjustable-rate mortgages.Sen. Obama's approach underscores the tricky balancing act he faces: He has staked out a centrist position on the foreclosure crisis while he courts the voters in Ohio who have been hit hard by the foreclosure crisis.Sen. Clinton advocates a more interventionist approach that promises immediate action. The New York senator's plan would freeze foreclosures for 90 days to allow lenders to work out problems with borrowers, and she wants the loan-rate freeze for certain mortgages. David Axelrod, an Obama campaign strategist, has acknowledged the ""political resonance"" of the Clinton plan, particularly in cities like Cleveland, which has the sixth-highest foreclosure rate in the country. But the Obama campaign has criticized the Clinton proposal as one that would dry up credit and exacerbate the current economic pain.While Sen. Obama supports a foreclosure freeze, the Illinois senator hasn't made it an explicit part of his economic proposal. During a town hall in the Cleveland suburb of Parma Heights on Saturday, he suggested that the Bush administration's agreement last week with major lenders to freeze some foreclosures for 30 days was insufficient.

Chairman Warren E. Buffett or Fidelity Magellan Fund's former manager, Peter Lynch, tend to be good long before they hit age 40. And people who invested with Buffett from his earliest days now are worth tens of millions of dollars.In any generation, of course, the best investment managers share at least three traits: They are smart, rational and willing to put the client's interests first. They always have the biggest chunk of their financial net worth invested alongside their clients', and they only profit when their partners do too.But some of the best young investment managers subscribe to a proven investment approach known as ""value investing,"" which emphasizes buying the securities of companies for less than their true worth. The managers are the intellectual descendants of the late Benjamin Graham, a great investor and Columbia University instructor whose most famous student was Buffett. Graham bought stocks in mediocre companies selling at huge discounts and held them only until the price-to-value gap narrowed.

"When Deficit, Job Goals Conflict. For some time now, it has been apparent that something has gone askew with the old-time relationship of economic growth to job creation. In the past couple of years, new technologies have enabled many companies, especially large manufacturers, to churn out the same volume of production with fewer and fewer employees.This phenomenon may represent a disconnect between economic growth and jobs, and set back President Clinton's hope for a meaningful economic recovery. The fact that unemployment sticks around 7 percent disturbs consumer confidence - not only among those out of work, but among people who still have jobs.Some analysts contend that there really is nothing new in the equation that a surge in demand won't cure: Eventually, optimists say, companies now using overtime and temporary workers to fill their labor needs will have to add to regular payrolls.But what will produce that rising demand?

In January, catapulting food and energy prices drove the index up 1.1%, its largest monthly increase in more than seven years. The record drop in heating oil prices last month followed a 26.3% jump in January. Overall energy prices fell 0.7% in February after jumping 5.1% in January. Food prices, which soared 1.8% in January after the cold wave destroyed crops, grew 0.5% in February.Many economists said that despite the retreat from January's sharp advance, February still leaves inflation worrisomely high.""I think this shows inflation is a very stubborn problem,"" said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. ""There is simply no evidence as yet that the Federal Reserve has been able to bring down the core rate of inflation.""",1,1,0.0,1.0
"Money Managers Could Hardly Miss in '85, But Some Picks Proved Better Than Others. With the market enjoying one of its best years ever, one might imagine that money managers found it as easy to pick winning stocks as to shoot fish in a barrel.On the whole that was true. For the first time in a few years, most money managers' stock portfolios in 1985 matched or surpassed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which rose about 25%. The Nasdaq index of over-the-counter stocks gained about 30%. So it isn't surprising that the professional stock pickers featured early last year in The Wall Street Journal also look pretty good. But some did better than others.At the end of 1984, we asked five investment managers to peer into their crystal balls and foretell which stocks and groups would likely be winners in 1985. The prophecies they shared with us don't necessarily represent a comprehensive investment strategy and so they're not reliable guides to the money managers' overall performance. Still, we thought it worth reviewing our report of their stock selections to see which worked out and which didn't.Peter Lynch, who runs the Magellan Fund for Fidelity Management & Research in Boston, scored huge gains on six out of eight stocks he named. Like many investors, Mr. Lynch foresaw flat or declining interest rates in 1985, which led him to favor thrifts and some growth stocks. But his selections did much better than average, showing that stock picking is an art even in a bull market.Mr. Lynch staked his money on little-known thrifts that had recently converted to stock ownership from operating as depositor-owned institutions. ""It wasn't just an interest rate bet,"" he says. ""I thought they would do better because the managers were now owners"" of shares in a publicly traded company. ""You had capitalism on your side,"" the money manager says.",0,0,1.0,0.0

"Fed Not Likely To Tinker With Monetary Dials: Fed Not Expected to Tinker With Monetary Policy. The Federal Reserve has not changed the settings of its monetary policy dials since last December and is not expected to do so this week when its policymaking group meets, according to Federal Reserve officials.With the economic recovery looking stronger every day, and with most measures of the money supply within or above their target ranges, there is little immediate reason for the central bank to actively try to reduce interest rates at the moment.Similarly, there is little pressure to tighten policy, either. Officials at the Fed expect inflation to remain low this year even with a healthy recovery, and the explosive growth of the money supply in the first three months of 1983 has slowed.The Fed has the luxury of not having to make any policy shifts right now partly because the big increase in U.S. Treasury borrowing in recent months has not, as many analysts feared, produced a surge in interest rates. Rates have not moved upward because business borrowing has gone down and consumer demand has risen only slowly as the Treasury has jumped into the market with both feet.Commercial and industrial loans at commercial banks were no higher in April than they were last October, while the amount of commercial paper outstandingUOan alternative source of short-term business creditUOplummeted at a 42.5 percent annual rate between November and February, the latest month for which figures are available.",1,0,0.6675,0.3325
"Downturn Made States and Cities More Dependent on Property Taxes. A new analysis shows that cash-strapped state and local governments have increasingly come to depend on property taxes to fill revenue shortfalls as other sources of income soured.Though not an unexpected trend during economic downturns, the reliance on property taxes has lasted well beyond the end of the recession of 2001. Economists say it is has been of greater depth, and likely will have more lasting consequences, than it did during prior downturns.In good part, that's because the soaring housing market has lifted the median price of single-family homes by 15%, making property taxes attractive to state and municipal governments facing spending increases. Meanwhile, states have grown more reluctant to lift income or sales taxes in recent years for fear of political retribution, economists say. In some cases, they are even prevented from doing so by laws passed during the 1990s boom.""The local property tax is one tax the local [authorities] can use to offset declines in state money,"" says William Fischel, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College. ""To some extent, if the state is sending municipalities or even school districts less money because they're in fiscally difficult times, the one tax the local [authorities] have some discretion over raising is the property tax.""Though municipalities can offset rising property values by changing their millage rates, or the rates at which taxes are levied on properties, many strapped municipalities chose not to do so in recent years. ""Ultimately, what determines whether property taxes go up is the overall budget for the taxing district,"" says Matt Gardner, state- tax-policy director with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington, D.C.",1,1,0.3255,0.6745

"Productivity Grows at Slow 1% Pace, Reflecting Sluggishness in Economy. WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department boosted its estimate of non-farm productivity for the second quarter, but the figures are still symptomatic of a sluggish economy.Per-hour work output in the non-farm economy rose at a 1% annual rate in the second period, the department said, double the 0.5% rate estimated last month, but still relatively low.The change in the figure primarily reflects the revision the Commerce Department announced last week in its second-quarter estimate of the nation's total production, or gross national product. The revision put GNP growth at a modest 2% annual rate, up from the 1.7% rate calculated in July. The Commerce Department said the upward revision mostly was due to a larger-than-expected rise in inventories during June.The revised second-quarter productivity gain is based on a 2.2% increase in non-farm output and a 1.2% increase in hours worked. The earlier estimate was based on a 1.9% increase in output and a 1.4% increase in hours. All the figures represent seasonally adjusted annual rates.The latest productivity figures continue a pattern of peaks and valleys that characterize economic growth in the later stages of an economic cycle. Productivity generally rises sharply in the early stages of a business recovery and then tapers off as employers hire more workers.

"For the Record rxf 6  . THE NEW TAX LAW is a striking signal of the sharp reversal in political purpose that made the 95th Congress extraordinary. It abandoned the orthodoxies that its predecessors had followed for nearly a generation. This dramatic change in attitudes reaches well beyond taxation, and it is being generated by a stagnation of the economy that has already run at least five years.Successive Congresses had whittled away at the tax code for years, making it generally a little more progressive, shifting the burden slowly to the wealthier taxpayers. Throughout the 1960s, but particularly during the Nixon years, presidents and Congresses had joined in a massive expansion of social benefits to citizens, most notably in old-age pensions and medical care. The numbers of people living in poverty steadily declined. It was all financed out of economic growthUOwhich, during the long boom of the 1960s, was phenomenal. As long as the size of the pie kept increasing, it was never necessary to reduce the incomes of some in order to give more to others. The only question was over the distribution of the dividends of growth.Hut that pattern of growth ended in the early 1970s. Last weekthe Labor Department published figures showing that earnings of wage and salary workers. corrected for inflation, have not increased over the past year and, in fact, remain lower than they were in 1973 before the recession. If the pie is no longer growing, then the political implications of the old policies change profoundly.

"Greenspan: Credit Crunch Dims Recovery. The economic recovery is continuing but the difficulty borrowers are having getting loans at troubled U.S. banks is keeping its pace subdued, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told President Bush and top administration officials at a White House meeting yesterday.Bush said the meeting of the administration's Economic Policy Council, the second this week, was called to discuss economic ""initiatives and where we stand."" The sessions came as new polling results showed that the weakened state of the U.S. economy is hurting Bush's standing with the American public.Afterward, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Greenspan expressed confidence that ""the underlying factors are strong and we are coming out of the recession. ... The credit {crunch} problem was identified as one of the biggest obstacles at this point at getting responsiveness in the economy.""The president is particularly concerned that bank examiners not be providing a chilling effect on the availability of money at a time when interest rates are going down,"" he said.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department issued another report showing the erratic month-to-month pattern the economy seems to be following. It said Americans' disposable personal income rose 0.2 percent faster than inflation last month following a 0.1 percent dip in July.

"Baltimore loses share of federal spending. In the aftermath of the Cold War and the last recession, the federal government has increased spending in Washington's Maryland suburbs while reducing spending in the Baltimore area, researchers at the University of Baltimore said yesterday.The Washington area's focus on service industries has given it an advantage over the Baltimore area's manufacturing-intensive economy in the competition for increasingly scarce Department of Defense contracts, because the Pentagon's shopping priorities have shifted from weapons systems to services, researcher Richard P. Clinch said.In addition, the presence of the federal government appears to have buoyed the Washington area economy in relation to its rival to the north. Washington's Maryland suburbs have experienced a much sharper increase in nonmilitary procurement than the Baltimore area has.Clinch directed a study, sponsored by eight corporations, of the ability of Maryland's economy to adjust to structural changes and shifts in federal spending.Overall U.S. government purchases of goods and services in the Baltimore area declined by 15.6 percent from 1990, their peak year, to 1993, the study found. But such purchases rose by 25.8 percent in the Maryland suburbs of Washington over the same period, according to the study, which did not take inflation into account.",1,1,0.3667,0.6333
"Ehrlich confirms he'll run again; Md. ex-governor says challenge to O'Malley isn't a grudge match. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. said Tuesday that he will try to win his old job back in November, confirming plans for a much-anticipated rematch with Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who defeated him in a bitter contest four years ago.A formal announcement, planned for next Wednesday in Montgomery County, will set up a rematch between two of the state's dominant political personalities.Both are fierce competitors. Their 2006 race was highly negative and at times intensely personal, with Ehrlich (R) repeatedly calling O'Malley ""a whiner"" and running ads that highlighted the homicide rate and struggling schools in Baltimore, where O'Malley was mayor. O'Malley (D) accused Ehrlich of dirty tricks and portrayed him as cozy with energy lobbyists and an unpopular President George W.

"Non-Banks Are Non-Starters. Congressmen on the House Banking Committee have been getting themselves into something of a lather about the danger that the giant money-center banks, with the connivance of the Comptroller of the Currency, are about to make an end run around the rules forbidding interstate banking. But the play the banks have chosen for this purpose is virtually guaranteed to leave them at the line of scrimmage (if not behind it). Ideally, the congressmen should calm down -- and the banks should forget it. We should be so lucky, on either side.""The commercial banks went into the consumer business for the cheap money,"" John Heimann said when he was Comptroller of the Currency a few years ago. ""Now that the cheap money is gone, they will go into other businesses.""That made sense: The most casual look at annual reports demonstrated that there was no longer any reason for the New York and Chicago banks to envy the Bank of America and North Carolina National Bank because they had branches all over their states and funded their loans from people's checking accounts. Inflation and the market interest rates it created had persuaded lots of ordinary middle-class people to economize on cash and keep money in interest-bearing accounts even if they planned to spend it fairly soon. If the banks were going to have to buy the money they lent, branches were a very expensive way to make the purchases. Indeed, many of the big banks have been confirming this analysis during the past few years by closing long-established branches -- some noisily with public pronouncements, some stealthily to avoid stirring up the animals among the consumer-activist groups.Now, quite suddenly, the big banks have filed requests with the Comptroller for charters that would allow them to operate 300 new branches in other states. These would not even be real, full-service branches, for the McFadden Act and the Douglas Amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act still forbid banks to open branches or subsidiary banks in states other than their home state, unless the state that is being invaded has given its approval. The charters being requested are for what the trade calls ""non-bank banks,"" a Dr. Seuss creature born of the cleverness of the late Charles Bluhdorn's Gulf & Western in exploiting the definition of the word ""bank"" written into the 1970 amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act.Under those amendments, a bank is a bank only if it both accepts demand deposits subject to withdrawal by check and makes commercial loans. It is fashionable these days to describe this definition as a ""loophole,"" but in fact there was considerable discussion in the Senate (where the language originated) about the need to protect finance companies, trust companies, savings and loan associations, and credit unions from the stifling regulatory embrace of the Federal Reserve. Moreover, the definition is reasonable: A bank that cannot take demand deposits is out of the loop of money creation (what goes out of the bank via the lending or withdrawal doors does not come back in automatically in the flow of people's payments for goods and services), and a bank that does not make commercial loans clearly isn't a ""commercial bank,"" which is the kind of bank people mean when they use the word.",0,0,1.0,0.0

"Regional Report: Attacks' Effect on Regional Outlook --- Prospects Dim Across U.S., With Tourism States And Northeast Hit Hard. ECONOMIC RIPPLES from last week's terrorist attacks are being felt in all regions of the U.S. But the force of the impact will depend very much on where you live.Among the hardest hit will be states and cities built on tourism, including Florida and Las Vegas. They were holding up best amid a slumping economy before the attacks. But now that air travel has been hobbled by security fears, sharply reduced visits by vacationers and business travelers have dimmed those economic bright spots.A few regions may weather the storm better: oil-producing economies such as Houston and Louisiana; defense-contracting strongholds such as Southern California and northern Virginia; and areas where displaced Manhattan firms are setting up temporary or permanent offices, most notably New Jersey, which could gain as many as 100,000 jobs.Still, few places, if any, will escape unscathed. ""There is no part of the country whose outlook has not worsened,"" says Mark Vitner, economist for First Union Securities in Charlotte, N.C.The impact of the attacks will whack from one to more than three percentage points off anticipated growth in output over the next nine months, depending on the region and whether the expected U.S. military response is relatively quickly resolved or protracted and uncertain. Overall, the U.S. gross national product -- the value of all goods and services produced -- would grow only 1.5% between the second quarters of 2001 and 2002 under the more optimistic scenario and contract 0.05% under the more pessimistic assumption, according to Economy.com, a West Chester, Pa., economic-consulting firm.

"Kips Bay: Same House, Different Times. In 1989 a five-story town house on Manhattan's Upper East Side was put up for sale for $11 million. That same year the premises played host to the country's most prestigious decorator show house, benefiting the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club.Two years later the town house at 121 E. 73rd St. is still for sale, the asking price having been reduced to $6 million. That says a lot about the state of the real estate market. It also says something about the Kips Bay Show House, which is once again ensconced in the neo-Federal residence built in 1908 for lawyer Alfred Jaretzki, his wife, Tillie, and three children.The organizers decided to reprise the show in the empty mansion because it was difficult to another suitable one in the desired locale, according to Diantha Nype, show house publicist for 17 years. The committee, which sank $57,000 into rewiring and fixing the walls in preparation for the first show, was happily spared further refurbishing costs. So were the designers, who benefited from replastering and other repairs made by their colleagues in 1989. Typically, designers have to pony up $5,000 to $50,000 per room for painting and other non-recuperable decorating expenses.Competition among designers this year was as intense as always, according toNype. The 14 tapped by the selection committee were chosen from 83 top New York designers who were asked to apply (designers can participate once every three years). The show house, which earned about $900,000 last year, is the primary source of funding for the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club in the Bronx.In the old money stratosphere in which they operate, most of the Kips Bay designers interviewed at the house declared their businesses recession proof.

"Japan Reports Another Surge In Trade Surplus --- Total Leaped to $3.84 Billion In January; Imports Fell, Exports Expanded 9.7%. TOKYO -- Japan's merchandise-trade surplus more than quadrupled in January from a year earlier, as cheaper oil prices held down the value of imports and exports expanded by a healthy 9.7%.The surplus widened to $3.84 billion from a revised $911 million a year earlier, marking the 13th consecutive month of year-on-year increases, a fact that is certain to put more political pressures on Japan to narrow the imbalance.The trade surplus with the U.S. rose for the sixth straight month, climbing 2.4% to $2.45 billion from $2.40 billion. Exports to the U.S. increased 1% to $6.73 billion. Auto exports fell 19.4% in volume and 12.3% in value. Imports from the U.S. inched up 0.3% to $4.29 billion. But excluding a near-quadrupling in the volume of aircraft imports during the month, imports from the U.S. actually dropped 2%.Many analysts said the numbers were in line with expectations and noted that January figures can be skewed by Japan's long New Year's holidays. Nevertheless, most analysts expect the surplus to widen through the year.

"Bond Yields Are Viewed Staying Flat --- Until Clinton Plans Are Known, Rates Unlikely to Decline. NEW YORK -- In the bond market, the wolf isn't at the door. But he is in the neighborhood and headed toward the house.That's the view of many investors who have braced for a Democratic presidency by driving up the long-term Treasury bond yield more than one-half percentage point in two months to 7.76%, the highest since midyear.Looking ahead, economists and money managers expect bond yields to remain flat to higher until after President-elect Bill Clinton announces his economic program. They don't expect any big surge in yields unless Mr. Clinton does something rash -- such as announce a deficit-widening blitz of short-term government spending.

"Board of Contributors: Capital Gains: The Sequel. The president has now opened the second round of his drive to cut the capital-gains tax rate. That was expected, but it is nevertheless too bad. The whole struggle is a great waste of time and energy for the president, the Congress and the country.There is at best only slight evidence that cutting the tax rate will have the positive effects claimed -- on saving, investment, productivity, jobs or revenue. In my opinion, the idea is logically, morally and economically offensive -- but it won't kill us. The important thing now is to get it over with quickly. Then perhaps we can get on with more serious business -- uplifting the underclass, educating our children, controlling drugs and crime, adapting the armed forces to a new security situation, and providing some models of civic virtue, for example.Since there is no hope of escaping the capital-gains tax argument, I offer some suggestions that may strike reasonable people as reasonable.Inflation Adjustment: There seems to be a great deal of agreement, probably more than is deserved, on adjusting capital gains for inflation. Two problems arise in this connection.First, should the inflation adjustment apply to future inflation on assets currently held or should it apply only to inflation on assets acquired after the law is changed? The answer to that is clear, except, of course, to the present holders of assets. Since the motive for the change is primarily to increase the incentive to make a certain kind of investment, there is no point in rewarding the investments that already have been made. The adjustment should apply to assets hereafter acquired.",0,0,1.0,0.0

"Dollar Rises to Challenge the Orthodoxy. Only a few months ago, it was common to hear that the only thing holding the dollar up was massive buying by foreign central banks. On April 18, for example, a typical article in a British journal suggested that in the preceding year, Treasury Secretary Baker ""has taken out balance of payments insurance by persuading foreign central banks to suppress an upsurge of American interest rates by purchasing nearly $200 billion of U.S. securities"" (emphasis added). If the central banks ever stopped financing our trade deficit by buying Treasury securities, the experts agreed, then the dollar would drop by 30% and interest rates would soar.Now, however, foreign central banks are not only not buying dollars, but instead selling billions. Yet the dollar nonetheless remains quite strong, and U.S. bond yields have gone down, not up. If it really required $100 billion to $200 billion of intervention to prop up the dollar, how can things have suddenly changed so much? Much credit for the dollar's firming is given to recent dramatic narrowing of the monthly trade-deficit figures. But in actual dollar terms, that is not the big story.What has changed in the first half of 1988 appears to be mainly the capital account (investment) rather than the current account (trade). Americans are investing less abroad, leaving fewer foreign transactions to finance by selling dollars, while foreigners are investing more in the U.S., and thus buying dollars to finance those investments. The U.S. is clearly looking relatively more attractive to world investors. Bond prices have recently increased in the U.S., but fallen in Germany, the U.K. and Japan. Stock prices are also near this year's peak in the U.S., but the largest foreign stock markets are well below their peaks when measured in U.S. dollars.Of course, the dollar's rise and the improved picture for U.S. investments are mutually reinforcing -- it is hard to pinpoint where the chicken-and-egg cycle began. But by itself, the stronger dollar should take some competitive pricing pressure off the industries of countries such as Germany and Japan, thus helping their stocks. So, the fact that their markets nonetheless remain much weaker than those here, when measured in the same currency, indicates that discounted profit opportunities look stronger in the U.S.The U.S. is not alone. Canada, Australia and, until recently, the United Kingdom all experienced sharp increases in both their currencies and stock markets this year, relative to Continental Europe. Interestingly, Canada and the U.S. both reduced marginal tax rates in January, while Australia announced lower tax rates for the near future.

The suspension, disclosed in a late filing Monday with the SEC, comes after the Cupertino, Calif., computer maker reported a loss of $69 million, or 56 cents a share, for its first quarter ended Dec. 29. The suspension begins with that quarter, in which the loss resulted from a glut of unsold computers and fierce pricing wars around the world, among other factors.With sales this year falling off as a result of customer uncertainty over its future, Apple recently said it expects an operating loss during the current quarter ending March 29 to ""significantly exceed"" the loss for the prior quarter. The company also has said it expects to incur charges of at least $125 million during this quarter for costs related to restructuring. Analysts say it may take two more quarters for the company to return to profitability under its new chief executive officer, Gilbert F. Amelio, who succeeded his ousted predecessor, Michael Spindler, earlier this month.",0,0,1.0,0.0
"Cost-Cutting Airlines Grapple With Issue of Executive Pay. A HARSH DOWNDRAFT grips the U.S. airline industry, with five carriers stuck in bankruptcy court and others amassing extensive red ink. Whipsawed by sky-high fuel prices, lower fares and a glut of seats, nine of the 10 biggest carriers by traffic are expected to report fourth-quarter losses. Five did so last week.Distressed airlines typically pin their survival hopes on huge savings from worker concessions. But slashing rank-and-file paychecks creates a management conundrum. Union members want senior executives to share their financial pain. Indeed, the prior heads of Delta Air Lines and AMR Corp. got forced out partly due to union ire over executive sacrifices perceived as inadequate. Yet further curbs on the compensation of the airlines' top brass could push even more of them out of the executive suite.""It's a real tough dilemma,"" says Kim Cameron, a University of Michigan management professor. While profitability and stock prices usually rise when leaders share their subordinates' pay pain, pressure to pinch executive pay harder could weaken carriers' chances for recovery by increasing the tempo of management turnover.""If you pay below market, you get what you pay for,"" says a former vice president of a troubled major carrier who joined a start-up airline earlier this month. ""You will be left with the 'B' team.""As it now stands, virtually no upper-management wallet at sick airlines remains untouched, but the extent of slimmed compensation varies by carrier. Delta's chief executive officer, Gerald Grinstein, skipped his $500,000 annual salary for six months last year. And since he became head of the Atlanta airline in January 2004 (after having been a Delta board member), Mr. Grinstein has taken no other remuneration.",0,1,0.3136,0.6864
"Recession Deeper In First Quarter;Variety of Economic Indicators Down. Every part of the U.S. economy - consumer spending, business investment, housing, government purchases, even exports - declined in the first three months of 1991, confirming the country's slide into its first recession since 1982, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.The department said the gross national product, the country's output of goods and services, fell at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter after adjustment for inflation. The drop followed a decline at the rate of 1.6 percent in the final three months of last year.The extended fall in economic activity left economists divided yesterday on how long the downturn might last.Many forecasters, including those in the Bush administration, expect the recession to hit bottom sometime during the current quarter, but some other economists saw details of yesterday's report - particularly a large decline in business spending on new plants and equipment - as an indication that the recovery will not begin until later.""It was a broadly based decline in economic activity,"" said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, ""and it looks as though there will be another decline in the second quarter.""",1,1,0.3625,0.6375
"Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged --- Low Inflation Is Decisive; Economists Are Divided On Rise in Near Future. WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left its key short-term interest rate unchanged, confirming that its fears of imminent inflation have subsided. But economists are divided over whether the central bank will still have to tighten monetary policy in the coming months to damp growth.Yesterday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was the second consecutive time that Fed officials chose to leave monetary policy alone after pushing through a controversial quarter-point increase in the federal-funds rate in March. The Fed's target for the federal-funds rate, or the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight, remains at 5 1/2%.Although the inaction was widely anticipated, the stock market rallied after the decision was disclosed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, down nearly 20 points just before the 2:15 p.m. announcement, ended the day up 73.05 points to close at 7795.38. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond gained 12/32, or about $3.75 for a $1,000 bond, to close at 98 27/32. The yield fell to 6.71% from 6.73%.The Fed's decision to keep interest rates at current levels stems from two recent economic developments. First, numerous signs indicate that economic growth in the second quarter slowed from the red-hot 5.9% pace of the first period. Just yesterday, for example, the Commerce Department reported that factory orders fell 0.7% in May, reversing a 1.4% jump in April.The second trend giving comfort to the Fed has been inflation's moderation, despite strong growth earlier in the year and an unemployment rate below 5% -- a level most mainstream economists consider likely to trigger higher wages and prices.",1,0,0.6842,0.3158

"Common Sense: Interest-Rate Shift to Affect Your Fixed-Income Investments. SmartMoneyLAST WEEK'S gentle summer rally was helped along by a cease-fire in Lebanon, a modest drop in oil prices, and especially a growing consensus that the Federal Reserve may have indeed stopped raising interest rates, as opposed to ""pausing"" in its pursuit of higher rates.Still, this is no time for complacency. Interest-rate cycles usually last years, and don't change overnight. Even so, it's becoming apparent that we're in the midst of a historic shift from a long period of rising short-term interest rates to one of flat to declining rates, which will likely have an impact on the fixed-income portion of your portfolio.Lately, it's been pretty easy to be a fixed-income investor. All you had to do was put cash in a money-market fund and collect ever-rising yields, while putting your bond allocation into one- to three-year certificates of deposit. With the yield curve nearly flat, and even inverted at times, you could capture maximum returns of close to 5% with minimal risk. True, this approach wasn't earning double-digit returns, but you sure didn't lose any sleep.It also turns out this was a good strategy this year, one of those relatively rare periods when cash outperformed longer-term bonds. So far in 2006, cash equivalents earned 2.9%, while 10-year Treasurys lost 1%.",0,0,1.0,0.0

"Four Indicators for Stock Market Appear to Be Calling for Caution.

"Home Builders Seen Tapping Public Market --- Plans by Taylor Morrison for an IPO Could Signal Beginning of a Trend, as Housing Construction Continues to Surge. Plans by home builder Taylor Morrison to sell stock in an initial public offering could be the first in a wave of private builders going public, a trend that could alter the ranks of the nation's top builders.Taylor Morrison, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., and which builds mainly higher-end homes in states from Florida to California, was a unit of British conglomerate Taylor Wimpey PLC until early 2011, when it was sold for nearly $1 billion to a group of U.S. private-equity funds. Last week, those funds filed a prospectus to sell $250 million of shares to the public.Alex Barron, an independent analyst with the Housing Research Center in El Paso, Texas, said now is ""an ideal time for a company like Taylor Morrison to consider going public,"" because investor appetite for builder stocks is strong and new-home sales and prices are on the rise.The Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index, which tracks seven publicly traded builders, is up 70% so far this year, although it has given back some of its gains in the past month. Sales of new homes hit a four-year high in September, and the $237,700 median sales price of a new home in October was 7% higher than in 2010, according to the Census Bureau.If Taylor Morrison's IPO is completed, the company would be the sixth-largest publicly traded home builder in the U.S. based on 2011 revenue, ahead of KB Home and behind Toll Brothers Inc.

A report from the International Energy Agency made a case for flagging demand -- the IEA lowered its prediction for fourth- quarter world demand by 500,000 barrels a day, thanks to signs of flagging demand in the U.S. and the former Soviet states.But reassuring words from Ali Naimi, Saudi Arabia's oil minister and the de facto leader of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, also help.

WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is taking a harder line on the perils of rapid growth, signaling that the Fed will keep raising interest rates unless consumer spending and the stock market quickly cool down.In his semiannual economic presentation to Congress, Mr. Greenspan dropped his assertion -- made a month ago -- that the Fed's attempts to rein in the economy with earlier interest-rate increases were ""well advanced.""Instead, he said yesterday that investor optimism and a bullish stock market have ""to date . . . more than offset"" the effects of higher rates and that spending even in sectors of the economy normally considered sensitive to higher rates ""has remained robust."" There is, he said, ""little evidence that the American economy . . . is slowing appreciably.""In a booklet presented to the House Banking Committee accompanying Mr. Greenspan's testimony, Fed staffers wrote that the continued surge in demand ""implies that the level of interest rates needed to align demand with potential supply may have increased substantially.""Markets have long been expecting the Fed to boost its target for the federal funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight -- by at least a quarter of a percentage point when policymakers next meet on March 21.

"Volcker presses for banking rules; Some senators say plans could threaten ongoing reform efforts. Former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker urged a Senate panel Tuesday to adopt new rules that would limit the investment activities of large banks as part of an overhaul of financial regulations, but lawmakers said the proposal could complicate ongoing negotiations on sweeping reform legislation.Volcker told members of the Senate Banking Committee that he supports government safety nets, such as deposit insurance for commercial banks, but that taxpayers should not be on the hook for risky practices that aren't aimed directly at helping a firm's customers.""There is not . . . a similar rationale for public funds -- taxpayer funds -- protecting and supporting essentially proprietary and speculative activities,"" Volcker said.Backed by Volcker, President Obama proposed the new rules last month in an effort to restrict banks from making speculative investments using their own capital -- an activity known as proprietary trading -- and from owning a hedge fund or private equity fund.Although receptive to the overall merits of the proposal, Banking Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) said that Congress had already spent months hashing out the details of regulatory reform and that the new proposals were ""adding to the problems of trying to get a bill done.""

President-elect George Bush is off to a good start in facing those key domestic and international economic issues that discouraged some potential candidates from seeking the presidency this time around. Democrats join in applauding a nearly flawless Bush operation so far, and almost everyone shows palpable relief that a tired and ineffectual Reagan administration is being swept away.It's much too early for euphoria. But there were two hopeful straws in the wind on the domestic front last week that seemed especially significant.First was Bush's appointment of two close friends-former Republican senator and party chairman Paul Laxalt and former Democratic congressman Thomas (Lud) Ashley-to be members of the National Economic Commission (NEC).Second was Bush's call for a reexamination of Third World debt strategy, known as the ""Baker Plan"" after former Secretary of Treasury James A.

"An Appraisal: Unusual Inflation Spurs Search for Different Hedges. When stock market investors hear the word inflation, they run for cover -- and often they can find refuge right in their own backyard.Investors have been hearing about inflation a lot lately, and they heard still more Friday. The Labor Department said the consumer price index, a closely watched barometer of inflation, rose 0.4% in March, or at a compound annual rate of 5.1%. Last year, the consumer price index rose just 1.1%.Friday's report only confirmed the accelerating inflation some stock market investors were anticipating a while ago when they jumped into gold stocks, traditional hedges against inflation. But those investors also bid up the average price-earnings ratio of North American gold issues above 50. So, investors who cower at the thought of rising inflation will have to pay dearly if they take refuge in gold.Although some analysts aren't sure the gold stocks are a particularly smart anti-inflation bet at their current prices, the analysts are also uncertain about where else investors can find a haven from inflation.Traditionally, precious metals and commodities have been safe places to park money during inflationary periods.

It emphasized that the outlook for inflation -- and not the latest inflation reading -- is now driving its interest- rate decisions. On that score, the Fed reiterated that its ""predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.""As widely expected, the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee left its short-term interest-rate target at 5.25%, where it has been for almost exactly a year.In the accompanying statement, it said, that ""readings on core inflation,"" which excludes food and energy, ""have improved modestly in recent months,"" a more optimistic assessment than at its last meeting, on May 9, when it said ""core inflation remains somewhat elevated.""But it added: ""Sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.

"Job Figures Stayed Bleak in Latest Month; Fed Acts Again to Cut Rates, Aid Economy --- Interest on Federal Funds To Slip to 6%; Some See End to Policy of Easing. WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve eased credit another notch Friday, continuing its effort to revive the economy.The move, which came shortly after the Labor Department announced a jump in the unemployment rate for February to 6.5%, will lower the interest rate on federal funds by a quarter of a point, to 6%. The federal funds rate is the rate on overnight loans between banks. It remains unclear what effect, if any, that move will have on mortgage rates or other bank lending rates.In the credit markets, short-term interest rates fell slightly after the Fed's action, but interest rates on long-term bonds rose.Chairman Alan Greenspan and other top Fed officials have said recently that the U.S.'s recession may be bottoming out, suggesting that the Fed's attempts to ease credit could end soon.

"Just Capitalism; Not all attacks on business are crazy. Here is the sane version.. THIS SERIES has described ways to address inequality: Increase tax progressivity; invest more in education; reform health care. But there's pressure to reach beyond that: to tackle inequality where it apparently originates, meaning the workplace. This pressure can be dangerous. Companies are not instruments of social policy; their first duty is to make money by serving customers, and they can provide for their workers only so long as they do that. Nevertheless, two sorts of corporate reform are warranted. It should be easier for labor unions to organize. And it should be harder for top executives to pay themselves outlandish sums.Union membership has fallen from 20 percent of the workforce in 1980 to 13 percent in 2005, and part of this decline is inevitable. It reflects attrition in the manufacturing industries that are most easily organized. It reflects the rise of sophisticated human resource departments that provide workers with training, savings plans and grievance procedures -- usurping some of unions' traditional functions. And it reflects the deregulation of domestic industries such as trucking and airlines, plus tougher foreign competition. These forces spur businesses to innovate, but they also constrain their ability to make wage concessions to unions. In competitive markets, companies will pay workers what it takes to prevent them from being lured away by rivals -- and not more.Yet the decline of organized labor also reflects a legal climate that is neither inevitable nor desirable. The way labor law is enforced now, employers can block attempts to establish unions by intimidating workers; a supervisor can summon an employee to daily meetings to discuss the dangers of unions or ban discussion of a union during work hours. If these tactics are not enough, employers can fire union organizers; although this is supposed to be illegal, the penalties are too feeble to serve as a deterrent. Meanwhile, a series of decisions from the National Labor Relations Board has narrowed the definition of workers who are eligible for union membership. Two months ago, for example, the three board members appointed by President Bush outvoted the two appointed by President Bill Clinton in ruling that relatively junior workers can be defined as ""supervisors,"" thus restricting their right to join a union.A fairer legal climate might reduce inequality slightly. According to David Card of the University of California at Berkeley, de-unionization explains about 15 percent of the increase in wage inequality among men over the past quarter-century. But the larger gain from reforming labor law would be political. Freedom of association is a core democratic right, and polls suggest that between 30 and 50 percent of nonunion workers would choose union representation if they had a chance to vote for it. The suppression of freedom of association is wrong in itself, and it fosters the suspicion that the rules of the economy are rigged against workers. Setting aside the debate over how much union membership can improve wages or benefits, the option of union membership is crucial to the legitimacy of capitalism.The same goes for rules on executive compensation. Since 1970, the pay of chief executives has jumped from less than 30 times the average wage to almost 300 times that level. This helps explain why the richest 1 percent of Americans pocketed 21.6 percent of all the gains in national income between 1996 and 2001, according to Ian Dew- Becker of the National Bureau of Economic Research and Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern University. As with the decline of labor unions, some of the rise in executive compensation reflects market forces and is inevitable. Yet similar market forces are at work in other advanced nations, where executive pay has grown more modestly. In 2003, the ratio of U.S. chief executives' pay to that of manufacturing workers was more than double the norm in 13 other rich countries.",0,0,0.6667,0.3333

"Health and the Budget. IF YOU LOOK AT the Berkeley and Brookings Institution projections that we have cited the past two days, two factors overwhelmingly explain the looming budget crisis. The first is the rising cost of servicing the national debt: In 2004, this comes to 1.4 percent of gross domestic product; by 2040, it will have shot up to 11.9 percent. The second is the growth in health programs for the old and poor. In 2004, the combined cost of Medicare and the federal portion of Medicaid comes to 3.8 percent of GDP; by 2040, it will come to 10.1 percent. To put that in perspective, the projected increase in health spending is nearly three times bigger than the projected increase in Social Security costs. And this forecast assumes that medical spending per beneficiary rises more gently than it has in the past. Extrapolate existing health inflation, and Medicare dwarfs all other budget challenges.The good news is that huge savings are possible in this area, though it would take huge political will to realize them. The United States currently spends 15 percent of GDP on staying well, fully six percentage points more than the average in rich economies. Some of that disparity is unsurprising, because America is richer than the average rich country: The more prosperous a society, the greater the proportion of its income it's likely to spend on health. But Uwe E. Reinhardt of Princeton University has calculated that U.S. prosperity explains only half of the six-percentage-point disparity. The other half reflects the waste that follows from a system in which doctors decide when care is necessary while also profiting when care is given.Even if this waste were confined to private health care, fixing it would help the federal budget. Most private health spending is tax-exempt, so squeezing those dollars into other segments of the economy would increase the tax take. But the truth is that inefficiency is rampant within Medicare as well. Elliott S. Fisher of Dartmouth Medical School has demonstrated that some parts of the country spend twice as much as others per Medicare patient, even after adjusting for regional differences in patients' health status and the cost of medical care. Moreover, Dr. Fisher has shown that low-spending areas produced health outcomes at least as good as those in high-spending ones. If all regions could emulate the most efficient fifth of the country, the cost of Medicare would fall by 30 percent.Enforcing efficiency will not be easy. Expensive regions are expensive because they have lots of hospitals and doctors; the medical folks are good at marketing their services. If the feds capped the number of heart surgeries or MRIs in each region, two things would happen: Doctors would market themselves even more aggressively to non-Medicare clients, and retirees would stage a revolution against ""rationing.""Suppose, in the spirit of this series, that this political constraint could somehow be overcome. What would that do to the future budget deficit? A 30 percent cut in Medicare spending in 2040 would save just over 2 percent of GDP; a similar cut in private health spending would boost the tax take, bringing the budget impact up to around 3 percent of GDP. With the 2040 deficit projected at 20 percent of GDP, this won't fix the problem.",1,0,0.6874,0.3126

"Economy is kick-started, but can it motor ahead?. Over the past year, the U.S. government has thrown almost every tool at its disposal toward making the economy grow again. And it has worked, at least for now.The trillion-dollar question for the economy now is: What will happen when those government supports are gone? While the government has successfully jump-started the U.S. economy, there are emerging signs that its engine still isn't running very well, and may even sputter out.The government has deployed about half of $787 billion in spending and tax cuts that were part of its stimulus package. It has executed the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program that boosted auto sales over the summer, and it has taken a wide range of steps to support the housing market. The Federal Reserve, besides cutting its target interest rate to nearly zero, has committed $1.75 trillion to unconventional programs meant to reduce interest rates.The combined results of all those efforts will be on display Thursday, when the Commerce Department reports on gross domestic product for the July through September quarter.

"U.S. News: Economists Split On Growth Recipe. One of the most buzzed about figures at the annual meetings of the American Economic Association in Philadelphia this weekend was Alvin Hansen, an economist who has been dead for nearly 40 years.Mr. Hansen posited in December 1938 that the U.S. was stuck in a period of profoundly slow economic growth he called secular stagnation, driven by slowing population growth and insufficient technological progress. He turned out to be wrong, but top U.S. economists are now hotly debating whether his ideas apply today, and if so what to do about it.The self-appointed heir to Mr. Hansen's theory is Lawrence Summers, the former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, who points to nagging sluggish U.S. growth since the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000 and proposes more aggressive government spending.Mr. Summers first raised the secular stagnation idea in November and pressed his argument during three days of meetings this past weekend.""Expansionary fiscal policy is the right primary response to our current woes, one that offers more potential than is generally imagined,"" Mr. Summers said on a panel at the conference Saturday.",1,1,0.0,1.0
"An Epochal Battle; Iowa kicks off the most wide-open race since '80; Looking beyond the Reagan-Bush era. When Iowa voters walk into their state's caucuses tomorrow night, they will be kicking off a milestone campaign year that promises a new political course for America.For the first time in 80 years, no incumbent president or vice president from either party is seeking the White House, creating an unusually unsettled campaign with no obvious front-runner. Power in Congress is divided so evenly between the two parties that neither has really been in control since the 2006 elections. Now, in the wide-open 2008 general election, voters will declare whom they want to run the executive and legislative branches.Americans will make that choice at a time when they are distinctly uneasy. Record numbers of voters are choosing to declare themselves politically independent -- and thus open to moving either left or right. Both the Republican president and the Democratic Congress are receiving historically low public-approval ratings, another sign of voter unease. More broadly, the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll has in recent months found the nation to be in the midst of the most prolonged period of public dissatisfaction in 15 years, as measured by the share of voters who say the country is ""on the wrong track.""In one sense change is inevitable. This year marks the end of what can be considered the Reagan-Bush era in American politics that began when Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980. In six of the last seven general elections, a candidate named Reagan or Bush has appeared atop a national ticket, defining a brand of internationally engaged conservatism that has been the dominant strain in American politics for more than a generation.Now the stage is set for an ideological rethinking in both parties. ""The mood for change is more than one of small incremental adjustments,"" write Republican pollster Bill McInturff and Democrat Peter Hart, who conduct the Journal/NBC News poll. ""It is concern for the next generation as well as widespread unhappiness with both President Bush and the Congress.""",0,0,1.0,0.0
"France Turns Left ;	France	Turns	Left  . FRANCE TODAY has the highest unemployment rate among leading industrialized nations. The triumph of the leftist opposition in Sunday's election reflects votersUa understandable ahxiety about this state of affairs. Unfortunately, the winnersUa program, if carried out, is likely to make the problem worse.' Conservative French President Jacques Chirac gambled when he called early elections, hoping for a parliament that would support him during the remaining five years of his term. Instead, his conservative allies lost badly to the Socialist and Communist parties. Now Mr. Chirac will uncomfortably share power with a leftist government led by a Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin.-As in any election, diverse factors of personality, tactics and policy played their parts. But the chief issue was one that confronts the United States and every other nation as well: how to balance the needs and desires of each countryUas population with the harsh rigors of economic globalization.In todayUas world, technology and capital are increasingly mobile; businesses can set up shop wherever profits will be greatest. Not only can ! hey; businesses that pass up opportunitiesUOout of loyalty to their home communities or countries, lor example, or by order of home governmentsUO may soon be passed by. Thus, nations find their own political possibilities limited; if they set taxes high to fund a generous social safety net, businesses will move away, shrinking the tax base and requiring even higher taxes.France has one of the highest tax rates around; public spending accounts for more than of half its total economy, compared with about one-third in the United States. Government employs one-quarter of all workers, compared with one in seven in the United States. Nationalization of industry does guarantee that some jobs stay in France, and generous benefitsUOearly retirement ages, for exampleUOare lovely for those with jobs.

"C 8 THE WASHINGTON POST, SUNDAY, JANUARY 8, 1 9 8 4  . Because unemployment has dropped and economic signs have turned more favorable, the Democratic candidates for president are being urged by political analysts, and even some of their own advisers, to downgrade the economy as a political issue and concentrate on foreign policy.This would be a very big mistake. It assumes that voters are ready to forgive President Reagan for his ill-conceived Economic Recovery Program, that supply-side fantasy that sent the economy into a tailspin, idling 33 percent of the nationUas productive capacity, driving unemployment up to 12 million, creating over $400 billion in deficits, boosting mortgage interest to 18 percent and, in the process, forcing cutbacks in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment compensation.That sort of polity, and the pall it cast over the economy until last summer, are not so quickly forgotten. The way Democrats can keep the issue alive is by pointing to the next four years. Long after the need for a shift in economic policy became imperative, Reagan was the one who insisted on UIstaying the course.U So it is almost certain that, at the first sign of renewed inflation, a second Reagan administration would send the average American through the economic wringer again. All of those who lost their jobs before would be out on the street again.If this does not have the makings of an effective election issue, I donUat know one when I see it. With some of the best media experts in the country on their side, such as Norman Lear, David Sawyer, Tony Schwartz and Robert Squier, the Democrats can present the economic issue in countless and ingenious ways.There is an even better reason for Democrats to stress the home front this year. The party out of power takes a real risk when it campaigns on foreign policy. An incumbent president controls both the initiative and the information in foreign policy.

"Contending That Money Growth Causes Growing Pain. Under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act passed two decades ago, the Federal Reserve is required to set targets for growth of the nation's money supply and explain twice yearly to Congress whether it has hit the targets, and if not, why not.In a time of high and rising inflation in the late 1970s, the hope was that the Fed would squeeze money growth, and in the process squeeze out inflation. That's because monetarist economists believed there are strong links between growth of the money supply and growth in the nation's gross domestic product.For a number of years beginning in 1979, the Fed focused tightly on money as it sought to reduce inflation. But then the links between money and current-dollar GDP became highly uncertain in the wake of sweeping changes in U.S. financial markets. As a result, the Fed now announces ""benchmark"" ranges for money growth rather than ""targets,"" and focuses on controlling overnight interest rates to stabilize the economy.The Shadow Open Market Committee, peopled by monetarists, this week complained the central bank ought to pay more attention to money growth, and warned that if it isn't curbed by interest rate increases there will be a resurgence of inflation.The chart at the right shows part of what the Shadow group is worried about: The measure of money known as M2 grew faster last year than the 1 percent to 5 percent range established at the start of the year. The Fed set a similar range for this year, and so far M2 has increased so rapidly as to stay above the upper limit.",1,0,0.6959,0.3041

"The Economy: April's Employment Data Show Third Straight Month of Job Cuts. Companies continued to shed workers in April, and the latest data gave little indication that a significant job-market rebound is imminent.In its latest monthly employment report, the Labor Department said U.S. nonagricultural companies eliminated 48,000 payroll jobs last month, following a combined decline of 477,000 jobs in February and March. Although the decline wasn't as steep as some had expected, other statistics in the report clearly suggested that the labor market is weaker than many economists anticipated.For example, job losses in the manufacturing sector were enormous; jobs fell 95,000 in April. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 6% from 5.8%. Most troublesome, the average workweek fell 0.3 hour, an indication that companies don't have enough work to occupy even those employees that remain after the latest cuts. Many economists say hiring will pick up only after there is an uptick in hours worked, since companies generally try to make their existing employees work longer before they hire additional people.In Washington, President Bush used the jump in the unemployment rate to spur members of Congress to pass a ""robust"" tax-cut package to stimulate the economy. Speaking to defense workers in California, the president took the issue of the rising jobless rate, a potential political liability, and turned it to his advantage. The rising unemployment rate, he said, ""should serve as a clear signal to the United States Congress we need a bold economic recovery package so people can find work.""Since the jobs report shows no sign of the postwar pickup that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has been predicting, it will probably make some already-pessimistic Fed officials even more convinced an immediate cut in interest rates is needed. However, Mr. Greenspan told Congress last week that only ""limited"" information is available on the economy's performance since war uncertainty began to lift, though he already knew the job market had weakened further in April. That suggests he will counsel patience at tomorrow's central-banking meeting, rather than advocate cutting short-term rates from their current, 42-year low of 1.25%.",1,1,0.0,1.0
"Consumer debt load is rising again despite a steady decline in confidence. WASHINGTON -- Watch what consumers do and not what they say.Despite steady drops in consumer confidence since the start of the year, consumers are borrowing again.

The Fed said the decline came about when $3 billion of loans were sold to groups outside the scope of its survey. If these loans had been counted in the survey, the report would have shown the tenth increase in a row.Auto loans in May rose a healthy $1.73 billion, or 7.9% at an annual rate, while credit-card debt and other revolving credit were up $942 million, or an annual rate of 4.3%.""The overall dip is nothing to be concerned about,"" said Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.

"Pluses and Minuses Regarding Visas for Foreign Ph.D.s. Gordon Crovitz's call for more high-tech immigrants repeats an argument we frequently see on the pages of the Journal ( Information Age, Oct. 1). Yet engineering work is shifting from developed countries to developing countries for a reason. Engineering, when done properly, follows international standards in proceduralizing the work. When engineering work is proceduralized, it can be outsourced, just as assembly work is procedural work that is more cost effectively done in low-wage developing countries. Importing millions of engineers from developing countries isn't going to change the macroeconomic laws that compel this outsourcing. It will worsen our economic plight because it works against our comparative advantage of integrating microeconomic behaviors into efficient macroeconomic function.Most promising developing countries cannot grow past low GDP per capita levels because their microeconomic behavior tends toward collectivism, cronyism, mistrust of others, safety nets, corruption, dishonesty and envious slamming of those who are richer or more powerful. To improve our GDP, we need people who believe in individualism, merit, trust in financial transactions/investing, honesty, hard work and grit. Those microeconomic behaviors are the only means of boosting our economic function beyond the high GDP per capita barrier that is unreachable for almost all countries.Tom FixBellevue, Wash.I am not opposed to letting skilled immigrants get a green card for working in the U.S. However, as the president of a high-tech company (six Ph.D.s among 17 employees), there is the risk of hiring too many of any one group, which will create a company within the company.

"Some Jobs Data Indicate a Slower Economy in May --- Though Unemployment Fell To 7.5%, Average Hours, Earnings Also Declined. WASHINGTON -- Although the unemployment rate dropped sharply in May, employment statistics for the month indicate the economy was growing much more slowly than in April.Civilian unemployment fell to 7.5% of the work force in May after sticking at 7.8% in March and April, the Labor Department said. A separate measure, which includes members of the military among the employed, dropped to 7.4% in May from 7.7%.The drop returned the jobless rate to its level of November 1980, when Ronald Reagan was elected president. Any further declines in the coming months will enable the president to claim during his reelection campaign that his administration brought down both inflation and unemployment.But the decline of the unemployment rate is more a reflection of the economy's previous strength than of its strength in May. While employment rose sharply during the month, the number of hours worked by the average employee declined from the unusually high level of April, and average earnings also declined. That suggests industrial production and personal income rose modestly in May, if at all.""We just exchanged bodies for hours,"" said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University.

"America's New Deal for Global Energy Mix. In 1973, Richard Nixon, in the teeth of the Arab oil embargo, pledged that the U.S. would achieve energy independence within seven years. Like his presidency, that didn't quite work out. Net imports provided 35% of U.S. oil in 1973. Seven years later, they supplied 37%, and by 2005, 60%.Now, that trend is reversing fast. In the 12 months ended in August, net imports met just 46% of oil demand. Similarly, net imports of natural gas climbed from 4% of consumption in 1973 to a peak of more than 16% in 2007, but were back under 9% in the year ended in August.This isn't energy independence. But just as America's growing energy-import dependence in the 1970s had implications of global proportions, so will this reversal four decades later.In natural gas, the opening of shale resources has caused excess supply and cratered prices. Despite calls to use more natural gas, demand hasn't caught up. That is why the likes of Cheniere Energy now want to liquefy and export natural gas to cash in on the spread between low U.S. prices and much higher European and Asian ones.Capturing the benefit of this price difference will be a central battle in the natural-gas market over the next decade. Exports of natural gas would tighten domestic supply, raising prices. That is risky politically. Michael Levi at the Council on Foreign Relations reckons those benefiting from the natural-gas glut--mainly utilities, petrochemical companies and heating consumers--are more organized politically than natural-gas producers and exporters. The argument that gas should be exported not in its raw form but as an input to American-made goods will be tough to ignore.",0,0,1.0,0.0

"The Outlook: Will Money Keep Economy on the Rise?. NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve for years has been calling on Congress and the administration to get fiscal policy under control, but the agreement reached on November 20 wasn't exactly what Fed officials had in mind. The deficit accord still faces hurdles in Congress and hardly stirred enthusiasm in financial markets. The tasks of the central bank, instead of being reduced, may actually have been increased.If the budget pact appears likely to restrain economic growth, the Fed must decide whether to offset it and, if so, how vigorously. An expansionary policy, designed to hold down interest rates, could further weaken the dollar, a prospect that worries at least some Federal Reserve officials. A deeper fall for the dollar could heighten inflation fears -- fears that still are held by some Fed officials.Most economists so far give Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan high marks for the central bank's actions since the stock-market crash on October 19. But some worries are creeping in. The Fed, as promised, flooded the banks with liquidity immediately after the crash, but the period of extreme ease ended quickly. After the first couple of weeks the central bank seemed to seek a more even keel, occasionally pulling reserves out of the banks.The situation is confusing the analysts. Those who focus on the money supply, such as Edward S. Hyman of the investment firm of C.J. Lawrence Inc., worry about a decline in M1, the narrowly defined money supply. ""Now that the market has settled down,"" he says, ""money may be stabilizing. Alternatively, these declines may indicate that the economy has weakened.""On the other hand, Robert J. Barbera, chief economist of E.F. Hutton & Co., is mainly concerned about the degree of pressure on bank reserves.

"Fall of REITs Puts Their Rhythms in Doubt --- Report in the Wake of Last Year's Performance Roils Debate About Correlation With Rates; 'There Are Other Factors at Play'. Do bonds and REITs march to their own beats?That question was the crux of ""Urban Legend: The Myth of REIT Interest Rate Sensitivity,"" a report issued late last year by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. It argued that the sharp decline in REIT stock prices wasn't so much the result of rising interest rates, but was due mainly to misperceptions by investors.The timing of the report was crucial. REIT stocks, which typically perform better than the broader stock market, had been trailing the market since May, when statements by the Federal Reserve prompted yields on Treasury bonds, along with other interest rates, to rise. NAREIT's goal was to convince investors that real-estate stocks shouldn't be viewed similarly to bonds, which tend to experience price declines when interest rates rise.But the report also rekindled a debate among real-estate investors about the very nature of REITs, why they have performed so dismally over the past eight months and what lies ahead in 2014 if interest rates continue to rise.""The urban myth is that there's a lock-step correlation between rising interest rates and REIT performance. There are other factors at play,"" says Michael Grupe, an economist with NAREIT. ""REITs are clearly not [bonds]. A lot of investors may look at them that way, and make decisions based on that, but it doesn't mean they're right.""",0,0,1.0,0.0

New vehicle sales rose by 7% on a same store basis, the company said.Mr. Jackson said in an interview he expects U.S. light vehicle sales will finish 2013 in the ""mid-15 million"" range, and added there is ""more potential on the upside"" of that forecast.While new vehicle demand should remain strong, Mr. Jackson said competition, particularly in the high-volume midsize car segment, is putting pressure on dealer profit margins.""New vehicle margins are under pressure,"" Mr. Jackson said. ""It's with the Japanese products. It's the mainstream, midsize sedans--Camry, Accord and Altima."" Those high volume models from Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. are facing tougher challenges by new models from Detroit rivals Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and Chrysler Group LLC, and Korean brands Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp.",0,0,1.0,0.0

"Moving the Market. Stocks fell as an initial burst of buying after the Federal Reserve's interest-rate cut wilted amid fears about the potential damage to banks such as Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and UBS from exposure to troubled bond insurers.The turnaround was due to a combination of technical resistance and rising fears about downgrades for bond insurers, said Lorenzo Di Mattia, manager of hedge fund Sibilla Global Fund. Downgrades ""would be devastating"" for banks, Mr. Di Mattia said.Fitch Ratings cut its credit ratings on one closely held bond guarantor, FGIC, a major player in municipal-bond insurance. Oppenheimer warned that credit-rating downgrades at major bond insurers could generate $40 billion in write-downs at banks in 2008. Oppenheimer said the write-downs would be concentrated at Merrill, which fell $1.38, or 2.4%, to $56.09; Citigroup, which shed three cents to 27.88; and UBS, which declined 79 cents, or 1.8%, to 42.26.Usually, shares of banks and lenders lead ""rate-cut rallies,"" because the more favorable borrowing rates allow them to turn a greater profit when lending out those borrowings.

Corn prices rose Monday after the U.S. Department of Agriculture cut its forecast for the size of this fall's crop, though the harvest would still be the nation's largest ever.Corn futures climbed 1.3% after the government said the corn crop will total 13.8 billion bushels. That is down 1.3% from the USDA's estimate last month but would easily break the record of 13.1 billion bushels set in 2009.The government trimmed its production estimate because it expects lower yields than it had projected last month.

"Public's Personality Seems Split in Its Perception of Reagan. President ReaganUas economic policies are unfair. Interest rates are out of control.

He is liked by three of every four Americans.That is a summary of what White House pollster Richard WirthlinUas surveys are reporting at the 18-month point of the Reagan presidency. The Wirthlin polls also suggest that Reagan has defused the nuclear freeze issue by his arms control initiatives and has generally improved his standing on foreign policy, even as it is slumping on economic performance.But the public perception of the Reagan foreign policy, like the policy itself, is clouded by events in the Middle East. Two of three Americans think the U.S. response to the Israelis after the invasion of Lebanon was too weak even though the Palestine Liberation Organization has the lowest standing of any institution or individualOverall, the dualism of ReaganUas standing with the electorate can be expressed in a single sentence: Three of 10 Americans who disagree with Reagan policies remain supportive of the president.

"The Year Ahead: World: Weak Recovery in Euro Zone Leaves a Lot to Be Desired. BERLIN -- The euro zone's recovery from crisis looks stuck in low gear, posing risks to its struggling members and weighing on fragile global growth.The world economy's most-troubled region in recent years is likely to grow at least a little in the coming year, extending a recovery that began last summer. But the slow pace could become a trap. Expected growth of about 1% is too little to bring down mass joblessness, which is testing social and political cohesion in weaker countries.Stubbornly low inflation of about 1% or less is also too low for comfort, because it's pushing weaker countries close to deflation and making it harder to bring down their debts.""We do have a recovery, of that we can be confident,"" says Julian Callow, chief international economist at Barclays in London. ""But the task is to nurture it, because it's not strong enough to make a significant impact on unemployment, which is the primary source of the disinflation.""The European Central Bank is the actor with the tools to do something about below-target inflation and falling bank lending.

"Economy in Full Swing (Watch Your Head). Volatility isn't just a Wall Street phenomenon. It is hitting Main Street, too.So far, incoming September economic reports have been surprisingly firm. Auto sales rebounded to their highest level since April. Chain-store sales posted year-on-year growth of 5.5%. The economy added 103,000 jobs, and manufacturing sentiment improved a bit. On Friday, Commerce Department figures are expected to show a strong 0.8% monthly increase in retail and food-service sales, while consumer sentiment may show some brightening of attitudes as well.What? If this feels like a 180-degree turn from August, it basically is. It would be one thing if this were a special case, or a broad turning point. But these jerky swings have become the norm. Consider what has happened so far this year: Real gross domestic product shrank in January and February, according to tracking firm Macroeconomic Advisers. Then it surged more than 1% in March. It contracted again in May and June -- only to jump more than 1% again in July.This isn't typical. Since 1992, monthly GDP has fallen about a third of the time when the economy hasn't been in recession. This year, even assuming a small gain in August, monthly GDP has fallen about half the time. It is even less common to see GDP growth above 1% in any given month; that usually happens only about once a year. In the first half of 2011 alone, it happened twice.No surprise, then, that stocks have been swinging wildly. After sinking to just shy of bear-market territory, the S&P 500 jumped nearly 8% in the eight trading sessions through Thursday. That rally is predicated in part on figures showing the U.S. is likely to avoid recession for the rest of the year. At least, in traditional terms.

"Employment Data Don't Ease Rate Fears --- Payrolls Expand by 310,000, While Hourly Wages Increase at a Fast Pace. WASHINGTON -- The July employment report did little to ease concerns that the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates to further reduce inflationary pressures.While July unemployment remained steady at 4.3%, hourly wages rose faster than at any time since January, and the economy added a higher-than-expected 310,000 nonfarm jobs. The report appears to bolster the view of those Fed officials who are advocating higher rates -- perhaps another quarter percentage point -- when the policy committee meets Aug. 24.For some Fed watchers, the jump in nonfarm jobs was the most troubling aspect of the report.

But occasionally they can find a nugget of accuracy in forecasts that largely seem to have gone awry.Ask Bernard Weinstein.

The group studied 14 states from Virginia and Texas in an attempt to track and project demographic trends to help plan for education needs, as well as economic and infrastructure development.Among the task force's particularly bold predictions: Southerners would finally make as much money as the rest of Americans by the year 2000.Although it isn't turning out that way for most of the South, Mr. Weinstein told a September symposium at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Florida is on track to making his prediction come true there. Indeed, the Sunshine State's per-capita income of $24,104 rose a solid four percentage points to 99% of the national average, and Mr. Weinstein says it may well catch up by about the start of the millennium.Meanwhile, for the South as a whole, per-capita income in the 14 states surveyed rose one percentage point to 90% of the U.S. average.

"How Big Government Hurts the Average Joe. During the debt-ceiling debate, President Obama characterized his push for higher taxes and less aggressive budget cuts as being helpful to the middle class. The claim was that failing to raise taxes on high-income earners would place a disproportionate share of the pain on the rest. But it is our record-high government spending, not the failure to raise taxes on the rich, that is the typical American's largest long-term problem.Workers do well only when the economy grows at a healthy and consistent pace. The biggest threat to long-term economic growth is government growth of the magnitude that characterized the past two years and that is forecast for our future.Our current problems are not a result of acts of nature. They stem from policy choices that dramatically increased the size of the government. In the past two years, the federal budget has grown by a whopping 16%. Importantly, growth in agency budgets other than Defense exceeded that in Defense, despite the surge in Afghanistan. The budget for Health and Human Services, for example, home to Medicare and Medicaid, rose a hefty 22%, as compared with 12% for Defense.The sum of 11 other agencies, such as the Departments of Agriculture, Education and Labor, which combined account for more annual spending than Defense, experienced an increase of more than 50% over the two-year period. Some of the budget increases, like those associated with unemployment insurance, should disappear when the economy rebounds, but much of the addition is permanent and is reflected in the president's projected future budget numbers.What has the increase bought us? The president would have us believe that but for the stimulus, the economy would have sunk into the next Great Depression. The numbers tell a different story. Estimates of the effect of the stimulus on gross domestic product (GDP) range from zero to three percentage points of GDP. The current recession set GDP back by nine percentage points relative to where it would have been had times been normal.",1,1,0.0,1.0
"What's Really in the Ryan Budget. Thanks to several years of fiscal restraint during the 1990s, the burden of federal spending dropped to 18.2% of gross domestic product by the time Bill Clinton left office. The federal budget today consumes more than 24% of economic output, a one-third increase since 2001 in the share of the U.S. economy allocated by politics rather than market forces. That makes the Republican House budget, which would reverse this trend, extremely important for the economic health of the country.Both political parties deserve blame for the spending spree that's put America in a fiscal ditch. President George W. Bush was a big spender and President Obama has compounded the damage with his stimulus spending and other programs.But the era of bipartisan big government may have come to an end. Largely thanks to Rep. Paul Ryan and the fiscal blueprint he prepared as chairman of the House Budget Committee earlier this year, the GOP has begun climbing back on the wagon of fiscal sobriety and has shown at least some willingness to restrain the growth of government.The Ryan budget has generated considerable controversy in Washington, and it will become even more of an issue now that Mr. Ryan is Mitt Romney's running mate. So it's an appropriate time to analyze the plan and consider what it would mean for America.The most important headline about the Ryan budget is that it limits the growth rate of federal spending, with outlays increasing by an average of 3.1% annually over the next 10 years. If spending is left on autopilot, by contrast, it would grow by 4.3% (or nearly 39% faster). If President Obama is re-elected, the burden of spending presumably will climb more rapidly.",1,1,0.3226,0.6774
"The Morning Brief: Bernanke's Regulatory Preference For a 'Light Touch' on Derivatives. The Wall Street Journal OnlineThe Morning Brief, a look at the day's biggest news, is emailed to subscribers by 7 a.m. every business day. Sign up for the e-mail here.Regulators, it seems, will always struggle to keep up with the ever- quickening pace of innovation in financial markets. Ben Bernanke's on- one-hand-and-on-the-other discourse yesterday about how to police derivatives markets lacked a clear prescription, but it did serve as a reminder that even the biggest macro policy making has something in common with individual investment decisions: a balancing of risks and benefits.Addressing the Atlanta Federal Reserve's annual financial-markets conference, the Fed chairman noted that the increasing prominence of hedge funds -- a subject he tackled last year -- and credit derivatives are part of the ""remarkable wave of financial innovation that we have seen in recent years,"" and one that has prompted boisterous debates about the need for more regulation. But central banks and other regulators ""should resist the temptation to devise ad hoc rules for each new type of financial instrument or institution,"" he argued. ""Rather, we should strive to develop common, principles- based policy responses that can be applied consistently across the financial sector to meet clearly defined objectives."" A big reason why: The sophistication and depth of financial markets promote economic growth by moving capital to where it can earn the best returns while dispersing risk more broadly among a wider field of investors, increasing ""the resilience of the system and the economy to shocks,"" he said.Any tampering with the likes of single-name credit default swaps, credit default swap indexes, and derivatives based on exotic interest- rates and foreign-exchange options -- in short, all the kinds of complex instruments created to transform risk into profit -- must also preserve the benefits of financial innovation, he said. What public policy makers must do, he noted, is assure financial stability in the marketplace, protect investors and safeguard the integrity of the markets. To do these things correctly, regulators need to know how to measure risk in the infamously opaque derivatives and hedge-fund fields. At the same time, Mr. Bernanke suggests it isn't fair to scrutinize only one particular class or category of investing field. ""If transparency about risk-bearing is important, then consistency seems to imply that full transparency should be required of credit markets broadly, not just of credit derivatives,"" he says. ""And why stop with credit markets? Do we know exactly who is bearing the risk in equity markets or foreign exchange markets, for example?""",1,0,1.0,0.0
"Ahead of the Tape. [Today's Market Forecast]Mortal CoilThe good news about last year's flat stock market? Stocks got cheaper. The bad news? They could get cheaper still.In 2005, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had one of the most uninspiring annual performances of its 109-year history, finishing the year down 0.6% -- which is to say almost perfectly flat. The broader market did a bit better, but with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gaining 3%, it, too, drew yawns rather than applause.But even as the market treaded water, corporate profits grew quickly. Company analysts polled by Reuters Estimates predict that earnings for companies in the S&P 500 increased 13.6% in 2005. Because the S&P 500 went up less than its earnings, it's price/earnings ratio slipped. On Friday, the S&P 500 closed at 16.4 times 2005 earnings. It finished 2004 at 18 times that year's earnings. In fact, it's the lowest S&P 500 P/E ratio in 10 years.",1,1,0.3306,0.6694
"Ehrlich Backs Slots At 3 Tracks; Most of $400 Million Would Fund Education. Republican gubernatorial candidate Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. said today that Maryland could raise as much as $400 million a year by legalizing slot machines at three horse tracks and that he would devote most of that money to improving public education.Ehrlich's comments came in sharp contrast to the position of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, who has staunchly opposed expanding legal gambling options to erase a projected $900 million revenue shortfall next year. Instead, Townsend proposes to help balance the budget through freezing most state spending.Ehrlich, in addition to endorsing slot machines, said he would need to chop 4 percent off the budgets of most state agencies, capture more federal funds and raise some state fees.The gaming issue surfaced again as a key political rift between the two candidates today, just as Maryland's largest gaming venues, its horse tracks, were undergoing a major transition. The owner of Pimlico Race Course and Laurel Park, the state's two premier thoroughbred racetracks, announced that he would be selling control of his company to a Canadian entertainment firm.Owner Joseph A. De Francis said the sale would further ""galvanize"" the debate over legalizing slot machines in Maryland.

"Break Up the Banks. Our leading financial institutions announced that they had actually made a profit in the year's first quarter through the creative manipulation of rules and regulations, lobbied Congress to preserve their ability to raise credit card interest rates just for the heck of it and opposed the administration's plan for restructuring Chrysler, which would save some jobs and honor pension obligations, in the hope that they can redeem the company's bonds at a higher level than they're trading at just now. And, to round out the picture, the Wall Street Journal reported this week that lending at the 19 largest TARP recipients was 23 percent lower in February -- by which time these banks had received hundreds of billions of dollars in public funds intended to enable them to lend more -- than it had been in October, before the floodgates of tax dollars had been fully opened.The week began with a burst of creative accounting. Citigroup, into which we've sunk more dough than any other company, with the possible exception of AIG, claimed a profit for the first quarter of this year because its bonded debt has lost value, which under the rules of accountancy enabled it to register a one-time gain equal to that lost value, because Citi could, in theory, buy back its own bonds for less. J.P. Morgan Chase, whose fire-sale purchase of Bear Stearns we taxpayers backed, declared a similar profit because of a similar decline in the value of its bonds.As events would have it, the very same Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase are the lead negotiators for the banks that are objecting to the Obama administration's efforts to restructure Chrysler. Chrysler's bonds, which these banks hold, are trading at 15 cents on the dollar, the amount the government offered to pay the banks in its initial proposal to restore the company to viability. Yesterday, the government upped that amount to 22 cents, plus a 5 percent equity share in the company. Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase, however, insist that they and their fellow banks are entitled to more, though that ""more"" could only come at the expense of Fiat (the auto company that is providing the new car lines and technology without which Chrysler will fold) or the company's retirees (to whose health-care fund Chrysler is legally obligated) who built the company, or the taxpayers who are keeping Chrysler alive.Instead of playing Scrooge (and a publicly subsidized Scrooge, at that), what the banks should do is lend Chrysler their accountants. Maybe they'd show that the company turned a profit last year.The banks' lobbyists, meanwhile, have been hard at work, too. Bills to limit credit card fees and penalties -- my favorite fee is the one banks charge some customers for making (not missing, making) a payment -- are moving through both houses of Congress, but the Senate version has yet to receive any support from Republicans. A bill that would enable bankruptcy judges to modify mortgage terms has also hit a wall in the Senate, with Republican leaders claiming the backing of all 41 of their members to filibuster the bill when it comes to the floor.",1,1,0.3667,0.6333

"Third-Quarter Economic Growth Figure Revised Upward to 3.9 Pct.. The U.S. economy continued its recent record of surprisingly strong growth last quarter, with the Commerce Department reporting a 3.9 percent gain in the July-September period, half a point faster than previously thought.The upward revision in the growth rate was due mostly to evidence that business investment in new equipment was greater than had been indicated by the initial figures released in October. The revised numbers were based on more complete source data, some of which is estimated in the advance release.This latest evidence that the economy is surging ahead pushed up short-term interest rates yesterday. Investors and traders said they expect the Federal Reserve might seek to cool off the economy by providing less cash to the banking system, a move that would boost key overnight interest rates again. The Fed raised its target for overnight rates earlier this month by three-fourths of a percentage point, the sixth increase this year.However, some analysts said the Fed likely would leave rates unchanged for the next two months as its policy makers wait to see whether this year's rate increases begin to slow economic growth.

"Likely OPEC Cutback Helps Push Oil Prices Up. Oil prices are beginning to recover from low levels that produced inflation relief and record-low pump prices, and so are oil industry stock prices, which contributed to the run-up in the Dow Jones industrial average yesterday.The rally, which has pushed crude oil prices up 33 percent from a 12-year low of $10.72 in December, resulted from different developments, according to oil industry experts. The prospect of further cuts in production when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Companies meets on March 23, a reduction in inventories and heavy demand for heating oil in Germany in advance of an increase in tariffs have all fed the trend.Yesterday the rally stalled and prices fell slightly, with April crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange dropping 38 cents to $14.31 a barrel. But many analysts continue to believe that the signs point to a production cutback by OPEC nations, which were meeting in preliminary sessions yesterday and today in Amsterdam.In the past, many oil-producing nations doubted Saudi Arabia's commitment to reducing production, several analysts said.

"For U.S. Now, $80 Oil May Be Tough to Bear. With pit traders screaming, ""Go, go, go"" -- and economists sounding alarms -- the world oil benchmark price briefly topped $80 a barrel yesterday for the first time.Last year, when crude was at similar levels, prices retreated and the economy stayed resilient. But this year, there are some significant differences, triggering concerns that prices could be headed higher and that the economy could be vulnerable.One main distinction: This time around, the economy isn't looking quite as healthy amid concerns about the weakened housing market and mortgage defaults.In addition, in 2006, oil inventories were higher because of market incentives to store oil, which meant energy buyers had a stockpile. By contrast, today, different market incentives have led to much lower oil inventories in key regions.That's troublesome, because the lack of a stockpile cushion means that any supply crunch could lead buyers -- oil refiners and speculators alike -- to quickly bid up crude-oil prices beyond $80 a barrel, just as the economy appears vulnerable to recession.",1,1,0.0,1.0

"Two Reports Upbeat On State of Economy: Retail Sales Up 0.4%; Inflation Under Control STII. The U.S. economy continued to hum along last month as consumers stepped up their spending at the nation's retail outlets, particularly at auto dealers, while inflation remained under tight control, according to two government reports released yesterday.The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0,4 percent, to $213.7 billion, the third monthly gain in a row. However, that was a smaller increase than in June or July, which was revised upward in yesterdayUas report to show a 0.9 percent gain for July, and was consistent with an overall pattern of moderate, noninflationary economic growth, a number of analysts said.Meanwhile, the Labor Department said prices charged by producers when they first sell a completed item rose 0.3 percent last month after an unprecedented string of seven straight monthly declines. The increase, which followed a cumulative drop of almost 2 percent in the producer price index in thejanuary-July period, was largely the result of a jump in energy prices, some of which have already been reversed.Over the past 12 months, producer prices for finished goods were down 0.2 percent Excluding volatile food andEconomists at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Corp., a New York brokerage firm, called it UIanother phenomenal inflation report.""

"TITLE XX REVISITED; An '80s Parallel On Cutting Strings. If the welfare debate has a familiar ring, it's because the language of block grants, state flexibility and innovation was part of a discussion more than a decade ago about how to save on social spending.In 1981, the Reagan administration successfully pressed Congress to trim Title XX of the Social Securities Act, a program that helped focus spending on child day care, home-based nursing and other social programs. The fix: Lump the money and turn it over to states as block grants with few strings attached.But instead of leading to the renaissance supporters had pictured -- with savings and improved services -- the changes reduced funding and forced localities to trim some programs, social workers now say.Welfare experts say the changes to Title XX provide one of the best parallels to reforms designed to end Aid to Families with Dependent Children. ""It's pretty much the purest form of block grant that people are talking about,"" said Michael Kharfen, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesman.One of the strings cut in Title XX was the requirement that states supplement federal grants with their own money. Some states responded by curbing spending. Dropping the requirement for state supplements paralleled the effects of inflation, so while the total federal block grants rose to $2.8 billion last year, the grants' value has fallen by 58 percent since 1977, according to a House Ways and Means Committee report.",1,1,0.3333,0.6667
"Take Social Security Off-Budget. The era of budget surpluses dawns, and the pilfering has already begun. Congress has just passed a huge transportation bill that busts the ceilings established by the balanced budget agreement just last year. And President Clinton, for his part, already has signed a bill containing a half-billion dollars of ""supplemental"" spending to pay for our Bosnia deployment.This not only broke Clinton's own pledge to save every penny of the surplus for Social Security. By blatantly abusing the loophole for ""emergencies"" (the Bosnia deployment is already three years old and open-ended), it mocked the deficit reduction rule enshrined in the budget agreements of 1990, 1993 and 1997 that all new spending must be offset by cuts elsewhere.We are now enjoying a glorious and unique economic moment. We have the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957. There is no inflation. Clinton has just announced a $39 billion budget surplus for 1998. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that it might run as high as $63 billion. How do we keep from frittering away the current bounty?Government cannot save its extra money by squirreling it away in a safe-deposit box. But it can do the equivalent by paying down the national debt, now a hefty $4 trillion. But how do you make politicians put away a surplus?A little history. In 1968, in order to pay for the war in Vietnam and pretty up the numbers of a surging budget deficit, President Johnson arbitrarily decided to include Social Security in the budget. Social Security was then, as now, taking in more money every year from workers than it pays out to old folks. It helped LBJ produce balanced books.",1,0,1.0,0.0

Currently, banks that sell those instruments are assessed an 8% capital charge on the security's full value. Under the proposed guidelines, the 8% charge would be applied to 20% of the value of their stake in the security, for an effective 1.6% capital requirement, the Fed said.",0,0,1.0,0.0

"The Lewinsky Budget. One of the great moments from the Starr Report is when Monica Lewinsky earnestly offers the American President her thoughts on education. But that was mere prelude to the federal budget President Clinton unveiled yesterday. Monica may yet be remembered as the face that launched a thousand new federal programs.Congress should call it the Lewinsky budget. The President's proposals for fiscal year 2000 represent a grab-bag bonanza that can only be explained as an attempt to repay the liberal Democrats in Congress who've stood by Mr. Clinton through scandal and impeachment.And what a reward it is: $1.833 trillion in revenue, which adds up to the greatest Beltway tax windfall in American peacetime history -- and all of it to be divvied up and passed around by politicians! The only losers are taxpayers, who under Mr. Clinton's proposal will have to ante up 20.7% of the whole economy to the feds. The era of big government is not over; the President has been born again as a tax-and-spend liberal.Just for reference: Only once this century has the U.S. government sucked up this much tax money, in 1944, when it took in 20.9% of the economy to fight Hitler and Tojo. But just one year later, in 1945, the tax take had fallen to 20.4% of GDP. Mr. Clinton now wants federal taxation to claim more of the economy than it did during the height of the Korean War (19% in 1952), Vietnam (19.7% in 1969) and the Cold War (19.7% of 1981). He is presiding, and intentionally so, over the only peacetime era in American history when taxes have gone up.It's this fabulous rush of revenues -- and not spending cuts -- that is mainly responsible for federal surpluses as far as the eye can see. From 1997 to 1998 alone, revenues climbed by $143 billion, or 9%, triple the rate of inflation. That followed a jackpot increase of $126.2 billion, or 8.7%, from 1996 to 1997.",1,1,0.0,1.0

"Fiscal '92 Budget Gap Now Is Estimated at $290 Billion, Smaller Than Expected. WASHINGTON -- Although the economy has long been in the doldrums, more money has been finding its way into the government's coffers than expected.The result is that when the figures are all counted, the deficit for fiscal 1992, which ended Sept. 30, should turn out to be about $290 billion. While that would be a record, exceeding the previous year's $269 billion deficit, it's far below the $368 billion that the Congressional Budget Office originally had forecast. The White House budget office once had assumed that the gap would be even greater: a mammoth $399 billion.Still, analysts say the surprising improvement for 1992 could prove to be short-lived, and they expect enormous deficits for the foreseeable future.Last summer, the CBO and White House pared their deficit projections to $314 billion and $334 billion, respectively -- mostly to reflect delays in deposit-insurance spending for the savings-and-loan cleanup.But in the short time since those revisions were made, the government has taken in more revenue than it thought it would, while spending has been somewhat less.

The New York-based investment firm estimates that 85% to 90% of Japanese purchases of foreign stock and 70% of the fixed-income securities purchases have been dollar-denominated, including U.S. government, agency and corporate debt and Eurodollar securities.A slowdown in new Japanese investment in the U.S. could have far-reaching implications. Foreign purchases of U.S. government and other dollar-denominated investments have helped fund the U.S. budget deficit, keep U.S. interest rates low and prevent the dollar from crashing. And the Japanese have played a leading role.Japan's long-term foreign assets at the end of last year totaled nearly $397 billion -- higher than the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' peak holdings of $380 billion in 1983. Japanese trading in U.S. Treasury securities climbed fivefold in the past 17 months and now accounts for as much as 15% of daily turnover, according to Michael R. Rosenberg, a vice president at Merrill Lynch & Co. ""They are an important force in our market and are going to remain such,"" he adds.",0,0,1.0,0.0
"REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial): The Banzai Pipeline. If Japan is worried by the sudden outbreak of protectionist bombast in Washington, welcome to the club. We too have been more than a little shaken by the King Kong roars from the House and Senate chambers this past week. They threaten to touch off jungle emotions no one could control. And nothing would halt the U.S. economic recovery or send U.S. living standards tumbling faster than a trade war with Japan.The most serious warning signal came Tuesday when a resolution was whooped through Sen. Packwood's Finance Committee demanding U.S. retaliation with tariffs and quotas unless the Japanese compensate Americans for sales lost because of ""unfair trade practices."" Sen. Dole wisely pigeonholed this document to give legislators a chance to cool off on their Easter holidays, but there is no guarantee they will return with any greater wisdom than when they left.As we have said here before, Japan is not blameless for this outburst of jingoism. Prime Minister Nakasone should have been more forthcoming when the U.S. asked for a fairer shot at the Japanese market for telecommunications equipment. The Japanese finally made concessions but Mr. Nakasone still is insisting that a Japanese committee should ""approve"" imported equipment, at least for the next year. That has a protectionist smell.It's inconceivable why Japan plays games like this. With its huge stake in international trade, it should strive to make itself one of the world's least protectionist nations. Its tariffs are lower than those of the U.S., but its non-tariff barriers are the rub. Mr. Nakasone has promised new ""market opening"" measures this month, but it will come as a big surprise if they are impressive improvements.The U.S. would be even more foolish, however, if it took steps to limit its trade with Japan. As George Gilder observed so astutely on this page last week, U.S.-Japanese trade is synergistic. Both sides benefit enormously, despite the U.S. ""deficit"" American mercantilists are always harping about. High-quality Japanese components are vital to high-tech U.S. products. Japanese competition keeps U.S. manufacturers on their toes. Most important, inexpensive Japanese goods help Americans raise their living standards, reducing wage demands on U.S. manufacturers.",0,0,1.0,0.0

In the summer of 1965, one of the most explosive government reports ever written disclosed that one-quarter of all black children were born out of wedlock.The report, by then-Assistant Labor Secretary Daniel Patrick Moynihan, touched off waves of alarm, then defensiveness, then recrimination. The subject proved so sensitive that public policy-makers became convinced there was nothing they could do to address it. Eventually, a protective silence descended.Twenty-five years later, there is a new statistic: More than one-quarter of all children born in America are born out of wedlock.The black out-of-wedlock rate has more than doubled to 63.5 percent (in 1988, the last year for which figures are available).

"Interest Rates Are Seen Pushing Higher Even When Economic Slowdown Appears.

"Smoking, Custom and The Law. Democracy rests on three assumptions: personal responsibility, individual rationality and the efficacy of information. Smoking, and attempts to hold cigarette companies liable for its costs, show how all three assumptions, although valid as generalities, are problematic in particular cases.How does society hold liable a manufacturer who merchandises, by regulated advertising, a product society makes legal? With difficulty, especially when the product is cigarettes. Since 1954, 321 suits have been filed against cigarette companies, which have not been forced to pay a penny in damages.A New Jersey court recently overturned a $400,000 award to a widower whose wife died of cancer at age 58 after 42 years of smoking. At issue was whether-prior to 1966, when government-mandated health warnings were put on cigarette packs-the manufacturer had misled the woman, knowingly or otherwise, about the risks of smoking. A related issue was apportioning to the woman her share of responsibility for her behavior.Some anti-smoking activists want to ban cigarette advertising. Constitutional protection of commercial speech is so limited that the Supreme Court seems to have held that if an activity can be prohibited, so can the advertising of it. Congress could prohibit the sale of cigarettes, so it can prohibit advertisement of them.But some of the $2 billion spent each year on such advertising is aimed at existing smokers and is designed to win market shares, not create new smokers. The most dramatic drop in smoking-17 percent in a decade-occurred in the United States, a nation saturated with cigarette advertising.",0,0,1.0,0.0
"Labor Market More Worrisome, Fed Officials Indicate.

"How Important Is Budget Surplus?: The writer is Business and Financial Editor of The Washing.

Rather than fleeing from emerging markets, Herro says he is looking to add to ""holdings in businesses that are good and able to withstand the shock"" of devaluations, deflation and recession.Unfortunately for Herro and his clients, the strategy has yet to pay off.

"Federal Swelling. Extraordinary affluence is obviously changing the nation's political agenda. Less obviously, and ominously, it is changing the nation's political sensibility, reducing to the vanishing point the once-sturdy concern for limited government.The nation's freedom and prosperity have been secured. The problems that dominate day-to-day legislative business--e.g., reducing pollution and congestion, improving medical care, providing more police--are not resource problems: The sacrifices involved in paying for such things are not prohibitive. Christopher DeMuth, head of the American Enterprise Institute, argues that although Americans are unprecedentedly prosperous, self-sufficient and at peace with one another, government continues to grow prodigiously because of little- understood dynamics.Government outlays (federal, state, local) and regulatory costs-- largely imposed on the private sector--have grown more than 50 percent faster than the economy for 50 years and now claim more than one-third of GDP. The federal government owns one-third of all land, pays for 40 percent of medical care, manages nearly 50 percent of individuals' retirement funds and regulates many industries. Most Americans live and work in a web of government rules.Forces working to inhibit government include globalization--the ability of capital and services to move to hospitable locales--and technological change. For a quarter-century, says DeMuth, the government has been trying and largely failing to regulate the computer industry: ""Although it may lasso an individual firm such as Microsoft, it has no hope of corralling the entire industry as it did trucking and railroads in an earlier age.""However, more private wealth means more resources for the traditional lobbying of government, and more incentives for government to try something new.

"FOR THE RECORD. The following is a report of how some major bills fared recently in Congress and a record of how local members of Congress voted.The House sent the Senate a bill (HR 743) giving companies leeway under federal labor law to operate employer-employee groups for addressing workplace issues and increasing productivity. The bill was supported by the Chamber of Commerce and opposed by the AFL-CIO. The 1935 National Labor Relations Act makes it an unfair labor practice for companies to financially support or dominate employee organizations. This bill eases that ban so that management and workers in non-union shops can participate in Japanese-style problem-solving teams set up and administered by management. Critics say such teams easily can become illegal company unions. A yes vote was to pass the bill.The House rejected an amendment requiring secret-ballot elections to pick employee representatives who sit with management on workplace teams authorized by HR 743 (above) within the framework of the National Labor Relations Act. The elections were to replace management selection of worker representatives. The amendment was backed by labor groups and opposed by business organizations. A yes vote supported the labor-backed amendment.The House sent the Senate a bill (HR 1170) making it more difficult for the federal judiciary to block a referendum approved by the voters of a state. The bill requires appeals on constitutional grounds to be heard by three U.S. judges rather than one, to prevent plaintiffs from ""judge shopping"" to find a sympathetic jurist. The bill was prompted by events in California, where Proposition 187 denying social services to illegal immigrants was approved by voters but found unconstitutional by state and federal courts and not implemented. A yes vote was to pass the bill.The Senate sent to conference with the House a bill (HR 2099) appropriating $80.9 billion in fiscal 1996 for a variety of departments and agencies.

"U.S. Government Bonds Wipe Out Early Gains; Treasury Note Auction Shows Interest from Indirect Bidders, Often a Sign of Interest from Abroad. Early gains in U.S. Treasurys evaporated Wednesday as investors balanced choppy growth signals abroad with the economic progress being made at home.In late afternoon trading, benchmark 10-year notes were unchanged in price to yield 2.359%. The 30-year bond erased gains to trade flat, yielding 3.094%. Bond yields decline when prices rise.The sideways drift kept the market in the tight range it has established since the start of the month. Bond investors have faced dueling forces of decent U.S. economic signals and uncertainties abroad, leaving the 10-year yield in a 2.27% to 2.40% range.While some bond analysts say U.S. economic conditions and the end of the Federal Reserve's active bond purchases would typically warrant higher yields, offsetting policies overseas are capping global bond yields, including those on U.S. Treasurys.The European Central Bank ""is helping the dollar and dollar-denominated securities by pledging to keep pushing their rates down to a level that stimulates the economies of the eurozone,"" said Kevin Giddis, head of fixed-income capital markets at Raymond James.

"Bargain Hunting on Bleak Friday; Holiday Shopping in a Downturn: Deals or Nothing at All. There were no Christmas miracles for retailers yesterday as the holiday shopping season officially got underway.Pent-up demand could have sent retail sales skyward. Or the economic crisis could have kept them in the red. It was all up to the throngs of shivering shoppers waiting in the dark, cold morning. Would they buy that $598 flat-panel television or a $379.99 Toshiba laptop? ""I would describe the customers as hit-and-run shoppers,"" said C. Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group, a consumer behavior research firm. ""They went in, they got the deal and they left. If the deal was sold out, they left without anything.""The day after Thanksgiving -- commonly called Black Friday -- is a key barometer of holiday spending, when retailers traditionally turn a profit. Retailers managed to rouse many shoppers out of bed through aggressive discounts in key categories such as electronics, toys and apparel, but consumers kept a close eye on their own bottom lines.Economists are closely watching this holiday season because the depth of the financial slowdown could depend on consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of the gross domestic product. The next few weeks are also a make-or-break period for retailers because they count on holiday sales to help pay their costs the rest of the year.""With the news of the economy, I wasn't certain of what to expect today,"" said Chris Poleto, general manager of Fair Oaks Mall.

"Index Changes Can Drive Stocks (and Investors) Wild. Technology highflier JDS Uniphase Corp. has been gyrating even more than usual of late, and its frantic dance tells something about a nasty little problem that is beginning to affect more and more investors:After more than 100 years of dealing with stock indexes, Wall Street still often can't revise an index without developing severe indigestion.Last week, it was announced that JDS Uniphase will enter the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index at today's close. The stock soared 26% on Nasdaq on Thursday and Friday. Then it fell 3.4% yesterday and Monday. If all goes as it usually does in such cases, the stock is likely to gyrate even more today, with a particularly big pop at day's end.These moves are caused by mutualfund and other portfolio managers seeking to mimic indexes even as other investors are trying to make money by anticipating such moves, and they can be disruptive. In December, Yahoo! Inc. gained more than 63% in the week before it joined the S&P 500. In the following weeks, starting well before the rest of the market turned down, its stock price crumbled more than 50%; it still isn't back to where it was when it joined the index, while the Nasdaq Composite Index is back to its December level.Even broader and, to some investors, more disturbing gyrations took place just last month.

"A Lender of Last Resort? Russian Crisis Shows the Need. It seems that postcommunist Russia poses a greater threat to global capitalism than the Soviet Union ever did. The Russian debt default in mid-August has generated financial shock waves that could drive next year's growth rate of the world economy to the lowest level in the postwar era. There are worrying signs that the U.S. will experience a credit crunch in the banking sector that could offset the benefits of lower interest rates. And while the European economy still enjoys moderate growth momentum, it will be highly vulnerable to an export slump if the rest of the world continues to slow.The magnitude of the correction after the Russian default illustrates how profoundly global financial markets have changed as new technology has driven down the cost of trading, hedge funds have gained access to leverage from bankers, and investors have developed an increasing appetite for risk following the long Wall Street boom. In turn, these changes have exposed how vulnerable the global financial system is, and underscored the need for an international lender of last resort.One vulnerability is the remarkable interdependence that has developed among markets because of the growth of global capital flows and the increasing role of highly leveraged investors in allocating capital. In the late 1980s, capital flows to developing countries were less than $50 billion. The Cold War's end and the growth of financial markets in developing countries drove this figure up to more than $300 billion in 1996.There has also been a dramatic expansion in the size of security markets. In the U.S., the ratio of stock-market capitalization to gross domestic product has nearly tripled during the 1990s while the mutual-fund industry now has greater assets than the banking system. The spectacular performance of the U.S. equity market stimulated an appetite for risk among high-income investors that encouraged a proliferation of new hedge funds. According to survey data, the U.S. now has more than 1,200 hedge funds with $200 billion to $300 billion in assets. During the 1990s these funds have become leading players in emerging markets.When Russia defaulted, it did not merely force some hedge funds to liquidate securities in other emerging markets. Instead, it produced such losses that many bankers felt compelled to curtail both their security market and their lending exposure in emerging markets. It also prompted some hedge funds to repay the low-cost yen loans they had taken out to finance security purchases and thus encouraged a large rally in the yen. Before August, few investors would have expected a Russian default to shatter Latin America's access to credit or produce a surge in the value of the yen, but such are the consequences of today's new global financial integration.",0,0,1.0,0.0
"Bonds Rally, Pushing Up Stock Prices --- But Late Selloff Costs Shares Some of Gain; Dollar Finishes Mixed. A bond market rally spread to stocks, pushing prices sharply higher in heavy trading before a late selloff cost the stock market much of its gains. But small stocks set a record. The dollar ended mixed.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 7.38 points to 3008.72 after rising as much as 30 points earlier in the day to just shy of its record 3035.33. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index hit an all-time high of 392.08 in intraday trading before ending up 1.60 to 389.62, a little more than one point off its closing record. But small stocks burst decisively higher, driving the Nasdaq Composite Index up 4.40 to 514.40. That eclipsed the previous record of 511.31.Traders said the stock market rally was prompted by rising bond prices that drove long-term interest rates sharply lower. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, for example, gained more than a half a point, or more than $5 for each $1,000 face amount, driving the yield on the issue down to 8.16%.The trading day started with the Commerce Department reporting that July retail sales rose 0.5%, considerably stronger than the 0.2% that many traders had expected. Bond prices dropped on the news, which implied that the economic recovery remains intact and could eventually spawn higher inflation. Stock prices followed bonds lower.But traders said that at midmorning, one or more big institutions began aggressively buying longer-term government securities, seeking to grab the significantly higher yields available on seven, 10 and 30-year notes and bonds. The demand for longer-term notes and bonds drove prices up. And as bond prices rose, stocks followed, spurred on by computer-guided buy programs.

"Greenspan Unafraid Of Energy Price Caps; Calif. Problems Ease, Fed Chief Says. In a broad analysis of the state of U.S. energy markets, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan last night disagreed sharply with the Bush administration's argument that capping spot prices for electricity in California would discourage construction of new power plants.""Analogies to the economics of office buildings are evident,"" Greenspan said. ""Few office buildings would be constructed in the absence of the ability to reach long-term leases. Short-term rental agreements are no more conducive to new office construction than spot prices for electric power are to the building of new power plants."" A copy of the text was released in Washington.California's energy problems appear to be easing, but they still represent a ""worrisome situation for Californians, certainly,"" Greenspan said. ""And because the state comprises one-eighth of our national [economy], it should be a concern for the U.S. economic outlook as well. Fortunately, the overall effects on the California economy, and on those of its neighboring states, seems to have been modest, at least to date.""Greenspan noted that large increases in the cost of gasoline and other petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity have hurt the U.S. economy in several ways. The most significant is the reduced profitability of non-energy firms, which has forced many companies to reduce spending for new plants and equipment.""As best we can infer, a substantial part of the rise in the total costs of corporations between the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year reflected higher energy costs, only a small part of which companies apparently were able to pass through into higher prices"" of the things they sell, he said.",1,1,0.3111,0.6889

"Bonds Slip in Light Session, but Analysts Expect Higher Prices in Coming Months. NEW YORK -- The bond market wound up the year on a quiet note as prices drifted lower in light trading.Some 30-year Treasury bonds fell 1/2 point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount. The U.S. government securities market closed at about 2 p.m. Wednesday and was closed yesterday for New Year's Day.In the final three sessions of 1986, prices of some long-term Treasury bonds slumped nearly two points, or almost $20 for each $1,000 face amount. The setback came amid concern about a recent surge in oil prices and the dollar's continued slump in foreign-exchange markets. These developments, along with a sharp increase in the price of gold Wednesday, have intensified fears among some investors about the inflation outlook.Most forecasters in recent surveys still expect higher bond prices in coming months because they say the Federal Reserve System probably will drive down interest rates in an effort to rejuvenate the economy.

"Both Parties Divided Over GOP 'Cliff' Idea; Proposal Would Reduce Federal Spending and Raise Tax Collections By Using a Different Index for Inflation Adjustments. Republican leaders are pushing what looks like a relatively painless method of slowing federal spending, one that alters how the government calculates annual cost-of-living increases for an array of programs.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) recently highlighted the idea, which is known as ""chained CPI,"" as an example of the kind of changes needed to avert spending cuts and tax increases set to begin in January. House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) included it in his recent deficit-reduction proposal.President Barack Obama has in the past signaled openness to switching inflation measures to shore up Social Security. And several centrist Democrats have endorsed the idea, too.But as with much of the ""fiscal cliff"" negotiations, nothing is as simple it appears. Even this seemingly technical change has become caught in the ideological gaps between the two sides.Under the Republicans' proposal, the government would stop pegging benefits to versions of the consumer price index that measure the change in prices for a hypothetical fixed basket of goods, the standard measure of inflation. Instead, the government would use the chain-weighted CPI, which tends to rise slower because it recognizes that consumers will buy less of goods whose prices are rising rapidly. For example, if the price of chicken rises more than the price of beef, families might buy less chicken and more beef.",1,1,0.3211,0.6789
"The New Nixon. George Bush is the new Nixon. Like Nixon, he entered the White House with vast experience. Like Nixon, he prefers foreign to domestic policy. Like Nixon, he is an awkward campaigner. But what he shares most with Nixon is the overpowering obsession to remain president - and like Nixon, he could be destroyed by it.Watergate flowed from Nixon's leave-nothing-to-chance passion to cling to power. Similarly, Bush wants to be president so badly that, in many ways, he has refused to be president. Excluding Desert Storm, his presidency has been the most risk-averse in memory. He has courted popularity by skirting controversy. It has been a losing strategy. He seems to stand for nothing and, thereby, offends almost everyone who cares deeply about anything.Somehow, Bush has created the impression that he doesn't deserve to be president. Had 1992 been a year of faster economic recovery, the president - enjoying the triumph of Desert Storm - might still have coasted to an easy victory. A contented electorate is uncritical. But a faltering economy makes people nervous and fault-finding. What Bush intended to be cautious governance has instead become remote indifference.The paradox for Bush (as it was for Nixon) is that the calculated effort to minimize political risk has done just the opposite. Watergate wouldn't have happened if Nixon had been more confident. He created the climate that inspired the burglary and subsequent coverup. Likewise, Bush has undermined his own popularity by his preoccupation with staying popular. He may have avoided offending this or that interest group, but the slavish devotion to public opinion has lost him a broader respect.Now, I would not stretch the Nixon parallel too far. Bush doesn't have Nixon's acute paranoia. Personally, Bush is far more straightforward. He has a ""genuinely easy and outgoing manner"" and ""dislikes confrontation,"" write Michael Duffy and Dan Goodgame, Time's White House correspondents, in a new book (""Marching In Place, The Status Quo Presidency of George Bush"").",0,0,0.6792,0.3208

""The closer you are to the consumer right now, the better,"" said David Ellison, manager at bank-fund FBR Fund Advisors, a small Boston money-management firm that has posted returns above 20% far this year.Mr. Ellison, for one, pared back his holdings in big regional banks such as Bank of America and FleetBoston Financial, long considered leaders of the banking industry.At the same time, he invested in lowly thrifts, unsung mortgage specialists like Golden West Financial and Astoria Financial, both of which have risen despite the current economic environment.",1,1,0.3223,0.6777
"Wall Street Sees Limited Storm Impact. Wall Street economists and money managers spent the long holiday weekend keeping close watch on the effects of Hurricane Katrina, with many saying that, despite the devastation, the long-term impact on U.S. and global economic growth should be muted.But several analysts also warned that global stock, bond, currency and commodities markets may react sharply in the coming days and weeks to any signs of prolonged energy supply disruption, depressed consumer spending or rapidly rising unemployment.""The economic and market implications of Katrina, and her ugly aftermath, remain highly problematic,"" Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG-Hoenig, wrote in a report to clients over the weekend. ""Most obviously, a slower trajectory for global growth now seems unavoidable. . . . U.S. consumer spending will take a hit in the months ahead.""Several Wall Street firms reduced their predictions for U.S. economic growth in the second half of the year, citing the impact of gas prices on consumer spending and the disruption of commodity shipments through the critical ports at the mouth of the Mississippi. Credit Suisse First Boston, for instance, reduced its estimated gross domestic product growth for the third quarter from 3.7 percent to 3 percent.William C. Dudley, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs & Co., wrote in a research note that the reduction in economic output should be limited to the next few months. But he said such an outcome was not guaranteed. ""The worst-case scenario is if the drop in consumer spending leads to significant [enough] job losses to push the unemployment rate materially higher. That could be sufficient to generate the type of dynamics that culminate in recession.""",1,1,0.3548,0.6452
"The Ocean Between D.C. and L.A.. This is a tale of two cities. Each is the seat of an empire, one built around political power, the other around entertainment. The 'tologist can tell you all about it because he's just back from L.A., which gives him the opportunity to say, repeatedly, ""I just flew in from the Coast."" (Of course no one on the Coast actually calls it the Coast. You have to not be on the Coast, or have any real knowledge of the Coast, to call it the Coast. Same with Frisco and the Big Apple.)If cities have an organic quality then Washington is a flower, the District a monumental pistil, heavily dusted with the pollen of modern city life, the Potomac a stem from which everything rises, the suburbs arrayed like petals, simple and lovely if somewhat repetitive.This is not to insult Los Angeles. In fact it can be a beautiful, mesmerizing place, which is one reason why upward of 10 million people live there. Los Angeles has big mountains, palm trees, good-looking people, beaches. One day I drove up to Point Dume and walked along the bluffs, the Santa Monica Mountains tumbling into the sea, seals swimming in the clear blue water, sea birds soaring on the updrafts. Someone was surfcasting, barefoot on the beach. Hardly anyone else was around. It was a Saturday morning; if you were in Washington and had gone to Sugarloaf Mountain on a sunny day like this you'd have found hundreds of people, acres of children scrambling around - mall meets mountain. But in Los Angeles there are mountain ranges in every direction, there's even a range right in town, the Hollywood Hills, and so people are spoiled. Their attitude toward nature is like that of a Washingtonian who sees the Lincoln Memorial every day but never goes there.So, yes, Los Angeles and its surroundings can be lovely, but they can also feel post-apocalyptic. Washington is still basically pre-apocalyptic, except for Democratic Hill staffers. Washington never has serious recessions, because government is incapable of doing anything but grow, and we don't have natural disasters, which happen in Los Angeles continually to the point where everyone walks around in this Death Is My Companion daze. Insanely they have built a city atop a piece of the Earth's crust that is fractured like a broken windshield. It's hard for anyone to be deeply serious about anything in Los Angeles, since they know that in a couple of hours they'll fall into a jagged crevice in the Earth's surface, never to be seen again. The typical Washington disaster? It snows some. That and term limits.Washington has history, a deep sense of its place in the creation of a nation. It's been here at least since the late 1800s, if memory serves. But in Los Angeles everything is new, disposable, with the texture of things not meant to age. Half a century ago Raymond Chandler wrote great stories about a private eye tooling around town finding bodies and getting beat up. If Chandler were still alive he'd have to have entire chapters about Philip Marlowe getting stuck in traffic. You can imagine the prose: ""I was headed for Bay City to eyeball a stiff. I turned off Melrose and took the 101 to the Harbor Freeway. It was a parking lot. The world had stopped. I put my feet up on the dash and read the funny pages. Something caught the corner of my eye, a flash of white in the HOV lane. Teeth. A blonde in a purring red Porsche. Her lipstick was the color of aortic blood. She smiled hugely. Her mouth was more than flesh and bone, it was a geological formation. She gave me a look I could feel in my hip beeper. I put the car in neutral and pressed down on the gas. She got the message.""",0,0,1.0,0.0

"Election 2012: Job Gains Drive Romney To Attack Obama Over Gas.

"Are We Running Out of Time for an Economic Lift?. Over the past 15 or 20 years, the amount of work done by Americans for pay has gone up dramatically, largely because more and more women have taken jobs outside their homes. This added source of labor helped boost economic growth, but the chart at the right suggests that this phenomenon may have just about run its course.The chart, the work of economist David Kelly of Lehman Brothers Inc. in Boston, is based on two norms in American society:So multiplying by 40 the number of Americans between those ages who are not in hospitals or prisons gives a measure of the total number of hours that would be worked if all those people had jobs and put in a typical week. That figure naturally rises as the population and work force grow.Of course, not everyone in the 16-65 age group either has a job or wants one. Millions of people, particularly younger ones, are full-time students. Additional millions of women, and some men, do not hold jobs because they are taking care of a home and, perhaps, children. Some have disabilities or illnesses that prevent them from working. Others may not need to work to make money, or, discouraged by unsuccessful searches for jobs, have simply quit looking. And finally, there are 7.9 million unemployed people looking for work.The line on the chart shows the actual hours Americans have worked as a share of potential hours. Fluctuating between 60 percent and 64 percent for many years, the share of potential hours being worked began to rise in the latter half of the 1970s, essentially because a rising proportion of women took jobs for pay instead of working at home for no pay.",0,0,0.6667,0.3333

National wireless operators such as AT&T, Sprint Corp.'s Sprint PCS business and Nextel Communications Inc. often work with smaller companies such as TeleCorp and Tritel to fill holes in their national footprints.In the case of TeleCorp and Tritel, Jackson, Miss., the companies operate wireless networks in certain markets, and both co-brand their service with AT&T. AT&T holds minority equity stakes in both companies.Indeed, the deal adds heft to AT&T's wireless network, consolidating two of its largest affiliates and accelerating the growth of its wireless network.

And she is bearish now -- perhaps bearish enough to make investors wish their vacations could last a little longer.To quote from Ms. Cohen's most recent report: ""The sharp decline in equity prices has not significantly improved the valuation of equities, since much of the decline has been offset by the rise in interest rates.""Moreover, she says, judging by the level of long-term rates now and Wall Street's consensus projection for corporate earnings, ""U.S. equities are still some 15% above a theoretical buy price.""",0,0,0.6525,0.3475

"Working Within the System. William Greider is wise. A former editor at The Washington Post and Rolling Stone, now national correspondent for the Nation, he wrote Secrets of the Temple, the best book ever on the Federal Reserve. In The Soul of Capitalism he quotes John Maynard Keynes and Thorstein Veblen, seeks out gurus like Clair Brown (of Berkeley), David Ellerman (of the World Bank) and Ron Blackwell (of the AFL- CIO) -- original minds who wander off the beaten track.Greider's starting point is that ""the United States has solved the economic problem."" Scarcity is no longer prevalent. Food, clothing, housing and entertainment are abundant. Markets, he believes, are intrinsically fair and efficient. Government, he accepts, tends to screw things up. Our remaining problems -- the rat race, the master-servant work relation, corporate greed, environmental decay -- are at bottom questions of values.For Greider, true American values are rooted in small-town Protestantism, descending from prairie yeomen of our agrarian past: communitarian, work-centered, custodial. The challenge is to express these values through the market system. This can be done, he believes, by realizing the full potential of institutions that already exist, within capitalism, on a small scale. Workers can be empowered through partnerships, cooperatives, Employee Stock Ownership Plans and the ownership potential of their pension funds. Investors with the virtues of Warren Buffett can tame the corporation. Ecologically responsible investor funds can save the prairies and the forests.The Soul of Capitalism proceeds by case and anecdote. We meet Avis Ransom, ""an idealistic MBA graduate who left her business consulting career to manage Solidarity,"" a cooperative Baltimore temp agency. There is (amazingly) David Stockman, Greider's one- time breakfast partner, who in his earlier capacity as budget director under the first Reagan administration, scandalized Washington in a tell-all profile that Greider published in the Atlantic Monthly, but who has now reinvented himself as a ""labor- friendly"" turnaround consultant to companies battered by recession and the fallen market. There is William McDonough, an architect who is presently ""consulting Nike on how to make a running shoe that will be biodegradable."" It is all quirky, entertaining and hopeful.Yet as you meet each new member of Greider's inspired band, you can only wonder: Are they anything more than fringe cases, stitched into a quilt that exists, mainly, in the author's mind? A few supporting statistics would have helped, but Greider, who has previously woven tight empirical narratives around everything from presidential budget policy to global currency speculation, here pretends to dislike numbers. In a passage on the potential of socially conscious investing, he writes that ""commonsense logic may be more reliable than mathematical formulas."" A moment's thought explodes the notion. It is certainly possible for a well-chosen subset of socially conscious companies to outperform the average. But if everyone chose socially conscious portfolios that exceeded the average, would the return stay high? Can the average outwit the average? Of course it can't. By construction, socially conscious investing is a fine art, as are many of the other activities Greider describes in The Soul of Capitalism.",0,0,1.0,0.0

"Junk-Bond Funds Absorb Big Hits --- High-Yield Sector Declines Along With Stocks, Creating Possible Buying Scenarios. The past two months have been punishing ones for investors in ""high yield,"" or junk-bond, funds.After a few years in which these funds outstripped most other types of bond funds, they have recently fallen hard, in step with the stock market. Some other bond funds, by contrast, have eked out recent gains that partly offset investors' stock-market pain.The recent performance of junk bonds shouldn't be any surprise to investors familiar with the odd hybrid nature of below-investment-grade bonds. ""Sometimes these securities trade with the general bond market and sometimes they trade with the stock market,"" says Earl McEvoy, manager of Vanguard Fixed-Income Securities High-Yield Fund.

"Officials Try to Talk Euro Into a Rebound --- Currency Slips to New Low; ECB Member Renews Discussion of Intervening. European officials tried to talk up the euro after it hit a new low against the dollar in European trading. But the jawboning -- including renewed talk of intervention from one European Central Bank official and a suggestion from a finance minister that the euro could rise 20% -- did little to spur markets to bid up the struggling common currency.In late New York trading yesterday, the euro stood at 82.94 cents, just above its record low of 82.28 cents earlier in the day. Currency-market traders said officials' silence on the euro after a Group of 20 meeting in Montreal prompted the euro's slide to the new low.""The ECB will do all it can to achieve its objective of price stability, without excluding the possibility of intervention,"" said Eugenio Domingo Solans, an ECB executive board member, in Madrid. Mr. Domingo said the solid state of the European economy will ""sooner or later"" cause the euro to rise.The weak euro is at the root of inflation in Europe, and doesn't help the economies of the U.S. and Japan either, Mr. Domingo added. Last month the ECB, the U.S. and Japan intervened in the currency markets to prop up the euro, which initially rose but has fallen further in the past two weeks because markets doubt the U.S. would be willing to intervene again before the presidential election. In a sign of how sensitive markets are to the threat of intervention, the euro rose to its high for the day after Otmar Issing, the ECB's chief economist, reiterated what has become the central bank's party line: Intervention is a tool at the bank's disposal.Laurent Fabius, France's finance minister, stated the euro has the potential to rise 20%. ""On the whole, Europe is in a positive position. We are not managing to get that across,"" Mr. Fabius said in Paris.

"Promotion Brings Couple Of Problems. Q: I work at a federal agency. We have a nondiscrimination policy against homosexual people. Most people don't have a problem with this. But a question has come up about a couple who have a special relationship and who have moved back and forth around the country together. Recently, one of the couple was promoted, and she selected the other as her employee, which was a promotion. That has left management in a quandary about the situation. Morale has declined rapidly as other employees feel favoritism has occurred. Married couples who are heterosexual or other workers with a familial relationship are not allowed to enter into this supervisor-employee relationship. It doesn't seem fair that it is permitted with this relationship.A: There is widespread consensus that romantic relationships between bosses and subordinates aren't good business practice because, as in this case, they can stir allegations of favoritism, hurt morale and productivity, and even lead to sexual harassment lawsuits if they later go awry. An American Management Association survey in 1994 found that three-quarters of corporate personnel officials said they disapproved of relationships between higher- ranking and lower-ranking employees. But because companies are cautious about treading into the area of personal relationships, only about 6 percent of the firms had policies banning them.The rules are more clear-cut with married couples. In the federal government, there are specific nepotism rules that forbid public officials from hiring, promoting or even offering special training opportunities to a wide array of legal relations, including spouses, fathers, mothers, children, cousins, in-laws and step-family members, according to the Office of Personnel Management, the government agency that oversees personnel matters for many branches of the government.But these rules do not apply to gay people, who cannot legally marry. Consequently, the OPM does not have any rules governing supervisors and subordinates in homosexual relationships, according to an OPM spokesman, who said he also believed it would be an awkward issue to raise at work without appearing to pry into people's personal lives.The OPM is not unusual in not having rules addressing this issue, said Sue Meisinger, chief operating officer and executive vice president of the Society for Human Resource Management in Alexandria.",0,0,0.6667,0.3333
"Shadow of Noose Speeds Up Banking Union; The deal euro-zone leaders are expected to agree upon is far more substantial than had seemed possible.. Nothing concentrates a man's mind quite like the prospect of being hanged in the morning, observed Samuel Johnson, the 18th century English writer. In a similar vein, two factors helped concentrate the minds of European governments in recent weeks as they thrashed out important details of the euro zone's proposed banking union.The first was the European Parliament elections scheduled for May next year. These are expected to result in large gains for euro-skeptic and extremist parties, which could make it much harder to agree on complex legislation involving a substantial pooling of sovereignty.The second is growing anxiety in the markets and among some policy makers that the euro zone is sliding into deflation. With interest rates already close to zero and no easy way to further loosen monetary policy, a credible banking union is the euro zone's best chance to reduce financial fragmentation and reduce borrowing costs in the periphery.The result is that euro-zone leaders are expected this week to agree upon a far more substantial banking union deal than had recently seemed possible. This deal will include a legally binding set of arrangements for the winding up of failed banks--the so-called Single Resolution Mechanism--to be headed by a Single Resolution Board with access to a Single Resolution Fund to help pay for the cost of clearing up bank failures.The speed with which the deal has fallen into place has surprised officials.

An $80 million cut in state aid earmarked for local school programs had been suggested by Gov.It is dear, however, that the most appealing aspect of the new budget-bal-jjpcing proposals is the hope they of- fer M avoiding an. increase in either * the-state sales or Income taxes. There are obvious political reasons for . i avoiding these Increases, but many legislators also feel that major taxes should be raised only during even-numbered-year legislative sessions when Virginia's two-year budget is adopted. The odd-year sessions, like the current one, are supposed to be short and concerned with minor budget adjustments and general legislation.	V",0,0,0.6667,0.3333
"Board of Contributors: At Sea With Surpluses. For at least 30 years the U.S. has had, or at least professed, one fiscal policy: Reduce the deficit, ideally to zero, preferably within five years.I was never crazy about this policy. I never attached significance to the number ""zero."" The only thing one could say about zero was that it was $100 billion less than $100 billion and $100 billion more than negative $100 billion. This becomes obvious if you think of all the different plausible ways there are to define and measure budget surpluses and deficits.In the early Reagan years, when the deficit was large, I was not among those most eager to reduce it. Although I believed that the deficit was retarding growth by absorbing private saving that would have been productively invested, I thought that we were a very rich country and had more important things to do than speed up growth. I was a strong supporter of the defense buildup and feared that the deficit argument would be used to restrain it.Grand Goal in SightI changed my mind recently as the deficit declined; this year, the grand goal of zero seems finally achieved. In fact, I came to believe that balancing the budget was not enough and that we needed to get to a surplus. What changed my mind was the ever-clearer prospect that we would run huge deficits in the 21st century as baby boomers claimed their retirement and Medicare benefits. Although I was not one who wanted to maximize future growth, I would not like to see the growth of per capita income turn negative, and I was afraid that would happen if the federal deficit was so large as to absorb all private saving.",0,0,0.6491,0.3509
"West Germany's Central Bank Cuts Key Rate --- Little Impact Is Expected On Currency Markets Or Nation's Economy. FRANKFURT, West Germany -- The West German central bank, as expected, cut the interest rate it charges on securities-repurchase agreements with banks, a move that appears likely to fall short of its goal of supporting the dollar by widening the gap between German and U.S. interest rates.The Bundesbank yesterday called for interest-rate tenders on 28-day securities-repurchase agreements at a minimum rate of 3.5%, well below the 3.8% rate it had been asking since January. Market experts estimate that the actual rate to emerge from bidding today is likely to be closer to 3.6% or 3.65%. But they expect the Bundesbank to use later tenders to continue to push the rate lower, possibly to 3.3%.The repurchase facility is the central bank's principal open-market means for refinancing the banking system with funds backed by securities. Yesterday's Bundesbank action signals broad declines in capital-market interest rates, and could lead to lower credit rates charged by commercial banks.The West German move complements a recent lowering of short-term interest rates in Japan and a tightening of credit by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. Those two steps were aimed at stabilizing exchange rates.However, foreign-exchange traders said the Bundesbank's action didn't have any immediate effect on the currency market and that small interest-rate movements are unlikely to significantly outweigh other factors weakening the dollar, including the U.S. trade deficit.",0,0,1.0,0.0
"Mutual funds: Bond funds post tidy gains for '92 despite flat 4th quarter. NEW YORK -- Bond mutual funds turned in a workmanlike year in 1992 despite a flat fourth quarter.Taxable bond funds had an average 7.87% return for the year, including price changes and reinvested dividends, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., a Summit, N.J., company that tracks mutual fund returns. That total return exceeded the 3.1% inflation rate, but it lagged behind stock funds' 8.88% average return.The year's best performers were junk bond funds and convertible bond funds, which, like the stock market, got a boost from the long-delayed economic recovery. But foreign bond funds were hurt by currency upheaval in Europe.Taxable bond funds finished with a nearly flat fourth quarter, gaining a scant 0.18%. Prices fell and yields rose on intermediate- and short-term debt securities, reducing the funds' returns.The respectable gains come at a time when bond fund sales are soaring. Investors, disenchanted with lowly yields on money market funds, poured $88.4 billion into bond funds during the first 11 months of 1992. Last year's inflow was the second-best ever, surpassed only by 1986, when bond funds pulled in $108.6 billion.",1,1,0.0,1.0
"Growth Pace Is Slowest In 3 Years, U.S. Says;Rise in GNP Drops to 1.7% in Quarter. Weak consumer spending and a sharp decline in housing construction limited U.S. economic growth to only a 1.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter, the slowest pace in almost three years, the Commerce Department said yesterday.The increase in the gross national product, adjusted for price changes, was down sharply from the first quarter's 3.7 percent rate and last year's 2.8 percent gain. However, more than half of the first quarter's rise was attributable to an assumption that farm production would return to normal this year following last year's widespread drought.Excluding the bounceback from the drought, the 1.7 percent rate of increase in GNP-the nation's total output of goods and services-was actually slightly larger than in the previous quarter. Taken as a whole, the report did little to resolve the increasing debate over whether the nation is headed for a recession or just a period of slow growth.Meanwhile, there was mounting evidence that the Federal Reserve has taken another small step to reduce interest rates to avoid a recession. The federal funds rate, the interest rate financial institutions charge one another on overnight loans, remained close to 9 percent for the third straight day, down from the 9 1/4 percent level the Fed had been targeting since early this month.A number of analysts said they were almost fully convinced the Fed is now aiming at the lower figure for the federal funds rate, a key number to which most other short-term interest rates are tied. The analysts also said they expect all major banks shortly to lower their prime lending rate from 11 percent to 10.5 percent, as Chase Manhattan Bank did two weeks ago and Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB did yesterday.",1,0,1.0,0.0

"Credit Market Springs to Life --- Signs of Confidence in World Economy. Companies are aggressively borrowing in the debt markets once again -- a sign of renewed confidence in the world economy following recent fears that struggling European countries could have difficulty financing their budget deficits.In the U.S., bond sales by companies such as Bank of America Corp. and GMAC Financial Services are on pace to conclude their busiest week since the beginning of the year. In Europe, borrowing by companies so far in March is already more than 60% of February's totals.""It tells us that financial liquidity is very much on the rise,"" said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service. ""No longer do corporations suffer from a dearth of liquidity. This puts them in a better position to take advantage of opportunities that arise.""So far in 2010, U.S. corporations have issued $195.2 billion of debt, excluding government-guaranteed bonds, according to data provider Dealogic, up from $166.8 billion during the same period in 2009. The resurgence of the corporate debt markets comes after a shaky February, when several companies were forced to delay bond sales as worries about Greece's problems sent investors fleeing to safer assets such as U.S. Treasurys. Those concerns have subsided and money is again flowing into corporate bond funds, giving managers cash to invest.Risk premiums, the extra interest corporate borrowers pay over U.S. Treasurys, are falling again for corporate bonds. This allows companies to seize the opportunity to borrow cheaply. The raft of sales point to an increase in economic activity as companies can use the money on new business spending, hiring and mergers.

The House voted Thursday to make permanent a tax break allowing small businesses to write off up to $500,000 in new equipment purchases.While the move adds to momentum for congressional efforts to extend a range of now-temporary tax breaks, it also sharpens a conflict between the House and Senate over whether to extend the breaks permanently or temporarily.Thursday's vote was 272-144, with several dozen Democrats joining Republicans to support the measure.The list of temporary tax breaks, many of which expired at the end of 2013, has grown over the years and now includes over 50 separate provisions affecting businesses as well as individuals.By now, the cost of making them all permanent is proving to be prohibitive--almost $1 trillion over the next decade.

"Tax Changes Spark Innovation In Bonds for Small Borrowers. LAST YEAR'S federal tax legislation has already had one of the effects intended by the free-market thinkers who designed it: There has been a sharp cutback in interest-rate subsidies. That has forced many small businesses with financing needs into the public credit markets, where the cost of borrowing is higher.But the tax legislation also has spawned innovations aimed at keeping the added interest burden to a minimum. ""We're in the infancy of a whole new bond-financing technology,"" says Ronald E. Muller, chairman of Developing Systems Ltd., a Washington, D.C., company that designs financing mechanisms for businesses and government agencies.A prime target for cutbacks on subsidized interest rates were industrial development bonds, a source of low-cost financing that had grown increasingly popular over the past decade. Issued by state, county or other municipal development agencies on behalf of small-business borrowers, IDBs had two main attractions. First, the interest they paid was exempt from federal taxes. And second, banks could deduct 80% of the interest they paid to borrow money to invest in IDBs. That made banks by far the biggest buyers of such bonds.The tax bill took several whacks at tax-exempt IDBs. It disallowed their use in many kinds of projects, particularly real-estate development. It cut in half the amount of such IDBs a state could issue each year. And, most important, it eliminated the 80% exclusion for banks, which lost much of their incentive to buy the bonds.THE IMPACT was dramatic. The Council of Industrial Development Bond Issuers in Washington estimates the volume of new IDBs issued by state and local development authorities on behalf of small businesses in 1986 was only about half the previous year's $17.5 billion total. (Though the tax bill didn't become law until Jan. 1, 1987, uncertainty about its provisions kept banks out of the market for small-issue IDBs most of the year.)",0,0,1.0,0.0

"Cross Country: Jerry Brown Shrinks From Real Reform. Sacramento -- California has led the nation in so many ways, so it seems fitting that it is now showing the rest of us what the collapse of an overburdened welfare state looks like.In January, Democrat Jerry Brown returned to the governor's office he left 28 years ago. He assured voters that as a seasoned government hand he wouldn't repeat the mistakes made by his novice predecessor, Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. Mr. Brown had shown a pragmatic, pro-business streak during the two terms he served as mayor of Oakland from 1999 to 2007. Many Californians hoped that at age 72 Mr. Brown would be the first Golden State governor since before Ronald Reagan without his eye on the presidency -- and thus could make tough decisions despite the opposition of entrenched special interests.The state certainly needs bold action: It faces an immediate $26.6 billion deficit. David Crane, a financial expert who worked for Mr. Schwarzenegger, estimates that the state's public- pension obligations could be as high as half a trillion dollars. California's credit rating is the worst in the country, and it's unlikely to return to pre-recession employment levels until the end of this decade.Mr. Brown has, at best, a mixed record so far. He won points for keeping a campaign promise and refusing to push for tax increases without having them approved by voters. But his plan to close this year's deficit -- with a combination of spending restraint and extensions of temporary tax hikes on income, sales and vehicles -- has faltered.It looks as if the special election to pass this plan, currently scheduled for June 7, will either be delayed or not held at all due to inaction by the Democratic legislature. To get his plan on the ballot, Mr. Brown needs the votes of two Republicans in both the state Assembly and the Senate to satisfy the two-thirds requirement for tax increases. He's unlikely to get official cooperation from the GOP unless he gives on something significant, like pension and regulatory reform. Otherwise, he'll have to target individual Republicans with inducements.",0,0,1.0,0.0

The number of weeks could be reduced, however, if the national unemployment rate, currently 7.5%, drops below 7% for two consecutive months.The finance panel's plan is far closer to administration proposals than the version passed Tuesday by House Democrats. The House bill would offer up to 26 weeks of emergency jobless benefits. Both jobless packages, however, face administrative opposition.The $5.4 billion cost of the legislation approved yesterday would be covered by eight tax-raising measures.

"Employment Continued to Climb in May --- Jobless Rate Held Steady At 4.3% as 296,000 Jobs Were Added to Payrolls. WASHINGTON -- Last month's robust job gains signal that economic growth in the second quarter -- even amid a trade-damping Asian financial crisis -- might not be slowing as much as economists previously believed.The unemployment rate stayed at its 28-year low of 4.3% of the work force in May, suggesting that April's drop was no aberration. The economy added 296,000 jobs in May, the Labor Department said. For the past six months, job gains have averaged 257,000 a month and the labor market has been taut.Wage gains were also healthy during May. Average hourly earnings for nonsupervisory workers increased four cents to a seasonally adjusted $12.73. Average weekly earnings increased 0.9% to $441.73. Average weekly earnings and average hourly earnings have both risen 4.3% during the past year -- without many signs of inflationary pressures.The economy, though slowing from the 4.8% gross-domestic-product growth rate posted in the first quarter, still continues to generate jobs. Certainly, the Asian financial crisis has had an effect. The manufacturing sector has slowed its rate of growth in the second quarter, and manufacturing jobs declined 26,000 last month, the third drop in the past four months. Those declines, however, were offset by the brisk-paced service sector, which accounted for all of May's job gains. Business services, retail trade and financial sectors all boosted their payrolls in May.""This shows that overall we can weather shifts in the economy,"" said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, who used the manufacturing fall-off to underscore the importance of the International Monetary Fund's proposed Asian relief package. ""We need to support it"" to keep the Asian situation from worsening, Ms. Herman said.",1,1,0.3636,0.6364

"U.S. Brings Mixed Message to Asia Forum --- Clintonites Push Free Trade but Urge Some Restraint. WASHINGTON -- The Clinton administration is delivering a mixed economic message to Asia this week: Boost your ailing economies through trade liberalization, but don't export so much that it hurts U.S. companies and their workers.And the trade message is bound to be diminished because of President Clinton's absence from a leaders' meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Wednesday because of the Iraqi confrontation. Vice President Al Gore will be attending in Mr. Clinton's place.""If I were still in the administration, I'd be throwing up over this issue,"" Robert Litan, a former Clinton economic official who now directs economic studies at the Brookings Institution here, says of the contradictory trade signals. ""As a free trader, it would make me sick to my stomach.""Many of the president's advisers also have heartburn managing fallout from the Asian financial crisis. At the same time that Vice President Gore will be lecturing Asian leaders to cut tariffs and reform their economies, the Commerce Department is helping the U.S. steel industry to fend off Asian imports. Later in the week, if the Iraqi crisis ebbs, Mr. Clinton plans to fly to Japan and South Korea, in part to press the steelmakers' complaints.The administration's economic officials argue that unless they can protect American workers from surging imports caused by Asian countries anxious to boost their economies, congressional support for easing trade barriers -- already tenuous -- will collapse. Even though such efforts undermine U.S. free-trade proselytizing, the administration says it has no alternative.",0,0,1.0,0.0
